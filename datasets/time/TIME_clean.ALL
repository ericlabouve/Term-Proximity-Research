the allies after nassau in december 1960, the u.s . first
proposed to help nato develop its own nuclear strike force . but europe
made no attempt to devise a plan . last week, as they studied the
nassau accord between president kennedy and prime minister macmillan,
europeans saw emerging the first outlines of the nuclear nato that the
u.s . wants and will support . it all sprang from the anglo-u.s .
crisis over cancellation of the bug-ridden skybolt missile, and the
u.s . offer to supply britain and france with the proved polaris (time,
dec . 28) . the one allied leader who unreservedly welcomed the polaris
offer was harold macmillan, who by thus keeping a separate nuclear
deterrent for britain had saved his own neck . back from nassau, the
prime minister beamed that britain now had a weapon that " will last a
generation . the terms are very good . " many other britons were not so
sure . though the government will shoulder none of the $800 million
development cost of polaris, it has already poured $28 million into
skybolt and will have to spend perhaps $1 billion more for a fleet of
missile-packing submarines . at best, the british will not be able to
design, build and prove its nuclear fleet before 1970, three years
after britain's bomber force has presumably become obsolete . then what
? tory backbenchers are loudly skeptical of what they call " the
small type " in the nassau pact, which stipulates that britain's
polaris submarine fleet, except when " supreme national interests "
intervene, must be committed to a truly multilateral nato force . does
that mean that britain will eventually have no strike force of its own
? who will decide when or whether national interests justify
withdrawal of submarines from nato, particularly if those national
interests conflict with u.s . policy ? the biggest question of all is
whether france's inclusion in the offer was a deliberate ploy by jack
kennedy to end or at least downgrade britain's prized " special
relationship " with the u.s . the cartoonists went even farther . they
not only showed supermac jumping to superjack's commands, but de gaulle
and adenauer as well . as edith said . the french, who got no help from
the u.s . in developing their force de frappe, were quick to crow that
britain's vaunted ties with the u.s . had brought it nothing but
humiliation . by contrast, bragged french officials, the skybolt fiasco
only vindicated france's decision to develop its own bombs and delivery
systems . thus, though charles de gaulle promised to " reflect " on the
polaris offer, there was little likelihood that he would accept any
offer that would subject a french force to allied control . it is de
gaulle's unswerving conviction that if the russians were actually to
invade western europe, no nation that was not directly attacked meaning
the u.s . would invite nuclear devastation by helping its allies . thus
unlike britain's bomber force, which all along has been pledged to "
the western strategic deterrent, " france's force de frappe will be
responsible only for france's defense . at the same time, de gaulle has
long argued that the atlantic alliance could be run most efficiently by
a triumvirate that would include france as an equal of the u.s . and
britain . this is one of his major, if unspoken, conditions for british
membership in the common market ; and de gaulle suggested pointedly to
macmillan that it would help if britain were to share its advanced
missile technology with france . when macmillan replied noncommittally
that he would have to discuss this with kennedy, de gaulle told his
guest with hauteur that france in that case could do nothing to ease
britain's entry into europe . go-it-alone grandeur . konrad adenauer,
on the other hand, is fearful that de gaulle will snap up the polaris
offer and in this way achieve his goal of a three-nation nato
directorate . though his government vowed in 1954 not to manufacture
nuclear weapons, adenauer has become increasingly apprehensive that
without them, and with no say in their use, west germany will be
relegated to second-class citizenship in the alliance . last week an
official bulletin even revived the old, bitter cry that u.s . pleas for
greater reliance on conventional forces are aimed at raising german "
cannon fodder " for u.s . " atomic knights . " a frosty letter from the
chancellor to president kennedy suggested that germany, which already
supplies almost 50 per cent of nato ground strength, does not intend to
raise any more divisions for conventional warfare . yet u.s . strategic
planners reason that the only credible deterrent to soviet attack is a
strong army on the ground, backed by the vast u.s . nuclear arsenal .
fact is, the british and french nuclear weapons could never be used
independently of the u.s . against russia without inviting devastating
soviet retaliation . after all their efforts, the british and french
will have managed to create a nuclear capacity that represents only 4
per cent of u.s . nuclear power . " it is just a damned nuisance, "
said a state department official last week . " it means nothing
militarily except that we will be expected to bail out the first
country that throws the first pea at the russians or anyone else . "
charles de gaulle could hardly be expected to agree, at least until his
force de frappe becomes obsolete . for britain and germany, the
multilateral deterrent makes immediate sense . eventually, france, too,
may well find a nato-controlled polaris fleet, or its possible
successor, a european minuteman arsenal, the only answer to the
spiraling cost and diminishing value of go-it-alone grandeur .

russia who's in charge here ? it was in 1954 that nikita
khrushchev launched his grandiose " virgin lands " gamble . part of the
plan was to plow up 32 million acres of marginal land in kazakhstan,
and settle it with communist " pioneers, " who were to plant and
produce huge quantities of desperately needed grain within two years .
nikita's scheme flopped . there was not enough rainfall, and the
pioneers did not take to tractor life on the bleak frontier . except
for 1958, each harvest has been lower than the previous year's . worst
year of all was 1962, when the virgin lands delivered only half their
quotas . naturally, khrushchev takes none of the blame for the fiasco .
three years ago he found a scapegoat in kazakhstan party boss nikolai
belyaev, fired him for his " errors . " last week belyaev's successor,
dinmukhamed kunaev, was similarly bounced for " lapses " in his work .
for good measure, moscow also purged the former premier of the
territory from the local party's central committee . it was perhaps no
coincidence that nikolai ignatov, 61, a onetime khrushchev crony, last
week abruptly left his post as a soviet deputy premier after only nine
months on the job . farm expert ignatov had the misfortune to be boss
of a special committee to boost food production .

berlin one last run hans weidner had been hoping for months to
escape drab east germany and make his way to the west . the odds were
against him, for weidner, 40, was a cripple on crutches who lived in
the village of neugersdorf, 115 miles southeast of the frontier of
freedom but hans weidner did have one major asset, the bus that
he operated for the local communist regime . it was an ugly thing, and
ancient . its chassis creaked, and the engine coughed ; a
cream-colored coat of paint could not disguise the welts and bruises of
two decades of chugging service . in fact, the bus was ready for the
junk pile when weidner decided to press it into service for one last
run . sharp blades . the hazards would be great on the journey to the
border ; so weidner signed up a fellow villager, jurgen wagner, 22, to
take the wheel . eight days before christmas, the pair began the
feverish preparations in weidner's garage . first weidner and wagner
attached a heavy snowplow to the front of the bus, not to plow snow,
but to scoop away the heavy obstacles they knew awaited them at
roadblocks ahead . to all six lugs on each front wheel they bolted
sharp blades of the toughest steel, affixed so that the whirling edges
would chop barbed wire to bits . then they wedged one-quarter-inch
sections of steel plate inside the bus to stop bullets . at last all
was ready . on christmas eve, weidner and wagner piled their wives and
four children aboard, not forgetting three tons of household belongings
. for added protection the plotters shoveled a ton of coal and potatoes
into the back of the bus . then they chugged off north toward berlin
along back roads to escape communist patrols . just before they reached
the wall, they planned to swing west in order to enter the east-west
autobahn leading to the u.s . sector of the city . en route, the
radiator froze in the subzero weather . that fixed, they were only a
few miles farther when a tire blew out . the kids were crying and the
wives shivering with cold and panic when, at last, they arrived at
drewitz, the most heavily guarded checkpoint on the entire autobahn to
berlin . it was no time to stop and reconsider . flying potatoes . "
wah-ah, wah-ah, " shrieked the police-type klaxons that weidner had
thoughtfully installed in advance . the communist guards obediently
raised the first of three barriers . but what was a bus doing on
emergency duty ? suddenly the shooting began too late . wagner, at 40
m.p.h., was already crashing through the second barrier 100 yards
ahead, then the third, only 20 yards away . its windshield smashed, its
passengers shaken, its cargo of coal and potatoes in every corner of
the cab, the old bus finally lurched to a stop a few miles down the
road where the communists no longer mattered at the u.s . checkpoint, a
foot or two inside west berlin .

the congo round 3 ? the sound of
christmas in katanga province was the thunk of mortar shells and the
rattle of machine guns . after an uneasy twelve-month truce between u.n
. forces and the troops of katanga's secessionist moise tshombe, a few
minor incidents got out of hand, and for the third time since september
1961 the province was in turmoil . blue-helmeted u.n . soldiers swarmed
through elisabethville, seized roadblocks on the highways . swedish u.n
. saab jets swooped low over katanga's airfield at kolwezi, destroying
four planes on the ground and setting oil tanks ablaze . in the first
skirmishes, seven u.n . soldiers were dead . the fighting began with
what elisabethville residents call " l'affaire simba " a reference to
simba beer, the local brew that both sides guzzled on and off duty . as
the u.n . told it, boozed-up katangese gendarmes suddenly opened fire
on a detachment of ethiopian u.n . troops in suburban lubumbashi . as
tshombe described matters, a few tipsy ethiopians started the shooting
by scrambling atop a 200-ft . slag heap outside the big union miniere
plant and taking potshots at the katangese . fireworks next . in any
case, katangese soldiers at a golf course on the outskirts of
elisabethville took the occasion to shoot down an unarmed u.n .
helicopter moving overhead . they stoned the six surviving crewmen,
pummeled them with rifle butts ; a 23-year-old sikh lieutenant, who
lay helpless with a machine gun slug in the abdomen, died unattended in
three hours . indian brigadier reginald noronha, commander of u.n .
troops in katanga's capital, was furious this is the last time, he said
. " next time there are going to be fireworks . " noronha did not have
long to wait . three days later an ethiopian guard fired a warning shot
at a katangese soldier who was approaching his post . unhurt, the
katangese rolled down a hill in search of cover, but his comrades
thought he had been hit and opened fire . soon u.n . positions around
the city were under attack . tshombe " agreed " to a cease-fire, but
his 20,000 men kept right on fighting . " they are mad, " said a red
cross official who saw them rampaging through a township, firing at
anything that moved . " they are killing their own men . " the u.n .
claimed tshombe had lost control of his men which gave it an excuse to
strike back . from manhattan u.n . headquarters, orders were flashed to
the 12,000-man u.n . force in katanga : " take all necessary action in
self-defense and to restore order . " spearheaded by 5,700 tough,
bitter gurkhas, the u.n . force methodically swept disorganized
katangese troops from their guardposts on the road to northern rhodesia
. power lines fell in the fray, leaving shabby little elisabethville
(pop . 180,000) without light, water or phones .
spears & arrows . noronha demanded once more
that tshombe call a ceasefire, warned that unless he complied in 30
minutes, " a general war will begin . " tshombe rejected the ultimatum,
and the u.n . went over to an all-out air and ground offensive . the
indian brigade stormed and captured the headquarters of katanga's
gendarmerie at karavia, a mile from elisabethville, with little
resistance . another column of troops advanced northwest toward
jadotville, in the heart of the copper belt that gives tshombe $40
million a year in revenues . u.n . forces announced that they had taken
over elisabethville's post office, radio station and railway depot and
had occupied tshombe's palace . at the height of the shooting, tshombe
vanished into hiding, but he was not calling it quits . " everywhere,
the u.n . and its troops will be fought with traps, with poisoned
arrows and spears, " he said in an angry statement through one of his
aides . " we will resist by all means, including the total destruction
of all our economic potential . " was this the final showdown in the
u.n.'s 2f-year attempt to end katanga's secession from the congo ?
u.n . spokesmen insisted that it was not, but secretary-general u thant
says he is convinced that unless tshombe is subdued soon, premier
cyrille adoula's central government in leopoldville will collapse . the
u.s . agrees, and the state department recently has been talking up the
imminent danger of a leftist, soviet-backed takeover in leopoldville .
but the british, who see katanga as a stable buffer for the rhodesias,
warned against the " futility of trying to impose a political
settlement by force . " the french, who, like the british, have heavy
investments in the union miniere, want hands off, and in brussels, 200
belgians demonstrated their feelings by marching on the u.s . embassy
shouting, " down with kennedy !

tunisia double jeopardy as a dedicated tunisian nationalist,
president habib bourguiba, 59, is a popular hero to most of the
millions who have followed him since independence was won in 1956 . but
bourguiba also has his deadly enemies . last week a determined group of
the latter almost succeeded in assassinating tunisia's stocky
chieftain . the plotters actually made two attempts on bourguiba's life
. the first try failed on dec . 15 because bourguiba did not spend the
night at his presidential palace at carthage, near tunis . the plotters
next laid their plans for midnight, dec . 21, and even bourguiba's
personal bodyguard agreed to lead the killers to the president's
bedside . no replacement . a few hours before midnight, a tunisian army
non-com burst in upon a defense ministry official and blurted the
details of the plot . that night, and on following days, more than a
hundred plotters were jailed . they proved to be a handful of dissident
army officers and some disgruntled landowners . but the hard core
seemed to be supporters of bourguiba's old foe, the late salah ben
youssef, who lost a bitter struggle for control of neo-destour,
tunisia's only political party, and went into exile in 1955 . when ben
youssef was murdered in west germany in 1961 his followers back home
blamed bourguiba agents, swore vengeance on tunisia's boss himself .
the plotters' only plan, apparently, was to slay the president . said
bourguiba : " after my death the country would have been in a state of
total anarchy . the plotters thought only of eliminating me, not
replacing me . " crowds gathered to hear official speeches of
indignation at the attempt on bourguiba's life . there seemed little
doubt that he still held the nation's basic loyalty, but even his
closest friends were concerned at the recent signs of unrest caused by
three successive years of drought and an unemployment level of 400,000
out of a populations of 4,000,000 . bourguiba is also aware of the
muttering of many about the three expensive new palaces he has recently
built . these " belong to the state, " he retorted in his " i am alive
/ speech . he added with some bitterness : " there is a tendency to
forget that i spent 30 years in french jails for my country . " knocked
heads . in his efforts to reshape tunisia as a modern nation, bourguiba
has had to knock heads together . inevitably, some army officers resent
the backseat role he gives the military . and moslem religious leaders
are angered by his attempt to abolish the day-long fasts of the month
OF RAMADAN, AND BY HIS EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN . A U.S . investigating
committee in 1961 agreed that bourguiba was making the right moves to
solve tunis's economic ills, but warned that he might be asking too
great sacrifices of his people . after last week's brush with death,
bourguiba may go forward a bit more slowly, and can undoubtedly draw
some support from the fact that last month the u.s . finally agreed to
grant tunisia $180 million in economic aid over the next three years .

kashmir talking at last the british raj, which once
controlled india's northwest frontier province of kashmir, exacted a
token annual tribute of two kashmiri shawls and three handkerchiefs
from the maharajah . never since has the price of peace been as small .
in the years after independence in 1947 split the indian subcontinent
into the sovereign states of india and pakistan, the two nations have
paid with strife and bloodshed to establish their conflicting claims
over the disputed region . last week, after 15 years of bitter
wrangling, indian and pakistani delegates finally met in the pakistan
capital of rawalpindi to seek a solution to the kashmir problem . the
disputed land is the size of minnesota, lakes and all . it falls from
the windwhipped mountains of gilgit and ladakh in the north to the
idyllic vale of kashmir . in the himalayas, primitive mountain
tribesmen keep herds of graceful, sure-footed kashmir goats, whose soft
fleece becomes the cashmere of fifth avenue and regent street ; the
cool lakes near kashmir's capital city of srinagar are dotted with the
elegant houseboats of wealthy indians . vow forgotten . at the time of
partition, kashmir, like all of india's 562 princely states, was given
the choice of joining either pakistan or india . the fact that 77 per
cent of kashmir's 4,200,000 people were moslem pointed to control by
moslem pakistan . but though he had signed preliminary trade and
administrative agreements with pakistan, kashmir's hindu maharajah
began to hedge . angered by his failure to accede to pakistan, hordes
of pakistani " volunteers " swept into kashmir to establish pakistan's
claim to the land . in terror, the hindu ruler opted to join india,
appealed for immediate military aid . india was happy to respond,
airlifted troops into kashmir to fortify its own claim . thus began a
full-scale war in kashmir . india went to the united nations for relief
. in 1949 the u.n . demarcated a cease-fire line that gave india the
richest two-thirds of kashmir, including most of ladakh, the vale, and
the predominantly hindu area of jammu . but india's prime minister
jawaharlal nehru had pledged that " the fate of kashmir must ultimately
be decided by its people . " declared nehru : " we are prepared, when
peace, law and order have been established, to have a referendum under
some international auspices like the u.n . " nehru soon forgot that
vow, for it became obvious that kashmir would vote either for
independence or accession to pakistan . indian kashmir's moslem ruler,
sheik mohammed abdullah, an old friend of nehru's and a fiery kashmiri
nationalist, confused things by starting to promote a local
independence movement . india clapped sheik abdullah into jail in 1953
and introduced a series of repressive measures to halt other
nationalist or propakistan movements . except for three months in 1958,
sheik abdullah has languished in prison ever since, was last week on
trial on charges of conspiracy to overthrow the government . nudge from
the north . the imprisonment of sheik abdullah symbolized all of
pakistan's deep distrust of nehru . despite his outward devotion to the
u.n., no amount of u.n . pressure could bring nehru to the bargaining
table with pakistan over kashmir . but when red china thrust deep into
india's himalayan borderland last october, nehru reluctantly yielded to
the insistent envoys of the u.s . and britain who suggested that unless
india and pakistan settled their differences, there would be little
hope of defending the subcontinent against chinese aggression .
hotheaded extremists in both countries opposed the idea of talks .
kashmir is not for sale, screamed an indian headline ; in pakistan's
national assembly, politicians argued that communism was far less an
evil than " hindu domination . " where was the room for negotiation ?
officially pakistan maintained that an overall plebiscite is the only
solution to the problem . but privately pakistan has fallback
positions, is willing to hold regional referendums that would give
india both jammu and ladakh . the real issue, however, was kashmir's
vale . pakistan seemed agreeable to the internationalization of the
important region . nehru, however, feared that secession of any part of
kashmir would encourage separatist movements in other indian states
with strong nationalist tendencies . nevertheless, indian officials
showed up in rawalpindi for the start of negotiations last week . they
were prepared for almost any surprise but the one that actually arrived
. on the eve of the conference, pakistan suddenly announced an
agreement " in principle " with red china for a complete settlement of
their mutual border differences . to the indians it was a stunning
blow, for it seemed that the pakistanis were deliberately using the
chinese bogeyman to blackmail them into yielding better terms on the
kashmir question . after two days of no progress, the rawalpindi talks
were adjourned for three weeks .

among crowds dutifully waving chinese and mongolian flags, tsedenbal

speeches . then, on the same day that red china announced plans to
define its borders with pakistan, tsedenbal and chou en-lai signed a
treaty fixing the 2,500-mile frontier between their two countries . it
was another little lesson aimed at delhi . at the farewell banquet for

with burma, nepal, pakistan and outer mongolia, making the point that
only two neighbors now remain with whom china has not made a border

with mary, the queen mother . the talks roused little interest at the
time, and were soon overshadowed by the melodrama of edward's
abdication in order to marry " the woman i love " the twice-divorced
american socialite, wallis warfield simpson . since then, the duke and
duchess of windsor, growing paler and frailer with the passage of
years, have drifted from portugal to the west indies, from manhattan to
paris . their pastimes have been the trifling ones of showing up at

long-forgotten chats of the duke of coburg were making headlines in
london newspapers as the german aristocrat was also revealed as a
special emissary sent by hitler to britain because of his familial
connections with the royal family . the revelations appeared in the
latest batch of captured nazi documents published jointly last week by
the british, french and u.s . governments . coburg's " strictly
confidential " report was addressed " only for the fuhrer and party
member v . ribbentrop (no copy), " and said of edward viii that " for
him a german-british alliance is an urgent necessity and a guiding
principle of british foreign policy . " coburg eagerly suggested that
discussions about future relations be held between hitler and britain's
prime minister stanley baldwin . the king, said coburg, " replied in
the following words : " who is king here, baldwin or i ? i, myself,
wish to talk to hitler and will do so here or in germany . tell him
that, please . " britain's interests . the charge of progerman
sympathies has often been made against the german-descended duke of
windsor, most notably after the publication of other captured nazi
documents five years ago . the london daily express dismissed the late
duke of coburg's account as having no value as evidence because " he
was a nazi, spreading news he knew would be welcome in berlin . " but
the daily mirror's columnist cassandra seemed convinced of windsor's "
close and cordial relationships with the nazi regime . " at week's end
the duke of windsor, now 68, denied most but not all of the published
reports . " they give a generally false impression, " he declared in a
statement issued by his secretary in france, adding : " it must be

cement worker albert verbrugghe was driving his wife and another woman
down a quiet street in the copper town of jadotville one day last week,
when he suddenly heard the clatter of gunfire . pulling the triggers
for no apparent reason were nervous indian troops of the advancing
united nations force . verbrugghe slammed his little volkswagen to a
halt . his wife was already dead, the other woman dying . with an
anguished scream, verbrugghe stumbled out, blood streaming from a wound
under his eye . " my wife is killed, " he cried . " why, why, why ? "
the same question, in a larger context, was being asked in many
capitals last week . for the third time in 15 months, the world was
horrified witness to the spectacle of foreign soldiers, aided by the
u.s., seizing the towns and firing on native soldiers of the congo . to
many, the u.n.'s very presence in the african land was of doubtful
wisdom . but in any case, the blazing guns and swooping planes of the
u.n . hardly fitted the pacifying intent of its original congo mandate
. " it is an unspeakable tragedy, " said connecticut's democratic
senator thomas dodd, " that the world organization which was set up to
prevent war and preserve the peace should be starting wars . " in
london, 90 tory m.p.s accused the u.n . of acting " contrary to its own
charter . " even president kennedy, who last week ordered the u.s . to
begin shipping 2f-ton trucks, armored cars and transport planes to the
u.n . congo force, was reported to be alarmed at the disorder that
arose from the u.n . shooting . on to jadotville . but there was no
turning back on the basic decision that had been made . katanga's
secessionist president moise tshombe had used every sly trick in the
book to frustrate efforts to reunite his rebellious,
copperrich province with the rest of the congo . now, u.n .
secretary-general u thant, with u.s . encouragement, was determined to
end the katanga problem once and for all . the occasion happened to be
the collapse of discipline among tshombe's boozy, ragtag 20,000-man
gendarmerie . when they began shooting at u.n . soldiers in katanga a
fortnight ago, the u.n . replied with all the power at its command .
last week irish infantrymen marched into kipushi, site of copper mines
at the rhodesian border . ethiopian u.n troops already occupied
elisabethville itself . but the big prize was jadotville, a town of
90,000, where the giant union miniere mineral
outfit produces one-third of its copper (110,000 tons) and

south viet nam the helicopter war runs into trouble the
helicopter has revolutionized the ugly little anti-communist war in
south viet nam . using the whirlybirds for transport, government forces
no longer remain immobile in fixed outposts . they now go where the
viet cong goes . sometimes this is not very healthy, for the red
guerrillas have developed tactics to counter the copters . in the early
days, they tried to shoot them down with homemade shotguns and ancient
french rifles ; one helicopter even returned to base with an arrow
stuck in its fuselage . today, with more practice and an abundant
supply of captured u.s . weapons, the viet cong gangmen can make things
hot for the most skilled u.s . helicopter pilot . last week the viet
cong forces proved their prowess by shooting down five helicopters over
rice marshes southwest of saigon and inflicting a brutal defeat on the
government forces . like shooting ducks . the battle began as a routine
/ search and clear " operation in a red-infested area near the tiny
hamlet of apbac . the strike plan called for ten u.s . h-21
troop-carrying helicopters, escorted by five u.s . rocket-firing hu-1a
choppers, to ferry 400 government troops to the drop zone in waves of
100 men each . the first three groups landed with no ground fire from
the enemy . but as the fourth lift fluttered over the paddies, the
communists let loose with a blaze of bullets from the woods at the edge
of the rice field . " the tree line seemed to explode with machine-gun
fire, " said one helicopter pilot . " it was pure hell . " virtually
motionless, the banana-shaped helicopters were helpless targets at
point-blank range ; five of the hovering choppers were shot down, and
nine others were riddled by enemy fire . on the ground, the government
forces were pinned down in the hail of fire . " when those poor
vietnamese came out of the choppers, it was like shooting ducks for the
viet cong, " said one u.s . officer . the stunned survivors burrowed
into the slimy mud of the paddies and stayed there, refusing to
continue the assault . desperately captain kenneth good, 32, a west
pointer from ewa beach, hawaii, sought to rally the vietnamese for a
counterattack, but he was stitched through the neck and chest by a
burst from a viet cong automatic rifle . the government troops stayed
put . after eight hours of continuous bombardment, reinforcements began
to arrive . blasting away with machine guns, government armored cars
repeatedly attacked the entrenched viet cong positions at the tree line
and along a canal bordering the paddies ; each time they were driven
back . overhead, government planes pounded the viet cong with bombs and
napalm, but the communists did not break . " my god, we got a fix on
one machine-gun position and made 15 aerial runs on it, " said a u.s .
adviser . " every time we thought we had him, and every time that
damned gunner came right back up, firing . " the open wallet . as dusk
fell, the viet cong slipped into sampans and escaped down the darkened
canal with their dead and wounded . " everything we did went wrong, "
complained a u.s . adviser . a battalion of government paratroopers,
assigned the job of blocking the reds' escape route, was airdropped
into the wrong position . and when government artillery at last started
to shell the wooded viet cong positions, their rounds were zeroed in on
their own troops, killed three of their own men . worst of all, the
battered vietnamese troops showed little interest in pursuing the reds
. instead, they sloshed through the paddyfields, picking up their
casualties 68 dead and 100 wounded and poking through the downed
helicopters . on the cabin floor of one of the choppers lay the wallet
of a dead u.s . adviser open to a picture of his wife and child . in
all, three u.s . advisers captain good, sergeant william deal of mays
landing, n.j., and specialist 4 donald braman of radcliff, ky . were
killed in the ambush, and six more wounded . the dead brought to 56 the
number of u.s . troops killed so far in south viet nam . piecemealed to
death . the extent of the government defeat under conditions of its own
choosing and the heavy losses suffered by the u.s . helicopters caused
heads to snap from saigon to washington . under orders from president
kennedy, the pentagon began to investigate ways in which the choppers
can be better protected . in saigon, u.s . advisers admitted that the
day was a " miserable performance, " blamed the defeat on a " lack of
aggressiveness " by government troops . " they moved in slowly and gave
the viet cong a chance to piecemeal them to death, " said one american
officer . still, u.s . advisers are pleased with the progress made by
government troops over the past year . " casualties are inevitable when
you are fighting a war, " said one . " the viet cong are improving
their arsenal and techniques . we're doing the same and on balance
we're still way out ahead of them .

spain more news, more money spaniards who tuned in on news
broadcasts last week got the surprise of a quarter-century . since
francisco franco installed himself as spain's dictator in 1938, every
newscast had unfailingly ended with a ponderous salute to his falangist
party and a martial rendition of the falangist anthem . last week, for
the first time, news bulletins ended instead with a pleasant feminine
voice bidding senores y senoras good day, followed by a few bars of a
catch paso doble . in slow-moving spain, change of any kind is rare and
reluctant . yet, almost imperceptibly the regime is beginning to relax
its iron grip on society . since his appointment as franco's
information minister last july, manuel fraga iribarne, 40, has boosted
the daily ration of radio news from four to 18 broadcasts a day and for
the first time allowed spanish listeners a comparatively broad sampling
of world events . tale of pasionaria . press censorship also has
mellowed markedly . newspapers are no longer given the old-style daily
instrucciones that laid down what stories they could run and even
dictated how they should be laid out . though the country's biggest
dailies in madrid and barcelona are still subject to censorship, only
15 stories have been doctored by government officials since fraga took
over, and no foreign publications have been seized for political
reasons. in other cities, papers no longer are required to show galley
proofs to the censors before going to press . one weekly is actually
serializing the memoirs of dolores ibarruri, the fabled la pasionaria
of civil war days, who is queen bee of spain's exiled communist party
; her very name until recently was taboo in the spanish press . of the
eight prominent intellectuals arrested last year after denouncing
franco at a munich conference, five have been pardoned and the rest
allowed to go into voluntary exile . franco's uniformed state police,
once everywhere, is now less obvious, less arrogant . gift for
one-fifth . franco's decision to end spain's long cultural and
political isolation is based on his twofold conviction that 1) the
populace as a whole now accepts his regime, and 2) spain cannot survive
economically if it is excluded from the european common market, whose
members bitterly dislike his autocratic ways . the stubborn illegal
strikes that crippled spain's economy for two months last year also
forced el caudillo to recognize that the country's hardpressed workers
are desperately eager to enjoy living standards comparable to those of
other europeans . as a gift to the hopelessly poor unskilled laborers
who make up one-fifth of the work force, franco last week announced an
increase in the minimum wage that will almost double their takehome pay
and fringe benefits (to $1.66 a day) . spain, said franco, in a
year-end tv and radio address, is now " a nation of peace, on the road
to economic recuperation, with a capacity for growth in all sectors of
its life, and with a youth that is technically prepared and eager to
face the future . time alone was banned or seized 54 times in
eleven years by fraga's predecessor .

new crises, " a bit of doubletalk about berlin that could fit any

help us ! " slam out of the swirling snow of a moscow winter
morning last week, 32 shabby peasants suddenly appeared at the iron
gates of the u.s . embassy at 19-21 tchaikovsky street, brushed past
the russian guards on the sidewalk, and strode inside . to
flabbergasted american diplomats they put a startling request : help
us get out of russia . the six men, twelve women and 14 children clad
in tattered sheepskin coats and babushkas were a forlorn lot with a
forlorn tale . they came from a sect of protestant pentacostal
evangelists in the siberian town of chernogorsk, near the mongolian
border 2,100 miles to the east . of late, local authorities there had
taken away several children of the sect, and threatened to imprison the
adult faithful . with the vague notion that a foreign embassy might
help them, the siberians went by train to moscow . now they wanted to
travel to " israel " probably meaning the israel of the old testament .
the americans listened sympathetically, but ambassador foy kohler had
to stick to regulations. out went a call to the soviet foreign
ministry, explaining the situation and asking that the peasants be
removed . meanwhile, the siberians were invited into the embassy
lunchroom to have coffee and cake . embarrassed by the whole thing, the
u.s . officials prevented foreign correspondents from photographing or
speaking with the visitors . at last, a dilapidated bus drove into the
embassy compound and backed up to the lunchroom door . with it came
soviet foreign ministry agents, who urged the peasants to come along
quietly . " come now, let's not have a demonstration, " said one . "
where will you take us ? " a siberian inquired . " to a hotel, "
replied the official . " then we will arrange for you to go back home .
/ by then, the women were wailing . one peasant yelled, " but i do not
want to go back ! they will arrest me and shoot me ! " to a cluster
of newsmen standing near by, he cried, " we ask all brothers and
sisters who believe in god : help us ! help us ! " then the bus
drove away into the snow . the state department later explained
that it is u.s . policy,
as a rule, to deny asylum to foreigners in embassies abroad unless the
person is in " imminent danger from mob violence . " josef cardinal
mindszenty, roman catholic primate of hungary, was considered to
qualify " under exceptional circumstances " when he won sanctuary in

red china the chilly season red china's masses last week had
much in common with the subjects of the famous fairy-tale emperor :
everybody was talking about new clothes, but nobody could actually see
them . after three years of bad cotton crops, the annual cloth ration
has shrunk to as little as 2f ft . per person in some regions " just
enough, " said one refugee, " to patch our rags . " so severe is the
shortage, according to the official peking people's daily, that "
clothes hospitals " are making " short-sleeved shirts out of
long-sleeved shirts, a vest out of a short-sleeved shirt, and underwear
out of a vest . " in timeworn style, communist party chairman mao
tse-tung's lieutenants blame drought, hailstorms and insect blights for
cutting the ration from a manageable 20.65 ft . in 1957 to its present
handkerchief size . but red china's frayed look also owes much to a
deliberate decision by its leaders . " when the bad crops began in
1959, " explains one western expert in hong kong, " cotton and cloth
was one place where you could squeeze the people . " peking squeezed
hard, cutting back cotton acreage at least 20 per cent so that every
spare clod of earth could be sown to grains . the result : china's
1962 grain harvest was up 10 per cent to 182 million metric tons, while
the cotton crop may have fallen to as low as 1,200,000 metric tons,
down one-third from 1958 . further aggravating the situation at home,
peking sold huge amounts of cotton abroad to bring in badly needed
foreign exchange . with the onset of the chilly season, even the cloth
wrapping on gift parcels from relatives abroad is used to patch
threadbare garments . said one refugee in hong kong : " we are used to

adventure of invading the mainland . " to back up the story, communist
newspapers splashed front-page pictures of the captured agents and
their stockpiles of u.s . rifles, grenades, and plastic demolition
equipment . the story might have been brushed aside as another
propaganda tidbit, but the official nationalist central news agency

great britain the fateful weeks to
celebrate his sixth full year in office the longest term for a tory
since 1902 prime minister harold macmillan went before the cameras for
a television interview last week . it was a masterful performance .
relaxed and confident, macmillan talked with easy confidence of the
promise and problems of britain today . off-camera, things were not
going so well as harold macmillan made it seem . britain's hopes of
membership in the common market hung precariously in the balance .
after the decisions at nassau, a question mark rose over the future of
its military power . the latest gallup poll showed labor leading the
tories 45 per cent to 36 per cent . many of macmillan's own
conservative party backbenchers were critical of the government for its
inability to stop the growing unemployment in britain's north .
reason for confidence . seeking a solution to the problem of
jobs, macmillan last week gave lord hailsham a new ministerial task of
studying the northeast depressed areas, and told birmingham businessmen
that " with a little bit of luck " the economic slump might be reversed
this year . as another weapon against political decline, macmillan is
clearly counting on admission to the common market despite the
overwhelming obstacles ahead . on tv he said : " i believe that as
soon as the common market is settled, and as soon as it is clear that
there will not be another socialist government, you will find the
businessmen reinvesting on a bigger scale than ever before . that is
why i am confident about 1963 . " a decision on common market entry may
be imminent . this week britain's chief negotiator edward heath returns
to brussels for a crucial round of negotiations with europe's six the "
crunch " talks in which britain will have to agree to . when lord
salisbury resigned after a seven year term .
dismantle its own elaborate system or persuade
the europeans to ease their
terms for entry . seeking support . in preparation for the brussels
meeting, ted heath went to chequers, macmillan's ministerial estate,
spent hours urging his views on west germany's visiting foreign
minister gerhard schroder, a considerable sympathizer . then heath
crossed to the continent to line up additional support for britain's
position . he talked with belgium's deputy foreign minister henri
fayat, who wants britain in the common market, and with france's
foreign minister maurice couve de murville, who faithfully echoed de
gaulle's reluctance to lower the bars for britain . macmillan himself
will continue the task on his feb . 1 visit to rome for meetings with
italy's prime minister amintore fanfani, due this week in washington .
as fate would have it, the tories won relief of sorts from the drumfire
of criticism at home through a tragic happenstance in the labor party .
hugh gaitskell, labor's capable, hard-working leader, was rushed to
london's middlesex hospital suffering from pneumonia, double pleurisy
and severe periocarditis . in great pain and scarcely able to breathe,
gaitskell was allowed no visitors except his wife . snap pressure .
labor spokesmen officially spread the news that gaitskell would be back
at work within five to six weeks, but medical men thought three to six
months more likely . this means he will not be able to lead labor's
attack on britain's common market entry . in fact, to labor's acute
embarrassment, the man who becomes spokesman in gaitskell's place is
deputy leader george brown, who is as pro-common market as gaitskell as
anti . the conservative sunday telegraph paid tribute to gaitskell by
suggesting that " without him, there can be no
alternative government worth the name . " some tories promptly urged
macmillan to call a snap general election while labor is virtually
leaderless . but macmillan will almost certainly resist the pressure,
select his own time between now and october 1964, the date by which a
general election must be held . if, during the " crunch " of the next
few weeks in brussels, britain is admitted to the common market on an
approximation of its own terms, and if the straitened economy revives
as a consequence, the government would be in an excellent position for
a general election in the fall . macmillan, who will be 69 next month,
said during his tv interview that he thought he could put in another
six years on the job, and added jokingly : " the question is
whether the people could stand another six . " the answer
may be learned during the coming fateful weeks in brussels .

nikita khrushchev touched off a general crackdown on modern art (time,
dec . 14), several hundred soviet artists and writers were abruptly
summoned to the modern, glass-walled reception palace at lenin hills,
on the outskirts of moscow . khrushchev himself, it seemed, wanted to
hear what poets and painters thought of the party line on avant-garde
art . the argument raged for five hours, far into the night, and
included several remarkably frank exchanges with the soviet ruler . one
of the first to speak up was aging journalist-propagandist ilya
ehrenburg, 71 . defending a cezanne-like blue and purple canvas called
female nude, done by russian painter robert falk in 1922, which art
critic khrushchev had derided, ehrenburg said : " you and i, nikita
sergeevich, are getting on and haven't got much time left . but falk's
painting will live as long as there are lovers of beauty . " next,
abstract sculptor ernst neizvesnty, whose work also had been attacked
by nikita, took the floor . " you may not like my work, comrade
khrushchev, " the sculptor said, " but it has the warm admiration of
such eminent soviet scientists as kapitsa and landau . " retorted
khrushchev scornfully : " that's not why we admire kapitsa and landau
. " neizvesnty fell silent, but official kremlin poet evgeny evtushenko
rose to his friend's defense . " he came back from the war with 14
bullets in his body, " said evtushenko, " and i hope he will live many
more years and produce many more fine works of art " as people say, "
shot back nikita brutally, " only the grave corrects a hunchback . "
evtushenko managed a brave reply : " i hope, comrade khrushchev, we
have outlived the time when the grave was used as a means of correction
. " the audience was stunned, then burst into applause ; even
khrushchev sheepishly joined in . evtushenko's display of courage did
not last long . two weeks after the lenin hills meeting, the party's
ideological boss, leonid ilyichev, called in the poet and a number of
other young intellectuals for an attitude talk . ilyichev was
especially angry over evtushenko's poem babi yar, which condemned
soviet anti-semitism and which had just been enthusiastically received
in a new symphonic setting by composer dmitry shostakovich . cultural
commissars quickly canceled further performances of the symphony . as
for the poem, said ilyichev, it should be changed to include an attack
on west germany . after a sleepless night, evtushenko agreed to "

italy adjusting the apertura ever since premier amintore
fanfani teamed up with pietro nenni's socialists almost a year ago to
form italy's apertura a sinistra ( " opening to the left " ), the
uneasy alliance has been clouded by a single issue : nenni's demand
for the creation of 15 regional administrations that he figures will
boost his party's grass-roots support . fanfani agreed to pay nenni's
price because he needed the socialists' 88 votes in the chamber of
deputies in order to stay in power, but he stalled on enacting the
scheme just the same . fanfani feared that the socialists would sign
local electoral agreements with communists and thereby convert the new
regions into leftist strongholds . even after nenni pledged not to
cooperate with the reds, many of fanfani's christian democrats remained
skeptical of his promise . with nenni demanding quick action on the
regional plan, the looming alternative was compromise or collapse of
the coalition . last week fanfani acted . after nine hours of argument,
christian democrats and their two smaller coalition partners agreed to
introduce promptly two bills covering taxation and administration of
the regions ; they postponed legislation actually creating them until
a new parliament convenes after national elections in may . the
socialists grumbled bitterly, but nenni urged them to bide their time .
/ if there's going to be a government crisis, " he told a meeting of
his party's central committee, " it's not going to be caused by us . "
nenni has his eye on a cabinet post in a new government ; causing a
crisis at the moment would be irresponsible, for fanfani this week goes
off to visit john f . kennedy, and in a fortnight harold macmillan
arrives in rome . fellow travelers in the socialist high command were
willing, even anxious, to topple the government, but as the party
continued its talks at week's end, it appeared that nenni and the

the allies a problem of pipe to pump its burgeoning oil and gas
production from new fields in the caucasus and urals, russia has
undertaken a 38,000-mile pipeline network, with two main legs : one
westward from kuibyshev near the urals to power the factories of
russia's european satellites, the other thousands of miles through
siberia and on to the pacific . trouble is, russia cannot produce all
of the big-bore (up to 40 in.) pipe itself ; so it has turned to
capitalist manufacturers, mostly in west germany and italy, for 40 per
cent of the 2,500,000 tons of pipe it needs for the project . arguing

the congo the india-rubber man just after sunup one day last week,
secessionist moise tshombe slipped out of his pink palace in
elisabethville, climbed into the back seat of a black comet sedan, and
sped off down the road toward the northern rhodesian border . soon an
armored column of 500 united nations troops was on his tail . for a
moment, it looked as if the u.n . were in hot pursuit of its old foe .
but no ! to the astonishment of bug-eyed natives along the way, moise
was actually leading the blue helmets, urging his own tattered
katangese gendarmes to lay down their arms so the u.n . could reopen
vital rail and road links . bizarre as it was, the incident was an
accurate indicator of the way things actually were going last week in
the congo's copper-rich katanga province, where the u.n . was waging
war with tshombe's breakaway regime for the third time since september
1961 . in two weeks, the tough u.n . troops had seized a steadily
lengthening ribbon of rail lines and nearly every major population
center in the province . only the western copper town of kolwezi
remained in katanga's grip ; it was defended by 2,000 boozy gendarmes,
100 of tshombe's white mercenaries, and a smashing blonde ambulance
driver known as " madame yvette, " who sauntered about in paratroop
boots, camouflage uniform, bush hat and shoulder holster . only 50
miles from kolwezi, indian infantrymen probed cautiously forward,
waiting only for the signal to head full blast toward the town . but
the signal would not be given rashly, for the ragtag mercenaries
threatened to blow up a huge dam and industrial installations, leaving
the town a blackened shell . they might not be bluffing . " i am back .
/ but with full backing from the u.s . and the afro-asian nations, the
u.n . was determined to dictate a
settlement to tshombe and make it stick . if
it fails, the rest of the congo, starved of the riches that enable
katanga to account for 65 per cent of the country's exports, could
splinter into a score of warring tribal domains . already a corps of
100 central government functionaries was flying into elisabethville to
take charge of katanga's administration . the big question mark, as
usual, was the slippery tshombe . as the week began, he was holed up
defiantly in kolwezi with the mercenaries . there were rumors that he
might flee to europe rather than give in to the u.n . but he was not
surrendering katanga's top job . lo and behold, he was back in
elisabethville . " in spite of all the trouble and bloodshed, " he
declared with macarthurian grandeur, " i am back . " what policy would
he follow ? no one could say, for before long he was bouncing wildly
from one position to another . " pure india rubber, " marveled a
foreign diplomat . lump of sugar . in the space of three days, tshombe
1) promised to " abstain from making any declarations against the u.n .
/ ; 2) immediately broke his promise by threatening " a scorched-earth
policy " in kolwezi (see world business) ; 3) was clapped under house
arrest by infuriated u.n . officials " to restrain him from further
irresponsible acts " ; and 4) got his house arrest commuted to a
nighttime curfew by leading the u.n . troops to the rhodesian border .
then, having baffled everybody, he vanished once more from the capital.
with tshombe's katanga now largely under u.n . control, central
government premier cyrille adoula began flexing his muscles in
leopoldville . he demanded
that the british and belgian
consuls in elisabethville leave the country because they had acted as
mediators for tshombe in hopes of arranging a cease-fire . he spurned a
$2,000,000 gift from the british government because of its " subversive
policy " on katanga, and one of his officials sniffed : " we are not a
little child who can be given a lump of sugar to keep quiet . " box
score . exuberant as adoula was over tshombe's plight, there was not
much for him to crow about . even if katanga is successfully
reintegrated, he will still face the equally formidable problems of
administrative incompetence, official corruption, army indiscipline and
worst of all rivalries among the congo's 200 tribes . the point was
underlined in blood last week in kasai province, where feuding
tribesmen were at one another's throats over a border dispute . natives
kidnaped and reportedly ate two belgian lumbermen, then began
slaughtering one another in the town of kakenge . such gruesome
incidents no longer surprised anyone . a leopoldville newspaper
reported the event as matter-of-factly as if it were a baseball box
score . its headline : killed at kakenge 370 luluas, two belgians, one
musonge, one kanyoka .

right . like de gaulle he chose the device of a popular referendum when
he decided to adopt a constitution (time, dec . 28) ; his smashing
victory won hassan the rare esteem of his idol in paris . employing
some gaullist firmness, hassan has now fired the three members of his
cabinet who represented the powerful istiqlal party, filled their jobs
with officials stoutly loyal to the throne . since istiqlal was the
party largely responsible for organizing hassan's successful
referendum, there were those who thought hassan was a bit ungrateful .
but istiqlal leaders were pressing for close economic and diplomatic
ties with cairo, based on a common islamic heritage, and demanding that
hassan pursue morocco's claims to spanish sahara, mauritania and part
of algeria's sahara . refusing to salaam to gamal abdel nasser, king
hassan resisted, arguing that the nation's future lies less with the
arab world than with france and europe's common market . he also
opposed the nationalists' agitation on the border claims . said
hassan's closest political confidant, cabinet director ahmed reda
guedira, after the purge : " the king had to get rid of the grains of
sand which always kept the state machinery out of order . . . the
leaders and platforms of the old parties are stale, like empty
eggshells . " it was gaullist rhetoric, and it hinted of still another
gaullist touch . rabat buzzed with rumors that hassan was ready to
organize his own political machine . according to one report, the name

mali where the twain meet at the post office in timbuctoo, a
clerk put aside his french translation of a soviet novel extolling the
red army, genially affixed a mali stamp commemorating telstar onto a
postcard . " we get lots of americans through here, " he mused to a
visitor from the u.s . there are many other visitors too . mali, whose
fabled sahara ghost town of timbuctoo is the national attraction, has
become a magnet for russians, french, communist chinese, east germans,
west germans, bulgarians, hungarians and many other breeds of
foreigners . from most of them, mali accepts assistance . " one does
not tell a man who is drowning to choose the branch or the plank he
will catch hold of, " mali's towering (6 ft . 4 in.) president modibo
keita explains . since mali's 1960 breakaway from france and the
rupture of its short-lived federation with senegal, keita has been
reaching for help in a fashion that few dark continent leaders manage
to duplicate . today mali receives aid from no fewer than 13 nations on
both sides of the iron curtain . trucks & paddies . to mali's backwater
capital of bamako, the u.s . anted up $2,500,000 a year . west germany
is supplying 325 trucks on $4,900,000 credit . the common maket
nations, as a group, have financed 19 mali projects worth $17 million .
ex-mother france pours in the biggest amount, $9,000,000 a year, and
also provides 400 technicians, including 180 schoolteachers . the
communist bloc, for its part, has opened a line of credit worth $100
million, and has 500 technicians on the spot . russians have put up
neon street lights in bamako, are erecting an expensive sports stadium.
fraternizing french and czech pilots help run the government's motley
air mali fleet of six russian-built ilyushins and three vintage,
u.s.-made dc-3s . bulgarians, among other things, are developing
truck-farming colonies, while such distant types as red chinese and
north vietnamese have taught malians how to operate rice paddies . a
certain indecision . for all its cooks, impoverished mali is brewing
precious little progress . the chief reason is that, while talking
neutralism abroad, at home keita and his union soudanaise party run a
sloppy little marxist-style land that is deep in financial trouble . in
line with his goal of " an economy based on socialist principles, "
keita has built up one money-devouring state enterprise after another .
there is the airline, now in debt to the tune of $3,000,000 ; there is
the state trading company, currently in the red $3,200,000 ; and, of
course, a chain of subsidized " people's shops . " six months ago,
egged on by the communists, keita suddenly brought out a proud new mali
franc to replace the french african franc it had been using . owing to
mali's near bankruptcy, it was unfortunately nonconvertible . since few
foreigners would accept it, the money (printed in czechoslovakia)
promptly wiped out 85 per cent of normal imports, whose duties had
provided the bulk of government revenue . deprived of their goods, mali
merchants went on a rioting rampage in bamako and sacked the police
station ; two demonstrators were killed, and a " people's tribunal "
in bamako sentenced 77 others to prison at hard labor . by last week
more than 50 of mali's 250 most important foreign enterprises, mostly
french, had pulled out . the trade deficit stood at $26 million and
reserves had shrunk to a minuscule $5,000,000 . in paris the french
listened with almost saintly patience to mali's pleas for a massive
bail-out loan ; when all is said and done, france is expected to come
across with the cash . as an exporter of peanuts and beef (its cattle
are north of africa's tsetse fly zone), self-sufficient in rice and
other staples, mali just might make the grade, despite the marxist
trappings . in any case, modibo keita, like many another african
leader, is still open to suggestion on which ideology is best .

of communist viet cong guerrillas beheaded a government provincial
district chief northwest of saigon, and another knocked over a

south viet nam rice & rats one day last july sergeant first
class roque matagulay, 31, a guam-born u.s . military adviser with a
vietnamese detachment, ventured out of his compound near the coastal
town of phanthiet, 90 miles east of saigon, on an off-duty hunting trip.
instead of game, sergeant matagulay ran into a band of communist viet
cong guerrillas, was held captive until his release last month . last
week, in his first press conference since he was freed, matagulay
depicted the spartan life and grim dedication of the viet cong .
matagulay said that the viet cong moved freely over the countryside and
that in the villages peasants freely offered rebels food and shelter .
the typical menu for both prisoner and captors was rice, salt and fish
oil . rats were an occasional delicacy that brightened the diet served
both as rat soup and barbecued rodent . though game was plentiful, the
reds never hunted . " they were afraid to use up ammunition hunting
deer, " said matagulay . for the first several months of his captivity,
matagulay was tied up and constantly reminded that he would be killed
on the spot if he made the slightest effort to escape . he underwent no
physical torture, instead was daily subjected to eight solid hours of
political indoctrination and interrogation . matagulay was forced to
listen to the english-language broadcasts on communist north viet nam's
radio hanoi three times a day and was regularly tested on what they had
to say about the world situation . obviously because madagulay is a
darkskinned guamanian, his interrogators harped on the plight of the
negroes in the u.s . south . again and again, he refused to sign
anti-american propaganda documents, but finally, wracked with malaria
and with his weight down from 185 to 145, he signed four statements, "
when i believed i was at the end of my physical endurance . " the
documents, which matagulay later had to read aloud so that the viet
cong could record them on tape, bitterly attacked south viet nam's
president ngo dinh diem and the u.s.'s support for his government .
last month, to cheer matagulay up, the communists said that they were
fixing him a special christmas dinner . he never got it . on christmas
eve the reds held a release ceremony, invited 400 soldiers, peasants,
women and children to witness a last act of generosity to their
prisoner . matagulay then was put on a bus and sent back to freedom .

where there is an excess of ceremony, there is sure to be deceit . " in

bandaranaike, sniffed incense, was wined and dined by premier chou
en-lai, and was even taken to see a relic of buddha's tooth . reason
for the indulgent treatment was the set of proposals that mrs .
bandaranaike brought to peking as spokesman for the six nonaligned
nations ghana, egypt, indonesia, burma, cambodia and ceylon who met in
colombo last month and took it upon themselves to arbitrate the bloody
himalayan border dispute between china and india . the neutrals'
solution delighted the chinese, for it set up a demilitarized zone
along the himalayan frontier and actually gave red china more territory
in india than it had occupied before its sudden invasion last october .
expecting at least a token condemnation of chinese aggression from its
old neutralist cronies, india was, to say the least, disappointed . in
new delhi, prime minister jawaharlal nehru received mrs . bandaranaike
coolly after her ten-day sojourn in china, but did not reject her
proposals outright . nehru still hopes to gain time to build up his

great britain the shock of today (see cover)
the signs and symbols of prosperity are everywhere in britain, crowding
the past, complicating the present . along rolling roman roads and
winding country lanes, past sleeping norman churches and whitewashed
farms, weekend traffic flows like an invading army . london's raw new
office buildings jostle georgian mansions ; a hilton hotel stares
impertinently down onto buckingham palace . bowling alleys and dance
halls are packed each night of the week . on city rooftops, tv antennas
stand as thick as the english archers at agincourt . in one decade, the
number of cars on the roads has doubled (to 6,000,000), though the
entire island boasts only 190 miles of expressway . most britons earn
twice as much as they did in 1949, and they are gambling and betting
their lolly at the stupefying rate of $3 billion a year . one of
london's most exquisite 18th century houses opened recently as an
opulent gambling club . in the past two years, bingo palaces and
betting shops have mushroomed throughout the country, which some now
call " the windfall state . " these days, more than 3,500,000 " insular
/ britons go abroad each year mostly to the continent, where darts and
marmalade and tea at 4 : 30 are now an accepted part of the rites of
summer . britons are better educated and in better health than ever
before and need pay no doctors' bills . yet, for all their heady new
affluence, the british today feel disturbed and insecure . their
troubled mood is indefinable but inescapable . it is a sense of unease
in which is blended the awareness of national decline, the conscious
sense of failure to find new outlets for their energies, a feeling that
many of their hallowed institutions and traditions are increasingly
irrelevant to a formidably changed world . two rings . the nation's
commerce and industry, its education and ethics, were all developed to
meet the challenge of global power . its history books and literature
reverberate with the names of soldier-heroes and the battlefields on
which they won and held an empire : omdurman and lucknow, quebec,
khartoum, mafeking . in every corner of their island, statues and
street names still celebrate a glory that has passed . " you used to
open the atlas, " muses a manchester businessman, " and half the world
was red . now britain is just a little red speck off the coast of
europe . " suez cruelly demonstrated to the world that it takes power
to be a power . but even then, britons could not come to terms with the
harsh reality of vanished might . their feeling of shock today is all
the greater because it has been so long delayed . as if by some
malevolent design, a whole series of frustrations and failures has
beset britannia in a few short months, deepening the nation's angst .
the abrupt u.s . cancellation of the skybolt missile rudely exposed the
fact that britain's " independent " nuclear deterrent is in fact almost
wholly dependent on washington . there was a time when u.s . presidents
sought britain's counsel and even approval before taking any major
initiative in world affairs ; in the cuban crisis, the most perilous
of the last few years, the celebrated jack-mac telephone rang just
twice . back on the dole . britain's insecurity has been exacerbated by
14 long months of haggling with the europeans . swallowing their pride
and reversing centuriesold tradition, the british decided in mid1961 to
cross the channel and make common cause with the continent . then last
week, just as they were within sight of their goal, charles de gaulle
of france contemptuously closed the door on perfidious albion . even at
home, the storm signals were flying . once again the lines of
unemployed workers are lengthening outside labor exchanges . the
half-forgotten word " dole " is back in the language . britain's
overall unemployment rate of 2.6 per cent , though mild by u.s .
standards, is at a four-year peak and still rising . moreover, most of
the 600,000 men without jobs are concentrated in a few dozen " black
spots " in the north, where in some communities up to 14 per per cent
of the work force is on the dole ($13 a week for a married man) .
gap nonetheless, britain's prosperity is poised on a knife edge . in
the past decade, its economy has grown only 2fy per year on average ;
in 1962 it rose only 1 per cent , whereas in the common market even a 4
per cent growth rate is considered disappointing . since 1950,
balance-of-payments crises have brought britain to the brink of
bankruptcy six times . by draconian measures the government succeeded
last year in boosting exports 3 per cent for a new $11 billion postwar
record, helping to maintain gold and hard-currency reserves . however,
it was only able to achieve stability by cutting back credit and
curbing industrial expansion . " other countries have had their
economic miracles, " sighs a manchester journalist . " britain has had
its crises . " britain needed urgently to expand its markets and
broaden its shaky financial base . once inside europe, british industry
was confident that it could substantially boost exports to the six . it
also anticipated a heavy influx of investment capital from u.s . and
other foreign companies eager to have a british toehold in the common
market . if britain were finally excluded from europe, investment would
continue to dwindle and britain might be forced as a result to make
drastic cuts in its living standards . meanwhile, it may either retreat
behind high tariff walls or else return to its classic ideal of free
trade, possibly in association with the u.s . and european nations
outside the market . this week, as m.p.s flocked back to westminster
from the christmas recess, unemployment threatened to be an even more
explosive issue than the collapse of the common market negotiations .
the government's best asset in time of crisis has always been the prime
minister, a political machoudini who can slither out of almost any trap
by sheer sleight-of-hand . undisturbed by the country's mounting
frustration over unemployment and housing, macmillan did not swing into
action until last summer, after the tories had suffered the worst
series of by-election reverses inflicted on a british government in 40
years . in his third and most drastic cabinet reshuffle since he took
office, macmillan purged half his ministers, handed key posts to some
of the brightest young politicians east of the new frontier . to ginger
up the faltering economy, new chancellor of the exchequer reginald
maudling cut interest rates, gave generous new tax concessions to
industry, slashed purchase taxes on autos and a wide range of consumer
goods . to speed homebuilding and slum clearance a task that macmillan
himself discharged with distinction in his first cabinet post in 1951
the prime minister brought in sir keith joseph, 45, an astute
politician and onetime construction company executive, and gave him the
go-ahead for a major public-works program . geoffrey rippon, 38, the
party's " back-room " housing expert, was assigned to streamline
archaic building codes and techniques . two weeks ago, as unemployment
kept rising and support for the government slumped to an alltime low
(36 per cent v . 45 per cent for labor), macmillan assigned lord
hailsham, his minister of science and former party chairman, to make a
crash effort to help the worst depressed areas as cabinet minister
responsible for the northeast . the government does not have to call an
election for 21 months . it has recently seemed likely, however, that
macmillan would go to the people in the coming fall . by then,
politicians figured, britain would have made her triumphal entry into
the common market, and the government's pump priming would have thinned
the unemployment rolls and reinvigorated the economy . but after last
week's dimming of hopes for a prompt entry into europe, the government
may feel constrained to seek a new mandate even earlier . the
conservatives have been in power for eleven straight years, the longest
unbroken innings that any party has enjoyed since the 23-year tory
reign that ended in 1830 . sixteen by-election setbacks for the tories
in the past year have badly dented macmillan's prestige . until hugh
gaitskell's death last week, a tory defeat in the next elections seemed
at least a possibility . against a demoralized, leaderless opposition,
the conservative chances are far brighter for the fourth straight
electoral victory . some experts speculate that harold macmillan may
decide to step down after the election . he has no clear heir, but
deputy prime minister r . arab " ) butler, an astute tactician who is
distrusted by tory rightwingers, would succeed him if macmillan were
removed tomorrow .

togo death at the gate for sylvanus olympio, 60, president of
togo, the nightmare began shortly after midnight . disturbed by strange
sounds in his comfortable house in the capital city of lome, olympio
grabbed a pistol and went to the head of the stairs . there, to his
consternation, was a crowd of mutinous soldiers crowding the floor
below . barefoot, clad in shorts and sport shirt, olympio leaped
through a window onto the soft, sandy earth of his garden . he made it
to the u.s . embassy compound next door . in the graveled courtyard,
olympio found a parked plymouth sedan belonging to the embassy, and
crawled in . there, in the early morning sunlight, he was spotted
huddled beneath the steering wheel by one of the mutineers . crying "
all right, you have me .! " , olympio surrendered and, prodded by
rifle butts, was hustled down the driveway, past a mango tree and
through the green gate . there he balked . sergeant etienne eyadema,
commander of the rebel detachment, later declared : " he could not
stay there . there would have been demonstrations . he would not move .
i shot him . " at 7 that morning, u.s . ambassador leon poullada drove
up to the embassy building, found president olympio lying in a pool of
blood just outside the compound . there were red finger smears on the
gate, as if he had struggled to rise . as embassy aides carried the
corpse into the courtyard, fat lizards scuttled away across the gravel
and lounging togolese soldiers watched silently from a nearby street
corner . " blow to progress . " thus last week died the man who was
ruler of a postagestamp-sized republic (75 by 340 miles) on the
sweltering west african coast . chief architect of togo's 1960
independence from french control, london-educated olympio practiced
stern austerity at home, rejected demagoguery and sided openly with the
west . president kennedy, whom olympio visited in washington last
march, mourned his death as " a blow to the progress of stable
government in africa . " suspicion immediately focused on ghana's
strongman kwame nkrumah, who has conducted a bitter feud with olympio
over control of the powerful, 700,000member ewe (pronounced ev-vy)
tribe, which was split between both countries by european
boundary-setters . twice before, assassins had tried to kill olympio ;
each time ghana's agents were accused . but this time it was olympio's
own zealous economies that brought disaster . " bon . ca va . " as part
of his economic austerity program, olympio had stubbornly refused to
expand togo's flyspeck army beyond its standing strength of 250 men
exactly one company . this angered both the " army " and the
demobilized, hardeyed togolese veterans of french colonial wars, who
had fought from indo-china to algeria but could find no place in their
homeland's armed forces . recently, a tough ex-sergeant, emmanuel
bodjolle, 35, jobless and with a family to support, organized a
conspiracy with 30 other noncoms . last week, after olympio tore up a
final plea to take into the service at least 60 of the most qualified
veterans, bodjolle snapped : " bon . ca va . " that midnight his
battle-tough insurgents struck, easily occupying the capital .
olympio's successor is nicolas grunitzky, 49, his brother-in-law, who
was swept out of office as territorial premier for the french when
olympio took over five years ago . grunitzky's first act was to
announce that togo would align itself with the afro-malagasy union, the
pro-french association of west africa states . then he declared free
elections would soon follow . but, as so often happens in such
circumstances, he decided it would be best to dissolve parliament and
rule alone until things settled down .

last . it had been a 2f-year siege that brought the u.n . close to
bankruptcy, set the u.s . at odds with its principal european allies
and threatened to immerse central africa in blood . now, katanga's
rebel moise tshombe sat wanly behind a desk in a stucco cottage in the
copper town of kolwezi and declared, " i am ready to proclaim
immediately before the world that katanga's secession is ended . " the
words of the mercurial moise had a familiar ring, and there were
skeptics who suggested the pledge was false . " i'll believe it when i
see it, " said one diplomat in elisabethville . " we know the man, "
shrugged central government premier cyrille adoula in leopoldville . "
it is not the first time that tshombe has declared himself ready to
renounce his ambitions to found an independent state . " wise act . "
but this time tshombe had little choice . blue-helmeted u.n . troops
controlled nearly all the major rail and population centers of katanga
province, and u.n . secretary-general u thant was not backing down on
his threat to crush katanga's wily secessionist . up to the last
moment, tshombe wavered . having fled from elisabethville " a
frightened and dejected man, " in the words of british and belgian
officials, he turned up last week in kolwezi, where the last 3,000 of
his 20,000-man gendarmerie were holed up . a two-man peace mission
composed of jacques houard, belgium's consul general in salisbury,
southern rhodesia, and andre van roey, director of katanga's national
bank, followed him there . for 36 desperate hours, the two urged him to
yield rather than carry out his threat to blow up the huge dams and
copper and cobalt mines operated by the giant union miniere company in
kolwezi . finally, convinced that he had no alternative, tshombe gave
in . later, apparently to show newsmen what might have happened, he
drove them to a minor hydroelectric substation 70 miles outside
kolwezi, aimed a six-pound artillery piece at it and pulled the lanyard.
the shot was right on target . the substation, apparently loaded with
dynamite, disintegrated while tshombe guffawed . as a final act of
obstreperousness he had peacemaker houard thrown out of katanga
because, as foreign minister evariste kimba complained, " you have done
nothing for us . " but tshombe was beaten nonetheless . even his old
ally, sir roy welensky, prime minister of the rhodesias and nyasaland,
told him he had " acted wisely " in yielding . is everybody happy ?
the central government promised moise " a general and complete amnesty
/ for himself and his followers . with that, tshombe returned to
elisabethville to work out the procedures of his capitulation with u.n.
officials . he found that some of the details had already been taken
care of the blue-and-gold flag of the central government now fluttered
over the katangese defense ministry . sixty civil servants and 120
congolese army officers arrived from leopoldville to take over
katanga's military remnants and administer postal service,
telecommunications, customs and immigration . as resident minister,
leopoldville's top man in katanga would be slight, sober joseph ileo,
40, a moderate who served as interim premier of the congo after erratic
patrice lumumba was deposed in 1960 . the question now was whether
leopoldville's central government could keep katanga under control now
that it was won . if the mob violence back in leo itself was any
indication, u.n . troops would have to stay on in katanga for quite a
while . down leo's boulevard albert stormed 600 students and street
urchins, shouting " tshombe to the gallows ! " at the british
embassy, which is considered fair game because of london's friendly
policy toward katanga, the mob battered down the doors, sacked the
offices, and tried to pry off a coat of arms because, as one student
cried, " it's made of katanga copper .! " after an hour, the u.n.'s
congo chief robert gardiner arrived and scattered the mob . all the
while, a jeepload of adoula's cops sat chuckling near by, making no
move to stop pillage .

syria foiled again generally speaking, syria's soldiers are no
great shakes at fighting . but they're a persistent lot when it comes
to overthrowing the government at home . no fewer than ten attempted
coups have taken place in 13 years . one group of officers has plotted
steadily for more than two years . led by colonel abdel karim nahlawi,
39, the military malcontents were in on the coup that severed syria's
union with egypt . last march, they tried to take over the government,
but were packed off as military attaches in syrian embassies abroad .
last week the officers were up to their old tricks again . incensed by
a damascus decree stripping them of their army status, the group
arranged a dramatic rendezvous in turkey, then quietly crossed the
frontier and made for their old barracks inside syria . greeted
joyously by some of their former comrades in arms, nahlawi's men issued
a public demand that their discharges be canceled, and that a new
general staff to their liking be put in power . to confuse things, the
rebellious soldiers insisted on a plebiscite to decide on closer
relations with nasser's egypt . otherwise, nahlawi threatened, troops
under his control would march on damascus . for president nazem
el-koudsi, it was an old familiar tune . coolly, he played for time,
agreed to " consider " the demands if nahlawi would negotiate at army
headquarters . the talks dragged on for three crisis-filled days .
then, koudsi mobilized his own forces, one night suddenly surrounded
the army ghq with armored cars . colonel nahlawi got the point . in
another country, he and his men might have been jailed, or even
executed for treason . but koudsi, who keeps a prepared resignation in
his desk just in case the soldiers should some day win, chose not to
push his luck . escorted aboard an airliner and given $1,000 apiece to
cover their expenses, the rebels were sent back to diplomatic posts in
civvies .

south arabia

terrain, britain's aden colony on the southwestern fringe of the
arabian peninsula is one of the world's most unattractive pieces of
real estate . but it has its value nonetheless . between suez and
singapore, it is the only suitable fueling and victualing station for
the british navy, and 8,000 troops of her majesty's middle east command
are stationed on its 75 square miles of overheated rock . to strengthen
the precious little colony against the covetous desires of nearby
yemen, the british since 1959 have been linking neighboring sultanates
and emirates in a new federation of south arabia . aden was to join in
march, but an outburst of riots sparked by pro-yemen labor leaders and
the emergence of an egyptian backed nationalist regime in yemen itself
persuaded britain to speed things up . last week the british made aden
the twelfth member of the federation, retaining control but vaguely
promising eventual independence . arab nationalists were unhappy .
while the federation's black, yellow, green and blue flag went up over
government buildings in place of the union jack, anti-federation

tunisia pals no more one of the most perishable commodities in the
arab world seems to be gratitude . when algeria won independence from
france after seven years of bloody war, its people were deeply indebted
to neighboring tunisia, whose president habib bourguiba, 59, had given
shelter to 200,000 algerian refugees and provided a refuge for the
training and equipment of 18,000 algerian fighting men . but last week,
in a shouting, gesticulating speech in the vast casbah square of tunis,
bourguiba said it was " surprising " to discover that algeria has "
become a residence for criminals and plotters against the government of
tunisia . " he seemed mostly upset by the fact that algeria has refused
to extradite one boubeker mustafi, a tunisian accused of being party to
the christmas assassination plot against bourguiba (time, jan . 4), for
which 13 tunisians have been condemned to death . bourguiba ridiculed
46-year-old algerian premier ahmed ben bella as " an inexperienced,
excited youth, " and " a simple-minded peasant, " but conceded that "
not all members of the algerian government were involved . " in any
case, boasted bourguiba, " we have enough power and strength to face
any adversary . i don't intend to keep up hypocritical relations with
any government . " at week's end bourguiba made his displeasure
official by summoning home tunisia's ambassador to algeria . but there
was no break in diplomatic relations, nor any sign that tunisia's
10,000-man army was preparing to take on algeria's 120,000 veteran

cold war of bases & bombs at first glimpse, it certainly
bore all the signs of a u.s.-soviet deal . first the news broke that
premier khrushchev, in a secret letter to president kennedy, had agreed
to remove the biggest obstacle to a nuclear test-ban treaty by
permitting on-site inspections in russia . soon afterward, the u.s .
confirmed that it was preparing to dismantle its jupiter base in
turkey, the very thing that khrushchev had demanded when the u.s .
forced him to get his medium-range missiles out of cuba, and its bases
in italy, too . was there really a deal ? no . the two events have
really no connection . the khrushchev offer, while proof of his
continued mellowing, is negligible ; any test ban would depend on
conditions virtually impossible to fulfill now . as for the removal of
american missile installations from turkey and italy, its purpose, said
president kennedy, is simple to put the u.s . " in a stronger position
/ by substituting potent polaris submarines for the immobile,
vulnerable irbms, sitting ducks for soviet retaliation . solid v .
liquid . months before khrushchev suggested his cuba-for-turkey swap,
the joint chiefs had begun considering the phase-out of bases in
turkey, italy, and in england as well . the dismantling of the 60 thor
missiles in britain is to begin this spring . more than compensating
for their loss are eight polaris subs operating out of holy loch,
scotland, each toting 16 missiles . to replace the 15 jupiters in
turkey and the 30 in italy, the u.s . plans to deploy possibly six subs
in mediterranean waters . total firepower : 96 missiles, each with a
nuclear-tipped warhead packing the equivalent of 800,000 tons of tnt .
compared with jupiter's 1,500-mile reach, the current polaris missiles
have a range of 1,380 to 1,725 miles, and before long the subs will get
a-3 models with a 2,875mile range . though moscow is hard at work on
anti-sub devices, u.s . experts see no evidence that the russians have
come up with an effective defense against the fleet of 41 polaris subs
that will be at sea by 1967 . both turkey and italy swiftly accepted
the changeover . to provide berthing facilities for the subs, the u.s .
hopes to expand its naval base at rota on spain's atlantic coast .
question of boxes . the chance of a workable nuclear test-ban treaty
seemed equally remote . actually, khrushchev first agreed to the
principle of on-site inspections way back in 1959, when britain's prime
minister macmillan was in moscow, only to shelve it after he broke the
three-year test moratorium in 1961 . but having concluded his own
latest nuclear test series, khrushchev doubtless figures that he has
little to lose from an effort to stop all testing for a while . " the
time has come now, " khrushchev wrote kennedy just before christmas, "
to put an end once and for all to nuclear tests . we are ready to meet
you halfway . " to nikita, halfway meant two or three inspections each
year to investigate suspicious tremors ; the u.s . thought that eight
inspections would be the minimum, having whittled that down from its
original twelve . while the u.s . has been demanding that at least a
dozen unmanned seismic detection stations, or " black boxes, " be
installed on soviet soil, khrushchev said that three would do one each
in siberia's altai mountains, the virgin lands of soviet central asia
and the soviet far east . " we believe, " he concluded, " that now the
road to agreement is straight and clear . " atmospheric noise . this
was clearly not kennedy's view, but he declared himself " encouraged, "
suggested that exploratory talks be held and, after they got started,
ordered a halt to the current series of u.s . underground tests to
improve their chances of success . last week soviet u.n . ambassador
nikolai t . fedorenko and veteran geneva negotiator semyon k .
tsarapkin were closeted in washington with u.s . arms control and
disarmament agency chief william c . foster and british ambassador sir
david ormsby gore . there was no shortage of problems . in moscow, dour
foreign minister andrei gromyko declared, " france must sign, " fully
aware that de gaulle has no intention of joining a test ban . another
question was how to ring in red china, which is expected to explode an
a-bomb by year's end . since peking had not yet done so, gromyko said,
the problem was " artificial . " anxious to keep the talks going, u.s .
officials grasped at straws  and hopeful phrases .  " i don't think
this closes the door, " said one . " it's just atmospheric noise . "

great britain after hugh, who ? the death of hugh
gaitskell has left britain's opposition without a single figure who can
be counted on to unite the labor party behind him . worse yet, with
election talk in the air, laborites fear that no likely successor is of
sufficient stature to win immediate national acceptance as a potential
prime minister . the party is torn between two leading contenders who
personify the warring extremes within the party that took hugh
gaitskell seven turbulent years to pacify . top right-wing candidate is
deputy leader george brown, an earthy, onetime errand boy who
infuriates leftist intellectuals by addressing them as " brother . "
brown, 48, is a staunch anti-communist, a firm believer in the western
alliance, and, until gaitskell committed the party to an anti-european
line, was a vigorous advocate of british membership in the common
market . gutty, impulsive, often explosively gauche, brown has had
little formal education or top-level administrative experience, but is
a knowledgeable defense expert who criticized britain's commitment to
the skybolt missile as far back as 1960 . his most impressive
endorsement came last week from the prestigious economist, which argued
that criticisms of his quick temper and impatience with technical
detail " could also have been levied against winston churchill . "
unlike gaitskell, whose political philosophy was based on an
essentially out-of-date view of an " insular and downtrodden england, "
argued the weekly, brown's socialism is that " of an age when
intelligent thrusters have learned to look forward in opportunity . " /
little harold . " labor's left wing supports harold wilson, 46, an
adroit, urbane debater and topnotch intellect who was an oxford
economics don at 21 . as president of the board of trade in clement
attlee's cabinet, pipe-puffing yorkshireman wilson has had more
administrative experience than any of his rivals, is the party's
foreign policy specialist . despite his brilliance and charm, wilson's
foes, who call him " little harold, " regard him as a slippery
opportunist who backs only winning causes though he miscalculated in
1960 when he attempted to grab the leadership while gaitskell was
fighting for his political life against the party's powerful anti-nato
bloc . brown defeated wilson for the deputy leadership, 133 to 103,
last year . but this time brown has an added challenge : james
callaghan, 50, who also has strong middle-road and right-wing support .
a naval petty officer's son who would have been chancellor of the
exchequer in a gaitskell cabinet, " stoker " callaghan is a hard-boiled
debater and effective tv performer, but is regarded by many colleagues
as a lightweight . to prepare for the chancellorship, he has been
cramming with some of oxford's brightest young dons, who privately rate
him " b or b-plus . " he is an engaging, hard-working politician, and
many of brown's supporters fear that he may split the right-wing vote .
in a deadlock, he could even emerge as labor's leader . foe's woes .
the choice of an effective opposition leader has seldom seemed more
important to the labor party or to the nation particularly since
governmental power in britain has in recent years increasingly moved
from the commons and the cabinet into the hands of the prime minister .
admittedly, the likelihood of a labor prime minister in the near future
has been dimmed by gaitskell's death . on the other hand, the tories
have little immediate cause for confidence : on top of charles de
gaulle's brusque rejection of the government's bid for common market
membership, unemployment the most crucial issue in british politics
today has jumped an alarming 25 per cent in one month, reaching a
16-year record of 814,632 (partly due to layoffs in the bitter winter
weather) . labor's leader will probably not be chosen until
mid-february . laborites hoped that tory setbacks would give them time
to develop a winning personality who could keep their party united .

united nations man as an end in himself in the lobbies and
meeting halls of the united nations, u.s . ambassador adlai stevenson
often hears the argument of new nations that democracy is a luxury they
cannot afford . stevenson can make a good case to the contrary, as he
showed last week in an eloquent address in manhattan before the center
for the study of democratic institutions : " there is precious
little dignity or equality in our natural state . most human beings
have to spend their lives in utter vulnerability . all are born
unequal, in terms of capacity or strength . . . and survive only through
the restraint shown by more powerful neighbors . for nearly 3,000 years
/ western man' has struggled to create a social order in which weak,
fallible, obstinate, silly, magnificent man can exercise his free and
responsible choice . " whether democracy can prevail in the great
upheaval of our time is a valid question . we have good reason to know
how clumsy, slow, inefficient and costly it is compared to the
celerity, certainty and secrecy of absolutism . but the important thing
is that it has survived . the important thing is that even the
absolutists masquerade as democrats ; even the military and
quasi-military dictatorships strive in the name of democracy to manage
the public business . and all of them say that authoritarianism is only
a necessary transition to democracy . . . the enemies of freedom,
whatever the magnificent ends they propose the brotherhood of man, the
kingdom of saints, " from each according to his ability, to each
according to his needs' miss just this essential point : that man is
greater than the social purposes to which he can be put . he must not
be kicked about even with the most high-minded objectives . he is not a
means or an instrument . he is an end in himself . " this is the
essence of what we mean by democracy not so much voting systems or
parliamentary systems or economic or legal systems (though they all
enter in), as an irrevocable and final dedication to the dignity of man.
in this sense, democracy is perhaps mankind's most audacious
experiment .

hatter's outdoor tea party in wonderland . smack in the middle of a
mudfouled road at pumpi, 40 miles from secessionist moise tshombe's
last-ditch headquarters at kolwezi, united nations brigadier reginald
noronha set up four folding tables and laid out tea, peanutbutter
sandwiches, coffee and simba beer . at 9 a.m., right on schedule, four
katanga province officials and three representatives of the union
miniere mining outfit roared up in two autos . " we have come to meet
you as friends, " declared one, and the party was on . despite the
apparent absurdity of it, the pumpi tea party was a dead serious affair
arranged so that tshombe could peacefully escort united nations troops
into kolwezi, the last major objective in its drive to end katanga's
2f-year secession . typically, tshombe failed to show up at the party,
but the operation went smoothly anyway . when the sandwiches were
munched and the tea sipped, noronha led a three-mile column of 1,000
indian troops straight into kolwezi . where were those proud katangese
defenders ? hundreds of gendarmes had fled into the bush before the
blue-helmeted u.n . troops arrived . some 75 white mercenaries,
including a pistol-packing blonde ambulance driver known around town as
madame yvette, had taken off for the angolan border . but most of
tshombe's 2,000 bedraggled men paid heed to his plea to " cooperate
with the u.n . and our congolese brothers, " dutifully stacked their
arms at a nearby depot . at his yellow villa on the edge of kolwezi,
tshombe greeted noronha with a grin . " nobody shot at you, i see, " he
cracked . replied noronha, throwing an arm around tshombe's shoulders,
/ i have come to thank you for keeping your word . " noronha was not
the only one who was relieved that tshombe was sticking to his promise
to reintegrate katanga with the rest of the congo . at u.n .
headquarters in manhattan,secretary-general u thant could now turn to a
problem that might turn out to be even tougher than ending tshombe's
secession . it was to establish the congolese central government's
authority over all the congo and end the anarchy that still reigns in
much of the nation . as a starter, thant appealed for $19 million to
finance 1963 civilian operations in the congo, estimated that at least
1,300 technical experts would be needed at once in the biggest aid
program the u.n . has yet undertaken . the plan is to cut the u.n.'s
19,000-man army in the congo by 50 per cent as soon as possible perhaps

iran the munificent king once again the streets of teheran rang
with angry shouts . two thousand workers invaded the university campus
to battle students . in the teeming bazaar, steelhelmeted police beat
back religious leaders who were attempting a three-day strike . all the
excitement was over the social reforms of iran's 43-year-old king of
kings, shah mohammed reza pahlevi . after years of hesitation, the shah
at last was tearing the land from iran's feudal village owners and
religious leaders, distributing it to the peasants, and forcing factory
owners to give workers a 20 per cent share of their profits . the
moslem mullahs (priests), whose shrine lands were up for leasing to
iran's landless farmers, did not like the idea at all . students
protested the shah's dissolution of the majlis (parliament) a year and
a half ago after the legislators rigged elections, then crippled the
royal land reform bill with 93 amendments . since then, ruling by
decree, the shah has distributed 2,000,000 acres of private land (with
compensation to owners) to some 50,000 peasant families in 3,500
villages . it was some record for a monarch who once seemed ineffectual
and powerless to stave off the growing discontent of iran's poor masses.
a decade before, few would have imagined that workers and farmers
would be crying his slogans, waving his banners . but there they were
on the eve of the big referendum called to give the nation's yes or no
to his sweeping plans for aid to needy rural and city iranians . women,
who got the vote for the first time in iran's history, gathered at
polling places to shout, " long live mohammed reza shah for granting us
freedom . " the nation's poor were equally enthusiastic, flocked to
cast their ballots in unprecedented numbers . the shah expected a
landslide victory, and sure enough, early returns backed his referendum
by the lopsided margin of 1,000 to one . the popular enthusiasm was
doubtless aided by the shah's announcement on the eve of elections that
he was giving up the last of his own royal land, 3,500,000 acres on the

west was ready to write off algeria's brash, sloganeering premier ahmed
ben bella as a mediterranean castro ripe for red domination . but times
do change . after seven months of independence, ben bella now relies on
a tide of aid from the west, not the east, to keep his struggling
country afloat . only last week, finance minister ahmed francis
returned from paris with pledges of $280 million in french aid for 1963.
at the same time, the u.s . tentatively agreed to launch a food
relief program for hardhit algerian peasants ; ben bella hopes this
can be broadened into a sweeping program of economic aid before long .
emptied by war . ravaged by 7f years of war with france, the bloody
s.a.o . terror and a fratricidal power struggle that soured the first
months of independence, algeria needs every centime it can get . only
one algerian in ten has a steady job . the illiteracy rate is 90 per
cent . officials figure that the country needs at least $2 billion to
rebuild, but the treasury is bare . said ben bella : " we are a
country emptied by war . " to fill it up again, ben bella needs western
help . at first, embittered by his 5f years in french prisons, he
blinkered himself to that fact . he threatened to turn all remaining
french-owned lands into state-run farms . he sauntered off to havana to
embrace fidel castro right after a meeting with president kennedy . he
accepted what little red aid he got with great fanfare, but
deliberately played down far more extensive help from the west
including a flood of food shipments from private u.s . charities that
have kept nearly half of his 10 million people from starving . but
beneath the bluster ben bella is more pragmatist than dogmatist, and
algeria's sorry state persuaded him to begin tacking with the western
wind . " he is determined to feed, clothe and employ his people, " said
one western diplomat, " and he's going to kick over any " isms' that
get in his way . " over the protests of militant marxists, he began
promoting " healthy cooperation " with france, sought increased aid . "
they are duty bound to help us reconstruct, " he said in an interview
with time correspondent james wilde . " this would help dissipate all
that went before . " france is committed to give algeria a minimum of
$200 million a year for the next three years and is sponsoring its
association with the common market . nearly 90 per cent of the
1,200,000 europeans who once tended algeria's vineyards and ran its
businesses have fled (along with some 200,000 job-seeking moslems), but
officials now are anxious to lure back teachers, technicians and
administrators to help straighten out the mess . year of austerity . to
strengthen his shaky position, ben bella is clearing the field of
opposition by persuasion where possible, force where necessary . he has
banned all parties except his national liberation front (f.l.n.) .
fortnight ago, he ousted extreme leftist leaders of the 300,000-member
general union of algerian workers because they were resisting his
rapprochement with france, replaced them with trusted pro-government
men . though the problems of regionalism and marauding guerrillas still
plague him, he has managed to win over most of the hostile tribal
chieftains in the hinterlands to his side . ben bella's biggest problem
by far is the economy . this year, he said, will be one " of austerity,
of convalescence . " to show that he means business, he pushed through
a skin-and-bones budget of $564 million, giving some ministries
one-tenth of what they had demanded . he also put a $400-a-month
ceiling on all government salaries his own included and slapped a 100
per per cent tax on income above $800 a month . to the ascetic ben
bella, who lives in a dingy, three-room bachelor flat with a nephew who
does all the cooking and cleaning, that seems perfectly reasonable .
for those who think otherwise, he has a stern answer . " this, " says
ben bella, " is the price of independence . "

egypt surprise at suez when egypt's president gamal abdel nasser
grabbed the suez canal 6f years ago, his bitter enemies in europe
predicted that the big ditch would soon be filled with silt and that
untrained egyptian pilots would never be able to steer shipping through
safely . the critics turned out to be wrong on both counts . egypt has
widened the canal with bypasses permitting three convoys daily to use
the waterway more efficiently, and deepened it sufficiently to
accommodate most of the world's tanker fleet . last year 18,518 ships
traveled through the canal, 370 more than in 1961 . further plans call
for additional deepening of the canal, and making it two-way for its
entire 102-mile length . former stockholders of the old suez canal co .
were firmly convinced in 1956 that they would never get a cent out of
their nationalized investment . but with 1962 revenue at a whopping
$149.5 million (45 per cent above 1955), nasser's canal officials have
announced payment of the final $11.4 million installment on the $81.2
million compensation debt . responsible for the canal's success is its
egyptian boss, dynamic, balding mahmoud younis, 50, a onetime army
engineer and a close friend of nasser since the days when they shared
an office at the staff officers college, egypt's west point . though
younis had never sailed so much as a rowboat, nasser picked him to run
the busy waterway shortly after the british and french ship pilots
withdrew from the canal in september 1956 . at first, younis had
available only 26 trained pilots of the 250 normally required, but he
kept the canal functioning around the clock . " i didn't know anything
about ships, " he said . " but i did know a lot about movement control
from the army . keeping the ships shuttling back and forth was a simple
matter compared with organizing a battle . " younis takes great pride
in the performance of his egyptian pilots . " they thought that only
europeans could run the canal, but they were wrong, " he says . " i
have no inferiority complexes . to me, management is a science that
anyone can master . " u.s . shippers are full of admiration for the
efficient service they get in younis' canal . to them, he shrugs, " in

india buying time after two days of bitter debate in new delhi's
lok sabha, the indian parliament last week approved prime minister
nehru's decision to accept a neutralist proposal for the settlement of
india's himalayan border dispute with red china provided that the
chinese also agree to the neutrals' plan in toto . under the
arrangement devised by the six nonaligned nations ghana, egypt,
indonesia, burma, cambodia and ceylon at the colombo conference last
december, the chinese will be forced to withdraw 12f miles from the
present cease-fire line in the northwestern himalayas . but the
resultant demilitarized zone will still recognize china's pre-invasion
claim to 14,000 sq . mi . of indian territory in ladakh . by his
willingness to negotiate on these terms, nehru hopes to stall the
chinese at the conference table until he can get more military aid from
the west . recently, nehru repeated his urgent request to president
kennedy that a joint western air mission " get here as soon as possible
/ to study plans for the air defense of india .
due in new delhi this week is a team of u.s ., british,
canadian and australian air force officers . foreseen is the
lengthening of indian runways and the establishment of a radar network
so that western interceptor squadrons, complete with pilots and ground
personnel, can move into india to provide a protective air umbrella
over its cities . the idea would not quite constitute a military
alliance, but it would surely be india's most decisive step away from
neutralism .

europe a new & obscure destination
in an alliance in which partners had become increasingly
mindful of one another's sensitivities, in which victories were
tactfully not crowed over, and togetherness in itself was regarded as a
good thing, charles de gaulle last week reminded the world of what one
man with a will can do . over the past 20 years, on his own people and
on their neighbors, charles de gaulle has perfected his native talent
for handing out rude surprises . employing the lofty disdain that used
to infuriate roosevelt, churchill and stalin, de gaulle succeeded in
infuriating kennedy, macmillan and a host of others by vetoing
britain's admission to the common market . he might have been gentle
about it, allowing negotiations to sputter out in a confusion of
details . he chose to be blunt and his purpose was not just to shut
out britain or merely to humiliate her . he also shook the atlantic
alliance to its roots, set out to contest its leadership and to put in
question the future role of the u.s . in europe . for the west !
he created a dramatic historical turn, an obscure destination . dead
mechanism . western europe heard the news with anger and dismay . west
germany's economics minister ludwig erhard blamed de gaulle for a "
black day, " declaring that " the common market is now only a mechanism
and no longer a living thing . " alfred mullerarmack, west germany's
chief negotiator at brussels, quit his job in disgust . jean monnet,
the dynamic optimist who is the father of the common market, lamented
that " there now looms disunion with its inherent dangers . " britain's
prime minister harold macmillan told his country on tv : " what
happened at brussels was bad . bad for us, bad for europe, bad for the
whole world . " , " brutal " was the word heard most often in whitehall
and around the white house to describe de gaulle's behavior . architect
or at least co-designers of the atlantic alliance, u.s .
policymakers were plunged into gloom . " most unfortunate, " said the
state department . in congress there were revived mutterings about the
inefficacy of foreign aid and the ingratitude of allies . arkansas'
senator william fulbright talked of the " temporary aberration " of the
man . a nation that had hoped to be in a position to profit from the
communist split between russia and red china found a deep crevice
opening at its feet . and though the kennedy administration did not
speak of an " agonizing reappraisal " of its relations with a
recalcitrant france as john foster dulles once had u.s . military and
diplomatic policy toward europe was plainly in need of one . community
twilight . except for a glow of pride, tempered with nervous concern,
among some frenchmen, the only cheerful voices were being raised in
moscow, where soviet ideologists suddenly thought they saw confirmation
of the hoary marxist-leninist tenet that capitalist countries will
inevitably be destroyed by their " inner contradictions . " cried a
russian spokesman : " this is the twilight of the so-called european
community . a difficult navigation now awaits the american ship of
state . " not just the fact of what charles de gaulle had already done
tormented his allies : it was what he might yet do . and they searched
his prescient pronouncements from the past (see box) for clues . for 20
years the u.s . has been accustomed to lead the free world, and in that
time western europe rose from the ashes behind a shield of u.s men and
money . france itself has received $9.5 billion in outright aid and
$1.8 billion in loans since 1945 . there have of course been disputes
and differences of opinion, but until last week, no direct challenge of
u.s . leadership . what the u.s . now faced was a proposal that europe
rally round france to create a third force in the world capable of
dealing independently with both the u.s . and russia . this had been de
gaulle's proclaimed goal for years, but everyone had counted on his own
realistic appreciation of the increasing gains to france and europe of
the current course of atlantic partnership . it was a crowning irony
that de gaulle's effort to give europe a new voice, direction and
self-assurance is precisely what the u.s . has been trying to do ever
since world war ii . but the u.s . hardly expected things to work out
quite this way .
pictures in the louvre .
that they did is the
responsibility of one man charles andre marie joseph de gaulle, 72 .
his ability to bring a skillful influence to bear upon events should be
enough to send a believer in impersonal historical determinism back to
his books . tall and ungainly, so dim-eyed that he constantly stumbles,
so seldom a listener that he seems deaf, de gaulle should be a figure
of fun (and sometimes is), but the greatness in the man usually
survives the mockery . his mind is like the louvre, filled with battle
pictures in which the french are always winning ; his heart throbs
with simple emotions labeled patrie, dieu, gloire, and he has a gift
for prophecy that is more old testament than 20th century modern . de
gaulle's faults are common to many men he is bullheaded, arrogant,
touchy, more responsive to flattery than criticism, insufferably proud
of his intellect and insight . his virtues, however, are rare in any
age, and are summed up in the word character . what happened last week
in brussels was a head-on collision between charles de gaulle's design
for europe and the wider, world-embracing atlantic policy followed by
the last three american presidents and by most of the parliamentarians
of europe . lofted umbrella . the u.s . attitude, on which one
presidential speechwriter hung the ambitious phrase " grand design, "
is to accept and work for the concept of a strong, united europe linked
in partnership with north america, both acting together to raise the
living standards and secure the independence of the nations of africa,
asia and latin america . to make this design enduring, the u.s .
insisted that britain become a member of the common market, followed by
the scandinavian and other nato countries . the defense of this grand
design would be twofold : conventional arms and armies supplied by
europe, and the nuclear umbrella held aloft by the u.s . de gaulle's
european design is introverted, smaller, and dependent more on audacity
and cleverness than on sheer power . in effect, it represents another
of the historic efforts to create a unified europe under french
leadership an ambition that was pursued in the past by charlemagne,
louis xiv, napoleon bonaparte and napoleon iii . to de gaulle, europe's
rivers and mountains are not barriers, but the oceans are . since 1940
he has dreamed of persuading the " states along the rhine, the alps and
the pyrenees to form a political, economic and strategic bloc ; to
establish this organization as one of the three world powers, and,
should pickup strategic bloc ; to establish this organization as one
of the three world powers, and, should it become necessary, as the
arbiter between the soviet and the angloamerican camps . " gargantuan
stocks . conceivably, de gaulle at one point might have been weaned
away from his dream . when he returned to power in 1958 to lead a
france still riven by the algerian war, he demanded admission to a
three-power directorate of nato, but the idea was blackballed by
eisenhower and macmillan . he probably would have been as intransigent
as a co-director as he has been without becoming one . since then, he
progressively withdrew french ground and naval forces from nato
commands, banished u.s . nuclear warheads from french soil, and sank
billions of francs into a crash program to create a nuclear force de
frappe of his own . as of last week the force de frappe consisted of a
handful of atom bombs and a delivery system of exactly four mirage iv
jets, extremely fast (mach 2), highaltitude, two-seat light bombers .
the mirage iv's radius is only 1,000 miles . admittedly the force de
frappe is a modest operation and one that could swiftly be knocked out
of the air, even when, by 1965, the french hope to have 350 planes
capable of carrying atomic weapons . de gaulle concedes that his
nuclear weaponry will never match the gargantuan and lethal stockpiles
of russia and the u.s . but he thinks that it is big enough and
murderous enough to give any potential aggressor pause and besides, it
is his own . unfit islanders . in de gaulle's europe, france is first,
germany second, and the rest nowhere they can tag along respectfully as
camp followers, with little more weight or voice than tiny luxembourg .
britain is rejected as unfit economically or politically to join this
band of continental brothers because it 1) is an offshore island, and
2) has " special ties " with the u.s . and the commonwealth . to de
gaulle's jaundiced eye, the british attempt to enter the common market
was simply a trojan horse maneuver (an expression used with suspicious
frequency in parisian editorials and salons last week) staged by
washington to make sure that the u.s . domination of europe would not
be frustrated . britain did much to arrange her own fate . in 1950,
london was offered membership in the european coal and steel community
and refused . seven years later, london was invited to join in the
founding of the common market, and again refused . as the common market
got under way, britain tried to cripple it by setting up its own ragtag
rival bloc, the seven-nation european free trade association (with
austria, denmark, norway, portugal, sweden, switzerland) . but the
runaway economic success of the common market caused britain's
conservative government to reverse itself, and, in august 1961, britain
penitently applied for the membership it had once spurned . it asked
for full, not associate membership, with all that this implied in
declaring itself european . the application might have been received in
brussels, de gaulle insisted that britain bring it to paris instead .
/ matter of days . " during the slow first year of the brussels
negotiations, de gaulle was not actively in opposition . but he soon
made it clear he considered the british as suppliants, not equals :.
they could not hope to change the rules as a condition of joining the
club . the technical discussions ranged from such obscure items as the
tariff on kips and pigmeat to important ones concerning future trade
with australia and new zealand . by last month, of more than 2,500 big
and small questions, all but 26 had been amicably resolved . britain's
chief negotiator, edward heath, was so optimistic that on jan . 21 he
confidently told a u.s . official : " it is only a matter of days
before the question is settled in our favor .
this was brave but foolhardy disregard of the
imperious non uttered just a week before in de gaulle's celebrated
press conference, the theatrical shocker in which the " insular,
maritime " british were haughtily told to transform themselves into "
europeans " before joining the common market . de gaulle has long been
suspicious of britain's close ties with the u.s., and suspects that
secrets can be exchanged in the common english language . but de
gaulle's determination to veto britain's membership apparently came
just before christmas, when the news arrived of the kennedy-macmillan
meeting at nassau . at nassau, britain got formal word that the u.s .
would not supply it with skybolt, the airborne missile on which the
british had pinned all their hopes for delivering their nuclear
deterrent . skybolt shattered the british, and disquieted the french as
well, since it was regarded as proof that nuclear dependence on another
power was risky . if the u.s . could treat in that fashion an ally to
whom it was tied by blood, language and tradition, what could france
expect ? de gaulle was further angered by macmillan's agreement to
share polaris with the u.s . instead of moving to share nuclear
knowledge with france . that was when the phrase " trojan horse " first
began to be used in paris . overnight case . brussels, the scene of
britain's dashed hopes last week, is a dour, neon-lit old maid of a
city . on monday, the cobbled streets were slimy with black slush and
blanketed with chilling fog as britain's chief negotiator, edward
heath, arrived with his aides, minister for commonwealth affairs duncan
sandys and agriculture minister christopher soames . the french, with a
fine sense of economy, traveled light ; only luxembourg's four-man
delegation was smaller . french foreign minister maurice couve de
murville brought only an overnight case, for he knew that he would not
be staying long . couve arrived an hour late for the start of the
meeting at quatre bras, the modern foreign ministry building .
newsmen's questions to him died in the air at the grim set of the
frenchman's face . a path two feet wide miraculously parted the crowd
and, like an apparition or a leper couve moved unmolested to the
elevator . when the delegates emerged from the meeting at midnight,
west germany's economics minister ludwig erhard, a staunch supporter of
britain, grunted, " we made only linguistic progress . " a french
delegate lightly added, " if we reach an agreement, it will be based on
a misunderstanding . " on tuesday morning, u.s . ambassador john
tuthill hurried around to the delegations to deliver a lastminute
warning from president kennedy, pointing out the grave consequences of
a breakdown in the negotiations . the six reconvened at noon to hear
the west german proposal that was intended to save face for everyone by
postponing a decision for two months . a stormy discussion followed,
and couve de murville icily professed astonishment that a plan could
even be proposed in such bad parliamentary form .
monstrous thing .  in turn, the delegates of the other five warned
of the consequences of a rupture, but france's couve de murville was
adamant .  walter hallstein, chairman of the common market commission,
tried to change the wording of the proposal to make it more acceptable
to the french .  he failed .  there was nothing to do but summon heath
to hear the final verdict .  each head of delegation read a prepared
statement .  belgium's spaak called the rupture a "monstrous thing ."
dutch foreign minister joseph luns was equally bitter, while
germany's schroder pointedly told the french that the bundestag had
only ratified the treaty of rome in the first place on the assumption
that it would be widened to embrace new members .  then at last it
was couve de murville's turn .  couve, a brilliant, civilized,
highly trained diplomatist, who among his colleagues would usually
be seeking any new avenue of compromise, was now plainly little more
than a messenger boy for le grand charles .  "it is being said that we
broke off the negotiations," he declared .  "in reality, our
responsibility has been that of making clear that the negotiations have
been taking place in a vacuum since october, and of having said that it
is preferable to face the facts .  then he echoed the boss again .
when britain can accept all the requirements of the treaty of rome,
nothing can stop her from entering the common market .  but it is upon
her and not on us that the burden of proof lies .  it would have been
a little late in the day, but many at the table thought that it would
have been wonderful had heath given in entirely at this point and taken
couve up on his offer with no more haggling .  but the briton limited
himself to a dispassionate rebuttal .  "it has been contended," he said
,"that britain is not european enough .  there are many millions in
europe who know perfectly well how european britain has been in the
past and are grateful for it ."  added heath :"the truth is that
some people regarded the negotiations as being too close to success,
though they gave other reasons for breaking them off ."  when he
stopped speaking, all the delegates crowded around to shake his hand
all but france's men, who left unsmiling .  five stateless ones .  the
common market as it now exists offers a superb instrument for de
gaulle's strong hand to wield, even though he was contemptuous of it at
the start, and dismisses the eurocrats who work for it as les apatrides,
the stateless ones . after five years of operation its gross national
product stands at $210 billion, and industrial production has soared
40 per cent . the common market poured almost 80 million tons of steel
last year (compared with the u.s .'s 98 million tons), and is the
world's second largest automobile maker . as the world's biggest
trader, the common market is first in imports, second only to the
u.s . in exports . since 1958, imports from the rest of the world have
risen 39 per cent, those from the u.s . a giant 59 per cent, thus aiding
washington's desperate balance-of-payment problems . the question most
asked last week was whether the other five west germany, italy
and the benelux countries would permit le grand charles to make
the market his device for power . what de gaulle has demonstrated is
that he can blackball any nation he does not want in the common
market ("french shoulders are broad enough to bear the burden," said
a spokesman) . but de gaulle has yet to show that he can remake
europe in france's image . britain and the u.s . are betting that he
never will . indeed, the unanimous outcry from the other five common
market nations last week was ample testimony that they are currently
determined to resist france's grasp for leadership . last week the
five abruptly forced postponement of a special meeting of the common
market finance ministers called by the french to investigate the
extent of u.s . investment in europe, a pet hate of de gaulle's these
days . this rebuff disturbed french minister of finance valery giscard
d'estaing not at all . he reportedly remarked that the five had merely
deprived him of his dessert meaning, presumably, that france had
already enjoyed the british lion for breakfast . the five have also
shown signs of blocking other french projects, e.g ., algeria's
association with the six . sharp divisions . but as the initial and
genuine anger diminished, there was a question whether the smaller
countries, in their anxiety to bring britain in as a political
counterbalance to france and germany, would be willing to endanger the
common market itself . their economies are so dependent on the market
as a trading partner that it is inconceivable that any of them would be
able to separate out their own marbles to take them home .
it is west germany's support that charles de
gaulle needs to win the whiphand over europe . he had a stalwart
partner in 87-year-old chancellor konrad adenauer, the rhinelander
whose lifelong dream has been franco-german rapprochement . as it
happened, adenauer arrived in the elysee palace last month to sign the
treaty of friendship and cooperation with france at the very time when
de gaulle had sprung his large scheme on europe . by all accounts,
adenauer did not fully realize that the document he had signed was the
reinforcing seal of doom for britain's membership in europe and that he
was now put at odds with the u.s . scheme of things . at the ceremony
in paris, adenauer gently asked de gaulle not to force the germans into
the awkward position of choosing between the u.s . and france . tut,
tut, replied de gaulle reassuringly, "france has no intention of
putting germany into a position where such a choice would be necessary .
deserved whippings . whatever konrad adenauer desires, he is no
longer undisputed master at home . with economics minister (and
possible next chancellor) ludwig erhard threatening to resign if the
adenauer-de gaulle treaty is ratified before concessions are granted in
the common market, west germany's support for le grand charles is in
jeopardy indeed . already leaders of opposition factions in the
bundestag have warned that they would block ratification of the
franco-german treaty . it was a measure of de gaulle's rapid rise of
prestige that all the german papers posed the matter as a question of
choosing between the u.s . and france . most, understandably, chose the
u.s . the influential protestation in washington rests on its firm
loyalty to an american-led nato . the americans will sooner or later
withdraw from the continent if they get the impression that the federal
republic failed to oppose de gaulle's intention to undermine nato from
within .
sibylline delights . le figaro's gifted commentator
raymond aron, whose admiration for de gaulle is qualified, remarked
last week that he is convinced that the general takes "lonely pleasure
in the spectacle of the arguments he causes ." what disturbs many
americans is not de gaulle's effort to assert a reviving continent's
strength, but his future plans for europe . and what disturbs many
continentals is de gaulle's readiness to be far more disregarding of
their sensibilities than the u.s . has been . a de gaulle agreement to
consult, as adenauer and others have found out, means his willingness
to give the other partner an audience to hear de gaulle's intentions .
de gaulle accepts the commitments france entered into while he was not
in power, but distorts them to france's advantage . after vetoing
britain, de gaulle last week invited danish premier jens otto krag to
join the common market either as full member or as associate an
invitation that the other five members indignantly thought was the
responsibility of all six to extend . krag's own surprised reaction was
to say that denmark's hopes were "based on the assumption that britain
would join the common market ." similarly, the other partners were
suspicious of de gaulle's intense side cultivation of spain last week,
and his long private talks with soviet ambassador sergei vinogradov,
who in the years de gaulle was not in power kept up his close contacts
with him . last week france signed a bilateral trade agreement with
russia, calling for a 10 per cent increase in trade between the two
powers . will de gaulle take it upon himself to negotiate separately
with the soviet union ? his anti-communist bona fides has been amply
proved by his stands on berlin and cuba, when he firmly backed kennedy .
there is a story that, in 1941, when hitler invaded russia, de gaulle
told an aide, " now we must begin thinking of stopping the communist
push in europe . " the aide protested that the prospect seemed remote,
and de gaulle replied, " remember these hours . i often make mistakes
in what i do, but never in what i predict . " acts, not words . in
talking to his friends, de gaulle makes it plain that he thinks the
situation behind the iron curtain offers an opportunity for the west .
he argues that the sino-soviet split, the economic pull of western
europe, the gradual " bourgeoisation " of russia all contribute to
turning the communists, and especially the eastern european satellites,
westward . and out of this he conceives of some kind of european
arrangement, never fully defined, " stretching from the atlantic to the
urals . " holding this vision, de gaulle has never ruled out
negotiation with moscow he merely sets the condition that the russians
must first prove themselves in acts, not words . those who fear de
gaulle's intentions wonder whether he will at some future moment
consider a disengagement in europe in which the 400,000 u.s . troops
would go home in return for a russian pull-out of eastern europe . this
may be one reason why he wants his own nuclear force .
no one in the world, particularly no one
in america, can say whether, where, when, how and to what extent
american nuclear weapons will be used in defense of europe . " and, he
argues, " it is intolerable for a great state that her fate be left to
the decisions and action of another state, however friendly she may be
. " it is a powerful point, and is not fully met by offering u.s .
nuclear weapons to a european nato group, since the final decision to
launch any bombs would still presumably be in u.s . hands . purged
britain . time was when the u.s . called the tune on such crucial
questions . de gaulle's dramatic action raises the question whether the
u.s . can, or should, continue to do so indefinitely . in his final
words to his common market partners, france's couve de murville
somberly expressed de gaulle's thoughts on the matter . " i will say
once again that we are not seeking to maintain a large or small europe,
but to know if the europe we are creating is a european europe . " in
effect, he seemed to be saying : if britain one day truly purged
itself of its close american connection, it might prove itself eligible
at last, in charles de gaulle's eyes, for common market membership .
irritating as it might be, it was an idea with some force . so
sympathetic a transatlantic figure as britain's viscount hailsham,
speaking in manhattan fortnight ago, gently warned president kennedy
not to think that he is the " commander in chief of the forces of the
free world . " in fact, said lord hailsham, " this is precisely what he
is not if the allies to which he is bound are not to be deprived of the
very independence for which they are prepared to unite . " the
superiority in numbers, wealth and strength, and therefore in influence
and initiative, of the u.s., is not in question . nor is its integrity
. . . (but) have the americans paused to reflect that an alliance in
which all the advanced and sophisticated technologies were left to one
of the partners, and the rest were relegated to supply a complement of
conventional arms in war, and in commerce a modest contribution of
scotch whisky and compact cars . . . would not ultimately succeed in
retaining the loyalty of european electors ?

as a writer, charles
de gaulle has the gift of clarity, as a politician he knows the uses of
ambiguity, and as a statesman he has shown remarkable consistency .
from nearly 30 years of writings and remarks come these affirmations of
his aspirations and ambitions : on nato alliances do not settle
everything . (1963) the glory of france our country, with her tinted
sky, her varied contours, her fertile soil, our fields full of fine
corn and vines and livestock, our industry, our gifts of initiative,
adaptation and self-respect, make us, above all others, a race created
for brilliant deeds . the sword is the axis of the world, and greatness
cannot be shared . (1934) . the emotional side of me tends to
imagine france, like the princess in the stories or the madonna in the
frescoes, as dedicated to an exalted and exceptional destiny . but the
positive side of my mind also assures me that france is not really
herself unless in the front rank ; that only vast enterprises are
capable of counterbalancing the divisive ferments which are inherent in
her people . in short, to my mind, france cannot be france without
greatness . (2955) . who in good faith can dispute the fact
that france must help to build western europe into an organized union
of states so that gradually there may be established the most powerful,
prosperous and influential political, economic and military complex in
the world ? (1962) from the atlantic to the urals the equilibrium of
europe, the guarantee of peace along the rhine, the independence of the
vistula, danube and balkan states, the creation of some form of
association with the peoples all over the world to whom we have opened
the doors of western civilization, an organization of nations which
will be something more than an arena for disputes between america and
russia these surely are our great interests in tomorrow's world .
(1944) . perhaps it might be possible to renew franco-russian
solidarity in some fashion, which, even if repeatedly betrayed and
repudiated,
remains no
less a part of the natural order of things both with regard to the
german danger and the anglo-saxon efforts to assert their hegemony .
(1944) . i am convinced that if france took the initiative to
summon europe to organize itself, in particular with german help, the
whole european atmosphere from the atlantic to the urals would be
changed . (1950) the americans in the mortal dangers we french have
survived since the beginning of the century, the u.s . has not given us
the impression that it regards its own destiny as linked with that of
france, that it wishes france to be great and strong, that it is doing
all it can to help her to remain or become so once again . (1945) .
the alliance has been built on the basis of integration, in
which the defense of each of the countries of continental europe, apart
from england, has no national character, in which in fact all is
commanded by the americans, and it is the americans who determine the
use of your atomic weapons . (1960) . the american interest is
not always the french interest . this will be more and more true in the
future, which will give europe a greater and greater weight, and which
will therefore contribute to diminishing the relative weight of the u.s
. (1963) . following britain, other states would want to enter
the common market . in the end there would appear a colossal atlantic
community under american dependence and leadership, which would soon
completely swallow up the european community . (1963) britain & europe
england and france will together create peace, as twice in 30 years
they have together confronted war . (1944) . england has
turned over to the americans what meager atomic forces she had . she
could have turned them over to europe . thus she has made her choice .
i am distressed to see england align herself with the u.s., for she
risks acting like their traveling salesman . the english will no doubt
enter the common market, perhaps in 50 years, and i will without doubt
no longer be here . (1963) third force i have sought to assure france
primacy in western europe by preventing the rise of a new reich that
might again threaten its safety ; to cooperate with east and west and,
if need be, contract the necessary alliances on one side or the other
without ever accepting any kind of dependency ; to persuade the states
along the rhine, the alps and the pyrenees to form a political,
economic and strategic bloc ; to establish this organization as one of
the three world powers and, if necessary, as the arbiter between the
soviet and anglo-american camps . since 1940, my every word and deed
has been dedicated to establishing these possibilities . (1955) .
only france knows that peace or war will be decided in europe
. yes, it is europe, it is all europe that will decide the destiny of
the world . if the peoples of europe, on whichever side of the curtain
they find themselves, want to establish concord among themselves, then
peace will be assured . but if europe remains divided in two opposed
factions, war will sooner or later destroy the human race . (1959) .
who can say what tomorrow will bring ? who can say that, in
the future, if the political background should change completely, the
two powers (the u.s . and russia) that have the nuclear monopoly will
not agree to divide the world ? who can say that if the occasion
arises, each of the two, while deciding not to launch its missiles at
the main enemy, so that it might itself be spared, will not crush the
others ? it is possible to imagine that, on some awful day, western
europe would be wiped out from moscow and central europe from
washington . and who can even say that the two rivals, after i know not
what political upheaval, will not unite ? (1959) on leadership glory
gives herself only to those who have always dreamed of her . (1934) .
it was by acting as the inflexible champion of the nation and
the state that it was possible for me to gather the consent, even the
enthusiasm, of the french, and to win from foreigners respect and
consideration . those who were offended by this intransigence were
unwilling to see that for me the slightest wavering would have brought
collapse . limited and alone though i was, i had to climb to the
heights and never then to come down . (1940, describing his wartime
leadership) . every man of action has a strong dose of
egotism, pride, hardness and cunning . but all those things will be
forgiven him if he can make of them the means to achieve great ends .
aloofness, character, and the personification of greatness, these
qualities it is that surround with prestige those who are prepared to
carry a burden which is too heavy for lesser mortals .

cambodia the man who wouldn't be king once he dreamed of
going to hollywood as the " cambodian charlie chan . " then he took up
the saxophone and made like " cannonball " adderley, belting out such
compositions of his own as love without hope . he supported a troupe of
30 dancing girls and a string of 20 thoroughbreds and worked diligently
to improve the breed . sports are his latest craze . he captains a
championship volleyball team and recently dunked in 92 points in a
basketball game . eccentric and mercurial he may be, but cambodia's
prince norodom sihanouk, 41, is also one of the shrewdest leaders in
southeast asia . sihanouk was cambodia's young king until 1955, when he
stepped down from the throne to run for elective office in the
government, because the " true face of the people was hidden from me .
/ under his leadership, cambodia has embarked on an ambitious program
of development . last year the rice crop was the best in memory, and a
record exportable surplus of 400,000 tons was predicted . cambodia does
not have one riel of external debt, and its currency is 100 per cent
covered by gold and foreign exchange (v . 50 per cent in the u.s.) ;
25 per cent of the budget is spent on education, one of the highest
percentages in the world . " socialist majesties . " but cambodia, like
many pleasant and languid places, is now beset by pressing economic
problems . the planned $26 million deficit for this fiscal year has
unexpectedly doubled, and the government is so short of cash that the
current five year plan is literally out of money . some $24 million
worth of public projects have had to be canceled, and foreign exchange
reserves are dwindling at the rate of $1,500,000 a month . sihanouk's
reaction was characteristically unpredictable ; he purged his
government of its oldtimers and installed in their places a group of
his most fiery critics . they are youthful (average age : 36),
left-wing, paris-trained intellectuals whom sihanouk sneeringly calls "
their socialist majesties . " says sihanouk : " i know that they do
not like me . they hate me . they have always supported the communists
. now i've given them the opportunity of supporting cambodia for the
first time . i told them, " you can kill me, but you have no right to
kill cambodia . " ' what's good for g . m . . . . behind sihanouk's odd
choice of ministers is an adroit policy . with opponents in his very
cabinet, sihanouk is able to keep an eye on his foes, and to force them
to share blame for a worsening financial situation . he has allowed the
cabinet to slash government expenditures, but vetoed its proposal to
nationalize the french rubber plantations, which are a prime source of
foreign exchange . " the french might be capitalists, " sihanouk said,
/ but they are capable . " he also delights in pointing out to his
left-leaning intellectuals the failure of cambodia's red chinese-built
factories . " they only cost us money, " sihanouk says . " i tell my
cabinet that that's not what ford or general motors would do . " though
he deals roughly with cambodia's native communists, sihanouk artfully
refuses to join either the communist or western camps . hoping to keep
him neutral, the u.s . has weighed in with $300 million in economic aid
since 1955, to this nation of 5,700,000 people, and russia has built a
500-bed hospital and sent industrial equipment . currently, neutralist
sihanouk leans toward more western influence in his country, for he
feels that a counterbalance is needed against the rising strength of
the communists in southeast asia . but the main object of sihanouk's
policy is still to " maintain the joie de vivre of my people . i want
them to work also, but not so hard as communists . we cambodians are
not animals or machines . we have to remain gay and free . we must be
allowed to have the good things . /

the congo bare cupboard awaiting the victorious united nations
at the national bank of katanga in elisabethville were some legitimate
spoils or so it seemed should have been $16.2 million in congolese
francs originally deposited in the bank to support the currency of
moise tshombe's katanga and u.n . officials hoped to turn it over to
the congo
government for reconstruction . but when they got there, tshombe's
cupboard was bare . for weeks, the bank's directors had refused to open
their files and strongrooms to u.n . investigators, and now the reason
for their reluctance was clear . most of the records were gone, and
most of the cash . all the u.n . found was $116.28 in foreign currency
about enough to pay a congolese army sub-lieutenant for ten days . it
was not difficult to guess where the money went . tshombe's own
katangese officials had withdrawn huge sums of money without troubling
to leave receipts . one unnamed official waltzed off with 133 million
katangese francs (worth $2,660,000 at the official exchange rate of 50
to $1) in a single swipe . some 4,000 gold coins valued at $280,000
were smuggled to geneva for sale by a european syndicate . there was
evidence that the bank had transferred 1 billion francs to a branch 150
miles away in ndola, northern rhodesia, to buy arms and pay mercenaries
. with the central government in leopoldville already facing a 1963
deficit of $100 million, the looting of the bank was a sad blow . it
was also bad news to the u.s., which has already resigned itself to
donating another hefty subsidy to the congolese . last week a u.s . aid
team headed by assistant secretary of state harlan cleveland flew into
leopoldville to see what else was needed .

viscount was coming into a low-hanging cloud bank on its way toward a

were killed, and of another 120 hospitalized, ten were not expected to

metal plunging through the roofs of their homes . four people in a taxi
were crushed and killed by falling wreckage . ulus square became an
inferno of flame and choking smoke as fires touched off by a burst gas

japan getting there is not much fun " i wouldn't mind " said the
anxious housewife at the atami station of japan's national railways, "
except they were a new year's gift from my husband and he will kill me
if he finds they are missing . he will not believe what happened . " an
understanding man, the stationmaster wired ahead to nagoya . sure
enough, in one of the empty cars, there were the black lace panties
that the woman had been wearing until she was caught in the
rib-crunching free-for-all involved in getting on and off a train in
japan . the lady's plight, presumably the result of failing elastic or
flailing hands, is a familiar one to harried j.n.r . officials . their
lost-and-found warehouses bulge with an inventory that would do a
department store proud :. 1,800,000 items, including 25,000
wristwatches, 310,000 umbrellas, 180,000 books, 400,000 pieces of
clothing, ranging from garter belts to greatcoats, four urns containing
human ashes (prayed over daily by reverent warehouse employees), an
electric motor, one pinball machine, false teeth, and several false
eyeballs . only 15 per cent of the items are reclaimed . by auctioning
the rest, and by pocketing unclaimed cash, the railways grossed
$150,000 in 1962 . to reduce the size of its unwanted hoard, the
railways are now broadcasting urgent announcements on trains reminding
passengers to take their box lunches and briefcases . burial urns are
never mentioned, said one official, because " it's rather poor taste "
to say something like " please check to see you haven't forgotten your
grandmother . " but nobody expected the campaign to do much good .
while forgetfulness is much to blame, so is overcrowding . every day,
36 million japanese ride the trains, 4,200,000 in tokyo alone . at rush
hours, 350 commuters jam into cars designed for 100, helped by brawny
students who are paid 150 yen (42 #$ ) an hour to stand on the platform
and shoehorn people inside . when the doors open, the scrimmage begins
; cracked ribs are not uncommon . in such circumstances, the
passenger's first concern is for his safety, not for his packages or
even his clothes . in fact, so many commuters lose their shoes fighting
their way off the trains that the bigger stations now keep a supply of
assorted shoes on hand .

western europe round 1 to the general if most of europe
seemed angry at charles de gaulle last week, no one seemed to know
quite what to do about him . speaker after speaker at the european
parliament in strasbourg ringingly condemned charles de gaulle's
imperious thumbs down on british membership in the common market . as a
result, declared common market chairman walter hallstein, the six have
been plunged into their " first real crisis a crisis of confidence . "
in european capitals from bonn to rome, france's common market partners
spoke bravely of ganging up on de gaulle, perhaps by blocking his plans
for associating france's former african colonies with europe, or even
by boycotting french goods . empty chair ? but when the speeches were
over, european parliamentarians speechlessly realized that there was
almost no concrete action that they could take against le grand charles
. de gaulle seemed to hold all the trumps . some members of the other
common market five had talked of giving france the " empty-chair "
treatment, carrying on their efforts for european unity and atlantic
partnership without the french . yet what purpose would it serve to
exclude france from nato councils ? none at all . its contributions
to allied fighting strength are sufficiently meager it is two divisions
behind its commitments in germany, it withholds its mediterranean fleet
from nato, keeps most of its metropolitan territory out of the air
warning system, and even prohibits foreign nuclear weapons on french
soil . still, sheer geography gives france a veto on nato planning .
could france be ignored in the tariff discussions of the 40-odd members
of gatt, or in oecd, the european economic coordinating group that grew
out of the marshall plan ? hardly, since the economies of all western
european nations are intertwined with france's . the urgent french need
to export food surpluses, and its booming market for other nations'
industrial goods, are the stick and the carrot that have given the
community much of its momentum . even belgium's paul-henri spaak,
perhaps the most implacable foe of de gaulle's plans for europe, agreed
last week that there was no general support for retaliatory measures
against france . west germany's economics minister ludwig erhard, who
was in tears at brussels when france blackballed britain, went home
breathing defiance of de gaulle and threats to topple konrad adenauer
nowhere (see below) . and after all the oratory at strasbourg, a "
solemn protest " motion condemning de gaulle's " domination " of europe
was ignominiously defeated by a tie vote of 38-38 hardly a resounding
gesture of defiance . personality change . by their very lack of
passion at the new realities, european statesmen proved that there is
still a lot of life in deep-rooted nationalism, whether de gaulle's or
anyone else's . the communists had found out the same thing in
yugoslavia, poland, hungary and east germany . there were differences
: russia had tried to impose a unity, and western europeans had hoped
to evolve into a unity by democratic means and for mutual benefit .
western europeans still insist that the idea of europe will carry the
day, but at the moment there is a new consciousness of one another's
disparate tastes, talents and destinies . the french, aware of the
hostility of allies, were reassuring everybody that they were not
proposing to go it alone . foreign minister couve de murville said : "
it is not a question of freeing the european personality but of
remaining inside the atlantic alliance . " even so, europe's
personality had undoubtedly undergone a change . said one minister in
brussels last week : " for the present, only expect the things to be
done quickly around here that are plainly good for all the six
countries . it will be quit a while before we hear a minister in
council say he is voting for anything for the good the community as a
whole . /

france sparks across the channel for a man so insistent on
having his own sensibilities taken into account, charles de gaulle has
a gargantuan capacity for being indifferent to everyone else's . last
week, having stood france's friends and neighbors on their ears, de
gaulle triumphantly surveyed the scene for the benefit of some 120
newly elected national assembly deputies in a reception at elysee
palace . de gaulle, whose attitude toward economics is vague at best,
loftily explained to the deputies why the u.s . wanted britain in the
common market : " the americans are giving away their products to the
south americans, the africans, and even the arabs . therefore they must
try to sell them in europe, which can pay for them . " this was wildly
inaccurate : u.s . sales to japan and canada alone in 1962 totaled
almost twice as much as its $3.6 billion in exports to the common
market . with britain's exclusion, said le grand charles, the u.s . is
now " making use of england " to create " a vast new trade thingamajig
with the irish, the icelanders, and so forth . " then de gaulle turned
his remarks to the west germans, for whom he had some advice on how to
govern themselves . " what is needed in germany, " he declared, " is a
constitution that would permit it to face modern conditions . "
(germany's constitution was drafted and adopted in 1949.) change of
tone . de gaulle's most derisive comments were aimed at harold
macmillan and his countrymen, who " always manage to seem so
respectable . " describing the prime minister's talks with him at
rambouillet last december, he related : " mr . macmillan came to tell
me we were right in making our force de frappe . " we have our own,
too,' he told me . " we should try to associate them in a european
framework independent of america.' on this, he left me for the bahamas
. " there, according to de gaulle, macmillan betrayed him by agreeing
instead to accept polaris force from the u.s . and then to commit it,
along with britain's own new nuclear bombers, to a multinational nato
nuclear force . shrugging that this " naturally changed the tone " of
the jan . 14 press conference at which de gaulle gutted britain's hopes
of joining europe, de gaulle added testily : " mr . macmillan, whom i
like, has had the british press compare me to hitler and even to
napoleon . " in london, irate british officials were offended at the
idea that macmillan could dictate fleet street's line, even if he
wanted to . perhaps, they suggested acidly, he was confusing britain's
free press with france's, where de gaulle's side pronouncements and
little witticisms are fed to the paris press by the palace guard . a
great many talkative deputies had heard de gaulle's comments at his
palace reception, and the state-owned news agency had sent them out on
the wire . nonetheless, when the reverberations began, the palace
grandly issued a warning that the public " once again be on guard
against the publication of so-called declarations of general de gaulle
. " seven reasons . in london, british officials produced their own
minutes of the rambouillet talks, which contained no hint that
macmillan had ever proposed a deterrent " independent of america . "
the prime minister, they said, had indeed agreed that de gaulle should
push ahead with his force de frappe, but had pointedly expressed his
hopes that it would eventually be assigned to nato . snapped one
official : " the french have now given seven different reasons why de
gaulle turned down british membership . the only thing they haven't
claimed yet is that it was because scotland beat france 11-6 at rugby .
/ the real reason why de gaulle vetoed britain, retorted foreign
secretary lord home, was that " two visions of europe had come into
head-on collision . one was of europe so ordered that it would be a
third force, protected, exclusive, narcissus-like in its self-glory .
the other, a europe of equal, politically mature nations in complete
partnership with america and doing their duty by the whole world
outside . " with anglo-french relations in such an irritable state,
britain announced that the planned visit to paris of princess margaret
and her husband, lord snowden, for the movie premiere of lawrence of
arabia, had been canceled " on the advice of the government .

iraq friends & brothers not long ago, abdul karim
kassem, lean and psychotic strongman of iraq, boasted that he had
survived 38 attempts to kill him over the past 4f years . last week in
baghdad, death kept the 39th appointment . rebel iraqi army officers
overthrew the government and issued a characteristic middle eastern
communique : " with the help of god, we have been able to destroy the
enemy of god and of the people, abdul karim kassem, and his gang, who
have used the country for their own interests and who choked liberty
and disrupted the law ! " home & headquarters . the insurrection
began on friday, holiest day of the moslem week, and in the midst of
ramadan, the month when good moslems fast every day from sunup to
sundown and tempers are everywhere short . army trucks and tanks were
already rumbling through the streets when at 9 : 30 a.m., a strident
new voice on radio baghdad began exulting, " this is the voice of the
iraqi revolution ! " accusing " kassem the dictator " of having "
murdered citizens, weakened the army, imprisoned and executed scores of
officers, " the broadcaster claimed that the rebels " have destroyed
the tyrant ! " but the fight was only beginning . rebel units
surrounded baghdad's huge, yellow brick defense ministry, the home and
headquarters of premier kassem, which was defended by 600 trusted
soldiers . the rebels brought up tanks and heavy artillery, and iraqi
fighter planes strafed and bombed the kassem fortress . loyal disciple
. the rebel radio voice frenziedly called for the " people " to pour
into the streets " to destroy the remnants of the kassem regime . "
between exhortations, martial music filled the air, especially songs
extolling arab unity, and alahu akbar (god is great), a favorite hymn
of egypt's gamal abdel nasser . the six-man rebel junta that plotted
kassem's overthrow was apparently made up of captains and lieutenants,
except for its leader, ex-paratroop colonel abdul mustafa . but the man
they put forward as their front man came as a shock to kassem, fighting
for his life inside the battered defense ministry . the junta named as
its new rebel head of state colonel abdul salam aref, 41, long kassem's
closest friend and most loyal disciple, and alive only because kassem
commuted his 1959 death sentence . unshared prize . to kassem the coup
must have seemed only too familiar . in the same way back in 1958,
kassem seized power by ruthlessly slaughtering king feisal ii and his
iron-fisted, prowestern premier, nuri as-said, who was caught trying to
escape the city dressed in women's clothes . in those days kassem was a
brigadier, with the reputation of being the king's most loyal soldier .
actually, he was leader of a group of army conspirators including
mercurial colonel abdul salam aref, a passionate pronasserite . after
the young king was slain, kassem appointed himself premier,named aref
as his deputy, and proclaimed his dedication to " improving the living
standards of our population and saving them from living in slums .
two friends & brothers even though aref devotedly declared, /
i am kassem's son, " and bachelor kassem fondly called aref " my son,
my pupil, my brother, " the two chiefs were soon quarreling . having
become master of iraq, kassem was in no mood to share the prize with
aref's other hero, egypt's nasser . ordered into exile as ambassador to
west germany, aref pulled a gun in kassem's presence but was disarmed
and finally condemned to death as a traitor . kassem changed the
sentence to life imprisonment and in 1961 sentimentally and imprudently
set aref free . insecurely in control, and subject to vituperative
attacks from nasser's radio cairo, kassem eagerly accepted the support
of iraq's well-organized communist party, wangled $800 million in arms
and economic aid from the soviet bloc, and voted the communist line in
the united nations . spartan cot . kassem's brief regime reads like a
case history in dangerous living . he savagely put down one abortive
revolt, narrowly escaped death in an assassination attempt in which his
arm and hand were shattered by bullets . understandably gun-shy, he
spent most of his time inside the defense ministry building, where he
slept on a spartan cot and watched suspiciously for trouble . there was
plenty of that . half of iraq's army was tied down by a rebellion of
the kurdish tribesmen north and east of mosul . kassem began to grow
suspicious of iraq's communists ; after a series of red-inspired
strikes, kassem jailed hundreds of reds and condemned to death 28
communist leaders . and always he had to fear disaffection in his own
army . he was promising even greater army purges when last week the
rebels struck . after more than ten hours of hard fighting, the defense
ministry was in ruins and kassem's disheartened defenders surrendered .
kassem was alive, but only for a little while . the rebel iraqi radio
announced that he had been " tried " on the spot, condemned and, at 90
minutes past noon the next day, stood against a wall and executed . at
the moment (though victories are often perishable in arab politics),
the revolt seemed an impressive triumph for egypt's nasser, even if he
had no direct hand in it . if so, there would be trouble for the
hard-pressed kings of jordan and saudi arabia, as well as for the
britishprotected sheiks of the persian gulf . " kassem has gone ; soon
kings saud and hussein will go too, " said a complacent egyptian in
cairo . but first, nasser's supporters were confident that the iraqi
coup would set off a succession of uprisings in neighboring syria,
which has already put down two pro-nasser revolts since breaking off
from egypt in 1961 .

hands on the top job in west germany, and can hardly wait for
chancellor konrad adenauer to retire as promised next fall . he has
shyly nudged der alte before, only to be rapped harshly on the knuckles
. last week erhard puffed up his chest and tried again . to a munich
newspaper, ludwig declared his willingness to take over right now . " i
would be ready to accept a call to the chancellorship if my party and
the bundestag so decided, " he announced, clearly hoping that others
felt as he did . after all, many of west germany's restive politicians
had been grumbling over charles de gaulle's courtship of der alte,
wondering whether the price of germany's new friendship treaty with
france was an unacceptable subservience to france, and whether it
required siding with the french against both britain and the u.s . no
support . but when erhard sat back to listen for the expected cries of
support, there was nothing but silence . he had overreached himself .
at the first cabinet meeting after erhard gave out his
readiness-to-serve interview, konrad adenauer simply smiled and agreed
with every complaint poor ludwig could think of . would the chancellor
flatly endorse britain's entry into the common market ? he demanded .
of course, adenauer agreed blandly . would adenauer declare that nato
and close relations with the u.s . were the basis of bonn's diplomacy
? naturally, smiled der alte . then came the clanger . would adenauer
disassociate himself from de gaulle's ideas of creating a third force
between east and west ? snapped der alte : of course not, no need
for it . de gaulle had never even discussed such thoughts with him ;
besides, west germany is opposed to such a policy . running out of
steam and questions erhard looked around the room for support from
foreign minister gerhard schroder and defense minister kai-uwe von
hassel . they, like erhard, are probritish, and like erhard, have grave
reservations about adenauer's comradeship with de gaulle . but neither
was prepared to bring down the government ; schroder found a sudden
fascination in his thumbnails ; von hassel shuffled papers . neglected
conscience . next day, at a caucus of the ruling christian democrats
and their allies, adenauer chided erhard mercilessly for presuming to
seek control of the government . when the cabinet finally voted on
adenauer's demand that the franco-german pace be ratified immediately,
erhard's nein was overwhelmingly defeated . for the chancellor, there
was now only the bundestag to be dealt with . konrad adenauer, 87,
handled the situation with deft ease . the franco-german treaty " is
not a substitute for european integration, " he told the assembled
legislators . " it is merely one of the essential prerequisites . " as
a matter of fact, declared der alte, de gaulle " promised me that the
first subject of joint consultation after the treaty goes into effect
will be british entry " into the common market . as for the atlantic
alliance, " europe knows that it cannot defend itself without the
support of the united states . i underline again our repeatedly
expressed intention of organizing our defense in the framework of nato
/ ludwig erhard sat silent throughout adenauer's performance, showed no
emotion even when der alte turned to the economic matters which are
erhard's speciality and said : " chancellor erhard will . . . i mean
minister erhard . . . " both sides of the house dissolved in laughter as
adenauer permitted himself a rare grin . " malicious critics will think
i did that on purpose, " he said . " but i assure you i did not . well,
maybe having a laugh in the middle of such a boring government
statement is a good thing . " at week's end, erhard was right where he
had always been, groping for the top rung of the ladder . and konrad

likable sort, as soviet diplomats go . he was a good talker, an
enthusiastic partygoer and a back-slapping practical joker who often
laced his guests' beer with vodka, guffawing when they caught on . but
amiable ivan was more than a spoofer . he was also a spy . his
escapades began early in 1961, when he met a trim young woman
identified only as " miss x " at the zoo in sydney's taronga park and
recruited her as a soviet agent . she seemed willing, but to test her
trustworthiness, he conducted a couple of tests, feeding her money $592
in all and handing her minor assignments . once she had to pick up a
small cylinder concealed in a water meter ; another time she found one
hidden in the iron railing of a stairway . the black cross . skripov
then sent her a letter written in invisible ink and signed " theresa .
/ with chemical capsules furnished by skripov, miss x brought the
writing out, learned that she was to pick up a parcel concealed under a
tombstone in a cemetery, " the third from the one with a black cross
with the letters ihs . " convinced by now that miss x was trustworthy,
he handed her a big job . she was to deliver a paper-wrapped parcel to
a man in adelaide who would identify himself with a password . what
skripov did not know was that miss x had been working for australian
intelligence all along, and she simply turned the parcel over to
government agents . inside they found coded transmission timetables for
a soviet radio station, along with a small, high-speed radio message
sender . after waiting two anxious months for miss x to carry out her
task, skripov last week learned what had gone wrong . the australian
government sent a note to the embassy ordering him out of the country
in seven days for having made " elaborate preparations for espionage .

parliament voted secretly last week to name a new labor party leader,
they did so for the first time in eleven years with some confidence
that they might also be picking britain's next prime minister . the
prospect seemed to have influenced the voting considerably . in the
first round of electing a successor to the late hugh gaitskell, harold
wilson, 46, last week won an unexpectedly handsome lead over his two
opponents . he got 115 votes ; gaitskell's deputy, acting leader
george brown, an early favorite, got 88 ; and a third candidate, james
callaghan, who was automatically eliminated, got 41 . only eight votes
short of the outright majority needed for victory on the first ballot,
wilson became an odds-on favorite to defeat brown in this week's runoff
. in voting for portly, pipe-puffing wilson, a onetime oxford don who
draws most of his support from the left and was one of hugh gaitskell's
archrivals, labor m.p.s apparently had in mind not his ruthless
opportunism but the fact that he, like gaitskell, is a middle-class
intellectual . by contrast with earthy george brown, a blunt, diligent
anti-communist with strong union support, many laborites believe that
harold wilson will have more appeal for middle-class voters, who
have become increasingly disenchanted with prime minister harold
macmillan . an effective president of the
board of trade for 3f years in the
last labor government, wilson, at 31,
was the youngest cabinet minister
appointed in 165 years .

always daydreaming about life outside russia, sasha started collecting
foreign stamps and writing to collectors in other countries . as his
pen pals began telling him about the good things on the other side of

subversives and labor agitators opposed to singapore's inclusion, with
malaya and britain's borneo dependencies of sarawak, brunei and north
borneo, in a proposed malaysian federation of 10 million people . as
malaysia's birth date draws nearer, indonesia's president sukarno is
doing all he can to prevent it . his government continually blusters
about intervening militarily in british borneo . authorities in
singapore feared that local communists might try to sabotage british
bases on the island in order to hamper british retaliation in borneo .
sukarno is also making muscles against malaya, which would be the
dominant state in the new federation . djakarta has excluded malayan
fishermen from their traditional fishing grounds off the coast of
sumatra . an indonesian gunboat recently sank a fully laden rubber
barge inside malayan territorial waters . indonesia knows that a
pro-western, anti-communist federation would put a serious crimp in
sukarno's ambition to absorb oil-rich brunei and its two neighbors . he
also is anxious as usual for an issue to deflect mounting public
criticism over indonesia's growing economic crisis . fearing that
sukarno is itching to start something, malaya's prime minister tunku
(prince) abdul rahman appealed to london for reinforcements . the
british obligingly put 2,000 crack troops on a 72-hour alert to
reinforce its southeast asia forces, because of " the possibility of
outside interference . " the philippines are also covetous of north
borneo . at a meeting in london, the philippines maintained that in
1878 the filipino sultan of sulu had only " leased " north borneo to
the british and that the land actually still belonged to the filipino
government . behind the claim is the fear that malaysia would not be
able to prevent leftists in the federation and in indonesia from making
north borneo a communist enclave hard by the philippines' outer islands

malaysia, stiffly rejected the philippine claim, gave notice that it

fountain, conceived in 1630 by architect giovanni bernini, and built
more than 100 years later, chiefly by nicola salvi . hollywood added to

japan noose or pneumonia ?, one day in 1948, a well dressed
middle aged man walked into a branch of tokyo's teikoku bank
wearing the armband of a municipal official . claiming that he was a
city health inspector, the man ordered the bank manager to summon all
his employees so that he could give them a dose of anti-dysentery
medicine . the employees gulped the potion, then collapsed in agony .
from the open vaults, the medicine man grabbed about $185 in cash and
disappeared into the street . behind him, twelve people lay dead of
cyanide poisoning . then began the hunt . from witnesses, artists drew
a composite picture of the robber . eight month after the robbery,
police finally nabbed a prime suspect : a 57-year-old professional
painter named sadamichi hirasawa . hirasawa first admitted his guilt,
then retracted the confession . he was tried, convicted, and sentenced
to hang . two out of 40 . last week, eight years after his last appeal
was denied, hirasawa, now 72, was still in jail under a death sentence
japanese artists, writers and intellectuals have rallied to his
support and lawyers have protested against the severity of the sentence
. " it seems to me, " says one former tokyo magistrate, " that the
evidence was pretty flimsy . " the judge might have a point . hirasawa
insisted that the repudiated confession was extracted from him by
torture in a brutal nonstop interrogation . later, the painter's two
sons-in-law claimed that he was playing cards with them at the time of
the robbery . only two of the 40 eyewitnesses of the crime positively
identified hirasawa as the robber and both were increasingly unsure as
the trial wore on . the only clue pointing to hirasawa was the calling
card of the supposed health inspector, which the robber had left behind
in the bank ; handwriting experts determined that the writing on the
back of the card was hirasawa's . the painter never denied that he
once had the card, but claimed that it had been stolen from him when
his wallet was pickpocketed shortly before the robbery . painting in
the death house three japanese appellate courts have upheld the
original
verdict, but the rapid turnover of justice ministers in ten cabinet
reshuffles since 1955 has helped keep hirasawa alive . " if their
hearts were in it, they could have read the record and signed the death
warrant long ago,  says one former japanese judge . but they were
afraid, and i would be, too . " hirasawa has applied for a new trial,
but his application has no legal staying force on the order of
execution . to focus attention on his case, hirasawa's supporters
arranged for an exhibition of 50  of the 480 tempera paintings that he
has turned out in his 15 years in the death house . hirasawa's backers
have also circulated copies of the original composite newspaper drawing
of the robber in hopes of turning up new suspects . last november state
officials moved the painter from tokyo prison to remote, unheated
miyagi detention house in northern japan where all japanese executions
are carried out . " he was moved up there to die, but not by hanging, /
says one of his supporters . " the government hopes he'll die up there
faster of natural causes, because miyagi is cold and unhealthy . that

name on the world's front pages . a smallish, dark-skinned man with
gentle eyes and a fringelike beard, he led his riff tribesmen in the
last romantic war of this century . in the u.s., the vision of krim's
snow-white turban, flowing djellabah and spirited arabian steed was put
to music by sigmund romberg in broadway's the desert song . in north
africa, his tenacious struggle against the armies of france and spain
sent a throb of nationalism through the arab world . closed cave . born
in the riff mountains of northern morocco, educated at a spanish school
in melilla, a quiet employee of the spanish moroccan administration
until he was 38, krim became a rebel when the spanish broke the peace
with the riff tribesmen by seizing the holy city of xauen . in the
subsequent fighting, krim was captured and his father killed . escaping
from the spanish prison in melilla krim broke his leg and ever after
walked with a pronounced limp . gaining the safety of the mountains, he
rallied the riffs for a jihad against spain and in 1921 won an
extraordinary victory at anoual, capturing a spanish general and 20,000
soldiers most of whom were butchered on the spot . in the next four
years, krim repeatedly whipped the spaniards and nearly drove them into
the sea . when krim declared the independence of the riff and named
himself sultan, spain set up a puppet ruler of its own, the redoubtable
moroccan bandit raisuli. krim promptly scattered another spanish army,
seized raisuli and shut him up in a cave with his harem until he died .
arrogant in victory, krim next challenged the french and was finally
overwhelmed by a combined franco-spanish army of 300,000 men led by
marshal henri petain, which blasted his mountain strongholds with
artillery and bombs until krim at last surrendered in may 1926 . the
spanish army, one of whose officers was generalissimo francisco franco,
wanted krim executed, but the french mor gallantly shipped him off to
exile on reunion island in the indian ocean . there, consoled by his
two favorite wives and a monthly pension . krim
languished for 21 years . in 1947 france relented and let krim board a
ship for the riviera, where he would be under house arrest . the
65-year-old rebel jumped ship as it was passing through the suez canal,
and was granted political asylum in egypt . spurned fortune . in cairo,
under nasser's protection, krim worked with other north african exiles
for the independence of tunisia, algeria and morocco . but he was
disgusted by the terms on which freedom was won ; he claimed they were
too favorable to france . his francophobia deepened with the years, and
in 1957 he warned the u.s . against relying on france to defend europe,
adding querulously : " i don't know why the world doesn't catch on to
those french they're stupid, weak, stubborn and selfish . " after
morocco won its independence, king mohammed v tried to placate the old
exile and persuade him to return home . he sent donation of $14,000,
but krim refused the money and threw away the royal letter because it
addressed him as a plain subject, not  a prince in recent years abd el

rheumatism, failing sight and heart disease, and listening grumpily to

in dagga weed (marijuana) and take out gold stolen by workmen in
rhodesian mines . last week the harried border guards had a new chore
: to prevent the smuggling of hops into southern rhodesia . at
beitbridge, on the limpopo river, a customs officer dutifully searched
the luggage of a vacationer returning from south africa, then
whispered, " man, what does a hop look like ? no one here has ever
seen one ! " the hop crisis results from a $28 duty on every pound of
imported hops imposed by the government of sir roy welensky because tax
revenue from commercial beer has not been up to expectations . " this
is due to the spread of home brewing, " complained the government .
home brewers are generally respectable citizens, ranging from railroad
engineers and civil servants to bank clerks and garage mechanics men
who find commercial beer too extravagant for their budgets . the new
duty would make home brew twice as costly as the commercial stuff .
quickly forming a pressure group grandly named the amateur brewers &
vintners association, some 300 do-it-yourself braumeisters fired off a
protest to welensky, pointing out that home brewing " has taken place

france the life of one man the shaking up that the
atlantic alliance got last month was the work of a single man . and
france's claim to dominate western europe and to be reckoned with as
the leader of a third force is also the lengthening extension of that
man . those of his allies who have to deal with le grand charles
sometimes find that their exasperation exceed their admiration . but
any way one looks at it, whether as an ally or as a frenchman worrying
about the chaos that might follow his death, there is a lot riding on
the towering man in the elysee palace . he is 72, and he has enemies
desperate enough to want to kill him . last week, as frenchmen closely
followed the news of a trial of would-be assassins of de gaulle, the
government announced a fresh attempt on de gaulle's life . armored car
. the night before de gaulle was to inspect the ecole militaire on the
left bank near the eiffel tower, paris gendarmes swarmed over the
ground, searching the buildings for weapons and interrogating officer
students and teachers . de gaulle showed up next day on schedule, but
(in a concession to danger rare for him) cooped up inside an armored
citroen limousine with bulletproof windows . according to the official
story from surete headquarters on the rue des saussaies, police had
discovered a plot on a civilian's tip, in the nick of time . after
interrogating the five suspects, the police indicated that the
triggerman was navy captain robert poinard, 37, who was held for
questioning along with his blonde young wife . according to the police
supposition, captain poinard was to use a carbine with a telescopic
sight to kill de gaulle while he was inspecting the honor guard in the
cobbled ecole militaire courtyard . two other officers were also in
custody, but the oddest of the suspects was the alleged ringleader, mme
. paule rousselot de liffiac, 55, a pipe-smoking, low-salaried english
translator at the school, the mother of six children, who was picked up
at her 15-room, 18th century chateau in a town south of lyon . the
ecole militaire, where napoleon learned to soldier, is the top academy
for the french military, and a hotbed of antigaullism among the
veterans of algeria who think he let them down . shrewd delay . algeria
was a word much spoken also in a courtroom in suburban vincennes, where
nine would-be assassins were on trial for having tried to kill de
gaulle last august in an ambuscade at petit-clamart, a paris suburb .
as has so often happened in france since the dreyfus case of the 1890s,
the trial was not confined to pertinent evidence but blossomed into a
national political affair . very few frenchmen had much sympathy for
the defendants, but many had grave doubts about how they were being
tried . de gaulle's chosen instrument for the trial was the special
court of military justice, from whose verdict there is no appeal, which
was set up last year and was to end its existence on feb . 25 . the
defendants' attorneys shrewdly tried to delay proceedings until that
date so that the case would have to start all over again in a regular
court, from which appeals could be taken . but de gaulle moved to fit
the law to his needs.his cabinet swiftly approved a bill extending the
life of the special court of military justice, and the bill was passed
by de gaulle's assembly 271-170 (the senate last week stubbornly voted
the bill down but, like britain's house of lords, is powerless to
overturn decisions of the lower house .
the defendants at vincennes were an odd,
and oddly frightening, lot . most of them were slack-jawed youths who
seemed equally lacking in confidence and intelligence . one was an army
lieutenant with the old, aristocratic breton name of bougrenet de la
tocnaye, and a head reeling with heroic memories of his family's feats
of arms dating back to the crusades . the leader, lieut . colonel
jean-marie bastien-thiry, 35, who had graduated from the famed
polytechnique and served as a brilliant air force engineer, revealed
himself as a man who put great industry, intelligence and logic to work
within a framework of mad zeal . all nonsense . though refusing to
recognize the jurisdiction of the court, bastien-thiry agreed to answer
questions, " because it is necessary for the french people to know why
we have acted and how we have acted . " his story was fantastic,
incredible, and thoroughly french . to begin with, explained
bastien-thiry, the ambush had not been intended to kill de gaulle, only
to capture him . to this end, the assassins who were all " crack shots
/ had fired at the tires of de gaulle's car . as a witness for the
prosecution, de gaulle's son-in-law, colonel alain de boissieu, who was
riding beside the chauffeur, testified that he saw a man pouring a
stream of bullets at the car, and recalled, " he did not seem to be
aiming his submachine gun at the tires, but quite obviously at the
passengers . " to the chauffeur, boissieu snapped, " down the middle .
straight ahead ! " then he turned around, begged de gaulle, who was
still sitting upright, to bend down . de gaulle obliged by leaning
forward slightly . defendant bastien-thiry airily dismissed as "
technical incidents " the additional evidence that the car windows were
shattered by bullets, a motorcycle cop's helmet drilled through, and de
gaulle's head missed only by inches . if they had captured de gaulle,
the conspirators intended to hide him away in a villa " between paris
and versailles, " and planned to prevent his escaping by removing his
spectacles and suspenders . after several weeks, de gaulle would be
tried by the national council of the resistance (the successor to the
algerian secret army organization), and presumably executed . with de
gaulle disposed of, the national council of the resistance planned to
appoint a new head of state : none other than de gaulle's present
finance minister valery giscard d'estaing . giscard d'estaing said it
was all nonsense, that he had never even met bastien-thiry and had no
links with either the secret army or the council of the resistance .
the wild rhetoric of the defendants could not conceal the implacable
determination to kill . la gloire summons frenchmen in many directions
. five of the gunmen who took part in the petit-clamart ambush are
still at large, including the most dangerous of all, georges watin, 39,
nicknamed boiteux (the limper), who the police say was also the brains
behind the ecole militaire plot . a french cabinet minister, emerging
from a meeting at the elysee palace last week, said worriedly to a

with all arab states, and the " overcoming of all the difficulties
facing the iraqi people . " but he was mysteriously silent about the
size or membership of the all-powerful national council of the
revolutionary command, which organized and led the revolt against
kassem . no personalities . said aref : " this is a secret which must
remain a secret for many reasons . " asked why, englishspeaking aref
replied volubly in arabic . pressed again for an answer, aref suddenly
announced, " the conference is closed, " and departed, surrounded by
his guards . the reason for such secrecy seems to be a general
revulsion against the selfglorification of kassem's four-year
dictatorship . " we revolted against the cult of personality, "
explained new foreign minister talib hussein shabib, 32 . to the key
question of who is boss of the new iraq, the answer seems to be : at
the moment, no one man . president aref cannot make major decisions

visible was the new 21-man cabinet, and most western observers liked
what they saw . said one : " in general, they're a topnotch bunch of
responsible, eager, exceptionally well-educated people . " many of the
ministers have lived or have been educated in the west, ranging from
foreign minister shabib, who graduated from london university and is
married to an englishwoman, to finance minister salih kubba, who
attended the university of california and has an international
reputation as an economist . seven of the new cabinet ministers were in
kassem's concentration camp at rashid military base until the rebels
broke down the gates during the coup . the baath idea . the new
government is clearly anti-communist, and all but five ministers are
either members of or closely linked to the baath (renaissance) party .
more an idea than an ideology, the basic baath doctrine insists that "
there are no arab nations ; there is only one arab nation . " this
creed is, of course, warmly embraced by egypt's gamal abdel nasser, but
aref and iraq's baath party seem hardly eager to fall under cairo's
domination . the baathist leaders in iraq, in fact, have reshaped their
doctrine of arab unity into a concept of federation of arab states
without a centralized dictatorship . this could mean anything,
including a revival of the old concept of loose unity in the " fertile
crescent " iraq, syria, jordan and lebanon . already syria, having
broken free from nasser, was proposing federation to iraq's new leaders
. the ideas of the new iraqis seem liberal, humane and democratic . but
so did kassem's program when he first seized power ; his reign swiftly
drifted to brutality and degradation . normal torpor . by week's end
iraq seemed settling down into the normal torpor of an arab state after
a coup d'etat . oil flowed uninterruptedly through the pipelines to the
mediterranean . shops, schools, and government offices reopened . the
curfew was gradually extended from 3 in the afternoon until 11 at
night, and in the coffeehouses men were gossiping and playing
backgammon .
the local communists, the
only group still supporting the discredited kassem regime, were being
stridently urged by moscow's powerful arabic voice in east germany to "
struggle against the fascist imperialist regime now foisted on iraq . "
some communists responded by sniping from rooftops, but their
organization had suffered a devastating blow . hundreds of the dogged
men with green armbands, carrying mimeographed lists of red leaders
complete with home addresses and auto license numbers, methodically
hunted down the communists, who had grown strong in kassem's final
months . by last week the new regime had killed or jailed nearly 2,500
dissident communists . this was enough to win the applause of western
diplomats . but anyone who had witnessed the perilous passage of other,
earlier revolts with laudable ambitions, could only hope that the
rebels would stop the shooting and start running the country . in the
long run, guns will hardly serve the new regime better than they served
abdul karim kassem .

great britain 2-12 the other harold the labor party last week chose a
new leader to carry its banner against the tories in britain's coming
general election . the winner : harold wilson, 46, a pipe-smoking
intellectual with a phenomenal memory, a following of mixed admirers,
and a love of political combat . wilson's  victory was a crushing blow
to his chief rival, comradely george brown, 48, a staunch trade
unionist and ex-truck driver, who as acting party leader since the
death last month of hugh gaitskell, had every reason to believe that he
would inherit the mantle of leadership . but when the voting began last
week, it was george brown's old friends among labor's trade unionists
who abandoned him first . some opposed his pro-common market views ;
others among labor's intellectual center and right flinched at the
thought of a workingclass, up-from-the-ranks prime minister, and
preferred to go to the country with an oxford graduate and economics
don like wilson . respectability means a lot to the labor party . high
mortality . " no one knows harold, really, " says a friend . but at a
press conference last week, jammed with reporters and tv cameras,
wilson set out smoothly and competently to leave the right impression .
he regretted the " tragic event " of gaitskell's death " that created
this vacancy . " he diplomatically declared that " a great deal of
credit must go to george brown " for keeping the party together in the
interim . finally, wilson stated his three main objectives : " first,
to maintain the unity of the party that hugh gaitskell handed on ;
second, to continue those policies worked out under his leadership . . .
thirdly, to lead the party to victory in the coming general election .
/ in the past decade, labor's strength has been sapped by internal
bickering and by the loss of many of its ablest men (gaitskell, sir
stafford cripps, ernest bevin, aneurin bevan) . the feuding has faded,
and labor finds itself in the best shape in years to topple the
government of prime minister harold macmillan . a gallup poll last week
indicated that labor had a 15f per cent lead over the conservatives,
the lowest the tories have been in eleven years in power . beveridge's
boy . deepening unemployment and a faltering economy account more for
tory unpopularity than its recent defeat on the common market .
macmillan has until fall 1964 to call an election at the time most
advantageous to himself . much will depend on the skill with which
wilson exploits tory weaknesses and demonstrates labor's right to
govern . the son of an industrial chemist, james harold wilson was born
march 11, 1916, in the heart of industrial yorkshire, and spent his
childhood in a hillside village overlooking the factory smoke of the
colne valley . at the local council school, he won the first of a
series of scholarships that eventually carried him to oxford's jesus
college, where he was a leading member of the debating society and a
cross-country runner . graduating with first class honors, wilson
remained at oxford as an economics don until the war, ending up in the
ministry of fuel and power . sir william beveridge employed him as a
researcher for his famed social insurance report, and called wilson a "
brilliant young man " and " the best economist i've ever had . " in
1945 wilson stood for office for the first time, and, in the election
that threw winston churchill out of office, won a lancashire seat
handily by 7,022 votes . two years later, when wilson became president
of the board of trade at 31, he was the youngest cabinet member since
william pitt . littered house . among his constituents or at his
red-brick home in hampstead garden suburb, wilson is affable, easygoing
and well-liked . his wife mary, the daughter of a baptist minister,
writes poetry and is active in her local church ; his two sons, robin,
19, and giles, 14, litter the house with sports gear and mackintoshes .
but in the house of commons, the reaction to wilson is generally one of
uneasy suspicion, and he is frequently accused of being " slippery . "
as the economist put it last week, " on the big things defense, the
american alliance, east-west, the need to give labor a twentieth
century look mr . wilson has been consistently ambiguous, indeed
deliberately and cleverly so . these are the reasons for more than
doubt about his leadership . " having quit the labor cabinet in 1951,
along with firebrand aneurin bevan, wilson has inherited much of
bevan's leftwing support . but in the cabinet his main administrative
achievement was the dismantling of a vast array of controls on
britain's postwar economy . he has always been more pragmatic than
doctrinaire or opportunistic, his enemies say . in a commons speech
last week he declared, " what i am saying may or may not be
ideological, but it will get the export orders . " with the left safely
on his side, wilson is shrewd enough to know that, as leader, he must
now conciliate the party's center and right . wilson carried on a mild
flirtation with the h-bomb " unilateralists " when he challenged
gaitskell for party leadership in 1960, and for a time plumped for
neutralism instead of nato . last week wilson reassured everybody that
the labor party " stands firmly by nato . " and he added, " we should
expect to have a very happy relationship " with washington . in a
recent commons speech he argued that britain should avoid the needless
expense of a separate nuclear deterrent, but nevertheless should have a
voice in deciding when the west (i.e., the u.s.) uses its nuclear power
: " there must be no annihilation without representation ! " with
his ready tongue and sharp mind, harold wilson will prove a formidable
adversary for prime minister harold macmillan (he was swiftly dubbed "
the other harold " ) . there is hardly an m.p . who has a better grasp
of parliamentary procedure or a better knack of turning it to his
side's advantage . he has already drawn blood with his slashing attacks
on the " vain nuclear posturing " of the macmillan government .
macmillan's relations with u.s . president john kennedy, said wilson,
reminded him of a " seedy uncle " receiving homilies from a young and
wealthy nephew . though it may be difficult to discover precisely where
harold wilson stands, there was little doubt last week about where he
intends to come to rest at 10 downing street .

hungary gay until tomorrow like germany's riotous fasching
festival, hungary's farsang was traditionally a time to blow off steam
before the onset of lent's rigors . it was banned by hungary's red
rulers . but now, with their tolerance, farsang (pronounced forshong),
is making a comeback not so much as a pre-lenten spree as a chance to
escape the austerity of everyday life under communism . explained one
blonde merrymaker : " we celebrate from the morning after new year's
right through lent, and on to easter . " hungary's festival pales by
comparison with the old days, when magyar aristocrats would spit on a
100-forint note (worth about $12.50), slap it on a gypsy's forehead,
and demand passionate violinplaying until the spittle dried and the
note fell off . but all things considered, it is gay enough . at
budapest's press ball last week, young men in stovepipe trousers and
girls in daringly decollete dresses performed a writhing twist that
onlookers pointed to with a touch of pride as their own " dirty twist .
/ for the monster masked balls that punctuate the season, probably
100,000 costumes will be rented . at some events the men sport tuxedos
rented for 120 forints (the average hungarian earns 1,600 forints a
month, or $70 at tourist exchange rates), and the ladies wear old
remodeled party dresses . everybody throws a party : there is even a
ball of the administration of water economy . at the foresters' ball in
budapest's hotel gellert fortnight ago, 1,500 guests turned up,
including even a few foresters . gypsies provide the music, sawing out
strauss waltzes, wild hungarian csardas and songs by somebody listed as
/ colporter . " the balls go strong until dawn breaks over the danube .
for all the dancing, drinking and casual lovemaking, the festival has a
bittersweet air . after their night-long revels, budapest's residents
pick their way to work along pock-marked sidestreets, gaze absently at
the stripped-bark scaffolding on buildings gutted by soviet tanks
during the 1956 rebellion, queue up for the consumer goods that always
seem to be in short supply . the red army still stays prudently hidden
in its camps ringing budapest, and the hated avh secret police have
been replaced by a less conspicuously murderous bunch known as bkh, but
nobody is enthusiastic about the " permissiveness " shown lately by
premier janos kadar . don't let all this gaiety
fool you, " a budapest writer warned an american visitor after a
farsang ball . " the young people are gay because they are young . the
old people they are gay because they don't know what comes tomorrow . "

italy off & running for italy's 243 elected senators and 596
deputies, all roads led out of rome last week . getting the jump on the
presidential decree formally dissolving parliament, the politicians
scurried home to start campaigning in the first general election in
five years . if the april 28-29 election were only a personal
popularity contest, short (5 ft . 1 in.), mustachioed premier amintore
fanfani, 55, might find himself out of a job . fanfani is shrewd, not
simpatico ,; behind his back, critics call him and his aides i
bassotti (the dachshunds) . more than fanfani's looks and cold
political style are against him . a 6 per cent jump in living costs
last year touched off a prolonged wave of strikes by industrial and
whitecollar workers ; fortnight ago, 5,000,000 workers quit their jobs
in a one-day general walkout . fanfani's year-old partnership with
pietro nenni's left-wing socialists, the apertura a sinistra (opening
to the left), has sharply divided the premier's own christian
democratic party ; the coalition's major legislative accomplishment
the needless and expensive nationalization of the electrical industry,
which was nenni's price for collaboration has turned many businessmen
against the government . still, fanfani figures to stay on top . of the
six nations in the common market, italy's estimated 6 per cent growth
rate this year is the highest ; at about 1,000,000, unemployment is
half the 1956 level . many italians fear that flirtation with that old
stalin prizewinner pietro nenni will eventually lead italy down the
path to neutralism . but so far, nenni has pulled to the right in
international affairs, away from his longtime communist allies . he has
even halfheartedly endorsed a nato nuclear force . nenni was probably
saved a little socialistic embarrassment when the u.s . recently agreed
to pull its jupiter missiles out of italy .

east germany the harder they fall east german communists
forever accuse west german chancellor konrad adenauer of harboring
former nazis in his government, but last week, to their acute
embarrassment, a prominent exnazi turned up right among east germany's
top twelve communists . the man was professor dr . karl-heinz bartsch,
39, a brilliant agriculturalist who in scarcely more than a decade
soared from complete obscurity to a spot in walter ulbricht's cabinet .
first gaining prominence with his lectures on animal husbandry at east
berlin's humboldt university, bartsch was given a job controlling
collective farms, soon was made deputy minister of agriculture .
perhaps he did not tell his colleagues of some of his earlier
achievements : a place in the hitlerjugend at nine, hitler's cross of
danzig at 16 (presumably for deeds in poland), a war career in the
notorious ss . western intelligence agencies knew all about bartsch,
however . his name had turned up in the berlin documents center, an
archive of old nazi membership files rescued from the storage heap of a
west german papermill after the war . resisting the temptation to spill
the facts on bartsch, intelligence bided its time . fortnight ago, the
rising herr bartsch became agricultural czar, and at this point out to
west berlin newspapers went full dossiers on the new communist cabinet
minister . for two days the east german government ignored the
headlines . then ulbricht's party control committee met and decided
that bartsch, for causing " serious damage " to the party, would be
dismissed from all his party and government functions . he had been in
office just 36 hours .

central africa no squawks, please everybody was rushing to leave
sir roy welensky's rickety rhodesia federation . black-ruled nyasaland
was already assured of britain's permission to secede . northern
rhodesia's african-dominated assembly last week voted, 21 to 14, to
demand immediate secession . even whiteruled southern rhodesia was now
calling for " a clean break . " or, as the new prime minister, winston
field, put it at the opening session of parliament in salisbury, " the
question of southern rhodesian secession will not arise . we shall have
been seceded from . " britain's deputy prime minister r . a . ( " rab "
) butler had just spent two weeks in the rhodesias, and concluded that
a breakup of the ten-year-old federation was inevitable . sometime in
the coming spring, butler is expected to call a conference in london to
overhaul the constitu tion of northern rhodesia, and give the region
the right to secede ; he also hoped that he might salvage from the
federation's wreckage some kind of economic link between the two
rhodesias . field's aim is to win independence for southern rhodesia
before britain has a chance to draft a new constitution that would
assure southern rhodesia's 3,616,000 black of majority rule over the
221,000 whites . field wants no squawks from native agitators while he
tries to bring off his plan . this month his police arrested african
nationalist leader joshua nkomo and seven other former leaders of the
banned zimbabwe african people's union for taking part in an " illegal
procession " and " obstructing police " at a protest rally, charges
that could mean up to ten years in prison . with that, field last week
sent parliament a spate of proposals that would give police broad new
search and arrest powers, permit the whipping of prisoners (up to a
maximum of ten lashes), and make hanging mandatory for anyone convicted
of arson or the use of explosives .

south africa unhappy apart prime minister hendrik verwoerd's
grandiose scheme to transplant most of south africa's 11 million
natives into nine back-country, all-black bantustans was supposed to
put an end to the country's racial unrest . instead, it has only
increased the dangerous tension between black and white . the first
bantustan on verwoerd's list was the transkei, a denmark-size (16,500
sq . mi.) area of eroded farm land on the indian ocean . nobody knows
the troubles it has seen . ever since africans went on a rampage there
more than two years ago, murdering the government's handpicked tribal
chiefs and setting fire to entire villages, mobile police patrols armed
with sten guns, armored cars, and helicopter spotter planes have had to
stay on duty in parts of the transkei . fortnight ago, a white family
of four were capriciously hacked to death with pangas as they stumbled
down the steps of their burning trailer, set afire while parked on a
road only 30 miles from the transkei's capital of umtata . last week,
as the parliament in cape town prepared to debate a bill legally
establishing the transkei bantustan certain to pass the nationalist
party-controlled legislature, probably by june there was more trouble .
the government plans to make kaizer matanzima, a mission-educated tembu
chief, the chief minister of the new transkei government . the
bodyguard of a headman serving matanzima got into a tribal fight with
40 warriors armed with spears and axes . matanzima quickly mustered 500
men to crush the revolt, and south african police stood by with a
truckload of men and a helicopter . the rebels fled into the hills .
police blamed the trailer murders and the tribal outbreak on the
increasing influence of poqo (pronounced paw-kaw), an african terrorist
society whose members, like kenya's notorious mau mau, take secret
oaths and are heavily influenced by witch doctors . poqo fanatics
recently tried to assassinate matanzima because he frankly favors
apartheid as " the best solution " for south africa's racial troubles .
matanzima's powers to govern the transkei's 1,400,000 blacks, 15,000 to
20,000 whites, and 14,000 coloreds will be strictly limited . all
measures passed by the local legislature of tribal chiefs and elected
representatives are subject to veto by the central government ; cape
town still will control justice and internal security . money to
improve the barren region will be lacking . verwoerd has promised an
annual budget subsidy of $30 million, but this falls far short of
meeting the need for housing, schools, land reclamation, establishing
new industry . in addition, matanzima faces powerful political
opposition from another tembu chief, sabata dalindyebo, who does not
like the bantustan idea at all . dalindyebo demands multiracial
political rule " in which the color of a man's skin plays no part in
his civil rights . by accepting self-government, " he warns, " we fear
we will be enclosing ourselves in a pigsty .

burma army socialism ever since general ne win tossed bumbling
premier u nu out of office last march, the only thing that has kept him
from rushing headlong into a program of industrial nationalization and
farm collectivization has been the influence of tough, handsome

with leftist members in the 17-man revolutionary council, aung gyi "
most respectfully " asked strongman ne win " to relieve me of the
various duties to which i have been assigned . " as army vice chief of
staff, minister of trade and industry, and chairman of the burma oil
co., aung gyi was ne win's no . 2 man and heir apparent . the son of a
well-to-do chinese textile merchant and a burmese woman, he proved
himself a canny diplomat both in the 1960 negotiations that fixed
burma's borders with red china and in last month's talks with japan
that produced $170 million in additional world war ii reparations and
loans . despite his insistence that " i have no training in economics,
/ he built a modest army px-type operation into the giant burma
economic development corp., running 34 firms ranging from banking to
fisheries and turning handsome profits that in some years ran as high
as $2,500,000 . though he insisted that he had been a socialist for 20
years and intended to remain one for 20 more, in fact, he was a
tough-minded pragmatist who openly advocated cooperation with private
industry . inevitably, aung gyi's gradualism annoyed ne win, a soldier
who is no communist but has vowed to socialize burma as quickly as
possible . aung gyi earned the enmity of brigadier tin pe, a marxist
theorist and a key member of the revolutionary council . for months,
tin pe pressed for a faster switchover to state control ; aung gyi's
departure means that tin pe has finally won out . stripped of power,
aung gyi, 43, flew off to voluntary exile in an isolated burmese
village near the borders of china and india . at least four
high-ranking officers who shared his views were arrested or forced into
retirement . with the opposition out of the way, ne win declared that

business, the rice trade and some private industries . burma's economy,

millions too, trying to win the hearts and minds of africa . sometimes,
moscow must wonder whether it is worth all the effort . in bulgaria,
200 african university students on communist scholarships marched down
sofia's lenin boulevard toward the office of premier todor zhivkov to
protest government restrictions . instead of sympathy, they were met by
600 bulgarian militiamen, who flailed the africans with clubs and
hauled them off to jail . all the students had asked for was permission
to maintain an all-africa student union . like other africans in
eastern europe, the 350 african students in bulgaria found more
segregation than brotherhood, more indoctrination than education .
after the riot, ghana's ambassador lodged a strong protest with the
bulgarian government, and just about all of the africans in sofia
decided to pack up and seek education elsewhere . " we have been
insulted in every possible way, " said ghanaian agricultural student
robert kotey as he arrived in vienna . " we were molested in the
streets, called " black monkeys' and " jungle people,' and peopled used
to spit out before us on buses and trains . " concluded ghanaian
economics student kofi buckle : " we soon realized that to study in a
communist country is a bloody waste of time . " in guinea, once
regarded as a foothold of soviet penetration of africa, russia's stock
fell to a new low with l'affaire svetlana . it had to do with a blonde
russian exchange teacher named svetlana ushakova . against embassy
instructions, she persisted in making friends with the natives, and
ignored orders that she return to russia . fortnight ago, she was
hustled to a moscow-bound plane, only to be rescued by the guineans
themselves . on a second vain attempt to get svetlana to moscow,
russia's ambassador to guinea himself tried to pass her off as the
aircraft's stewardess . then a few days later, the russian cultural
attache and two aides snatched svetlana from a conakry restaurant and
sped off toward the airport . that was too much . the guineans tossed

conferences the city of lost causes geneva is the
only city in the world to have gained fame and prosperity from
successive failures . this placid, tidy town lying on the shores of lac
leman and beneath mont blanc, the tallest of the alps, has been the
scene of some of humanity's most trying moments . it is a place where
great ideas turn to dust in the archives, and where nations exhausted
by war come to end their fighting . last week, like every week, geneva
resounded with the din of wrangling delegations . in another wearying
round of the nuclear test ban negotiations, the west refused to scale
down further its demands for on-site inspections, which stood at 20
annually three years ago, eight this winter, and seven last week . the
russians, who originally refused to permit any inspections, three years
agreed to " two or three, " and last week would not go higher . a
newsman who has covered geneva since 1947 says that habitual attendance
at east-west conferences results in a tendency to accept the arguments
of both sides : " you come to think that the russians object to
controls because they want to cheat, and the west insists on controls
because they want to spy in russia . you reach the conclusion that
everybody is equally wrong . " imposed deadline . a city of 182,000 and
the birthplace of jean jacques rousseau, as well as of the red cross,
geneva got into the conference business early . during the 16th
century, under reformer john calvin, geneva was the protestant rome .
in 1872 geneva's city hall was the headquarters of a five-man
commission that arbitrated a dispute between britain and the u.s . over
the damages caused by the british-built confederate raider alabama .
the luckless league of nations was established in geneva in 1920 .
after the league was erased by world war ii, the united nations took
over the vast palais des nations as its european base . geneva is to
diplomats what niagara falls is to honeymooners . every meeting of
every conference is filled to the brim with endless, multilingual talk
. only rarely does the palais, one of the world's largest office
buildings, come to life with such dramatic moments as emperor haile
selassie's moving speech against mussolini's invasion of ethiopia, or
the sight of french premier pierre mendes-france, watch in hand,
signing at 4 a.m . the accord ending the indo-china war to meet the
deadline he had set himself on taking office . 15 per cent jump . most
conference activity revolves around such annual fixtures as the world
health organization and the u.n . economic and social council . over
170 organizations have headquarters in geneva, ranging from the
international bureau of education to the world alliance of the y.m.c.a
. through much of february, 1,600 delegates from all corners of the
earth sat happily through long sessions of the united nations
conference on the application of science and technology for the benefit
of the less developed areas, a group known as uncscat for short .
meetings most often occur during
the good weather months, and usually afford sufficient time off for
delegates to enjoy the delights of mountain and beach . the permanent
u.n . employees in geneva lead a quiet, incestuous life made up of
intimate cocktail parties, small dinners and casual meetings in the
palais bar, which serves sandwiches so dismal that they are alleged to
be rejects from commercial airlines . the citizens of geneva, who are
mostly french-speaking swiss, ignore the permanent u.n . staff, the
delegates and the tourists, and devote themselves to making watches,
precision tools and, especially, money . an 18th-century french foreign
minister once advised a friend, " if you see a genevese jump out of a
window, jump right after him . there's 15 per cent to be gained . " but
as swiss cities go, which is slowly, geneva has a reputation for
wildness . in bern and zurich the sidewalks are rolled up at midnight,
but geneva's night spots can stay open until 4 a.m . police cannot
break into geneva hotel rooms and ask to see marriage licenses as they
can in most german swiss cities . geneva has only a few licensed
prostitutes but no susceptible visitor has ever been known to complain
of a lack of complaisant women . occasionally, there are criminal
activities . during the 1960 disarmament conference, sir michael
wright, chief british delegate, found a thief under his bed . and
cameroon's pro-communist politician, felix-roland moumie, died suddenly
after drinking four glasses of pernod that someone had spiked with rat
poison . poetic chef . the proprietors of geneva's 300 bars and 18
nightclubs, report that arab, south american and african delegates live
it up the most . communist bloc delegates usually remain dourly behind
the high stone walls of suburban villas . one popular bar, the navy
club, was founded by u.s . naval officers detailed to the 1954
indo-china peace conference . most restaurants are french and very good
; delegates who can afford it happily drive 30 miles to the fabulous
and expensive le pere bise, just across the frontier in france itself .
in geneva there are three chinese restaurants (one nationalist and two
red chinese), a vietnamese one whose chef is a poet, and even an arab
eating house, known fondly as chez farouk . for the athletic, geneva
boasts an american-run twelve-lane bowling alley, and for gamblers, two
casinos ; and for the prurient, there is a striptease joint called the
ba-ta-clan, whose huge red neon sign winks wickedly across from st .
pierre cathedral, where calvin delivered sermons laced with fire and
brimstone . for roues who want to keep going even after 4 a.m., a
second-floor establishment named the u.n . bridge club serves drinks
till dawn and polish love songs rendered by an italian barmaid .
unsigned treaty . despite the seeming aimlessness of most geneva
negotiations, there is a residue of idealism and optimism . last week
the british gave a farewell party for sir michael wright upon his
retirement as britain's chief nucleartalks representative . there was
an element of sadness, since sir michael had plainly hoped to end his
career by signing the east-west treaty . newsmen applauded warmly when
sir michael turned to his guest, senator hubert humphrey, and said, " i
hope your signature will be on the treaty . " if the treaty is ever
signed, geneva will have lost its present unwanted title of the " city
of lost causes . /

europe the outsiders in a geneva conference room borrowed from
the world meteorological organization, the seven members of the
european free trade association met last week to revive a marriage that
they would much rather have seen dissolved . until charles de gaulle's
rejection of britain's bid for common market membership, most of its
efta partners (sweden, norway, denmark, switzerland, austria, portugal)
had also banked on joining the six . instead, as they ruefully surveyed
the damage, the outer seven seemed farther out than ever . accepting
the fact, efta which was glued together in a defensive reaction to the
common market in 1960 decided last week to speed up its timetable for
internal tariff reduction in hopes of stimulating trade among its
members . the delegates disavowed any intention of starting a trade war

berlin 2-12 willy wins in municipal elections held at the darkest hour
of the berlin blockade in 1948, west berliners showed their defiance of
the reds by giving their beloved mayor, ernst reuter, a record 64.5
per cent of
the popular vote . communism's wall has done nothing to reduce their
solidarity . last week, urged on by posters that warned " whoever stays
at home votes for the wall, " 90 per cent of eligible west berliners
trudged through foggy, snowy streets to give able mayor willy brandt,
reuter's protege, a landslide victory for another term in office .
brandt's socialists got almost 62 per cent of the 1,571,820 votes cast
; in the workers' stronghold of wedding, the district which brandt
chose as his personal constituency, he won more than 75 per cent of the
ballots . citywide, the puny communist party lost one-third of its
support, attracting just a shade more than 1 per cent of the vote .
brandt's victory was no surprise, for west berlin traditionally votes
socialist . what was startling was the size of the socialist gain, and
the sharp loss suffered by the west berlin faction of chancellor konrad
adenauer's christian democratic union . c.d.u . deputy mayor franz
amrehn lost to a little-known socialist, and overall c.d.u . strength
in the berlin house of representatives dropped 25 per cent . there
were, of course, local issues, but no one doubted that the c.d.u .
suffered from the tarnished image of adenauer's national party, which
has been slipping in local and state elections . recent discontent
focuses on the government's clumsy " treason " crackdown on the
newsmagazine der spiegel last november, and more important, on the
stubborn refusal of adenauer to clear the way for his own retirement
and choice of a new c.d.u . leader . with new national elections due in
1965, it is none too early for the christian democrats to start
building up a new candidate, whether he turns out to be vice chancellor
ludwig erhard, the fastrising foreign minister gerhard schroder, or one
of the party's dark horses . as for a socialist candidate for the
chancellorship, willy brandt, who was beaten once by adenauer, was sure
to be it again . and willy was willing .  " my work might be more
needed elsewhere, " he said .

west germany tanks, but no tanks among the many high-sounding
but vague provisions sprinkled through the franco-german reconciliation
treaty ceremonially signed in paris six weeks ago was one calling for
joint research and development of conventional weapons . this seemed a
promising clause, for experts from both nations already had spent years
working together on various projects e.g., antitank rockets developed
at the french ballistic proving grounds at st.louis, a big military
transport plane designed to operate off short runways, a
french-designed heavy helicopter . but the most important joint project
in the works was the europa panzer, a medium tank ; when first
conceived, the idea was that it would replace the west german
bundeswehr's 2,000 out-of-date u.s . m-47s and m-48s, give the french
army a fast, quick-firing, maneuverable weapon . but there were snags
in the europa panzer scheme . the germans, sold on the idea of a safer,
cheaper multifuel engine, which works best on diesel oil, sniffed at
the french motor design . and bonn defense chiefs preferred a
fast-firing british 105-mm . cannon that did not fit the chassis the
french were talking about . last week bonn's new defense minister
kai-uwe von hassel officially scrapped the europa panzer idea, declared
that west germany would produce a flashy new tank of its own . french
defense officials had gotten word of the decision long before their
charles de gaulle had signed his new pact with bonn . but the canceled
deal was bound to set minds on both sides of the rhine wondering just
how useful their treaty really was .

great britain guilty innocent one night in 1943, london police on
robbery detail stopped a seedy little man for routine questioning and
seemed to have stumbled on the solution of a murder in portsmouth, 65
miles away . harold loughan a brash habitual criminal volunteered the
information that he had crept into the rooms above the john barleycorn
pub three weeks before and, in committing a robbery, had strangled to
death the pub's owner, rose robinson . " it's a relief to get it off my
mind, "  he told the police .  " i didn't mean to kill the old girl,
but you know what it is when a woman screams . " confession v . alibi .
when the details of the confession checked out in portsmouth, loughan
was charged with murder . " i felt confident that i could not lose the
case even if i conducted it standing on my head, " recalls joshua david
casswell, who was the prosecutor in the court proceedings that followed
. but to casswell's chagrin, loughan dismissed his confession as the
kind of casual lie he enjoyed telling the police, claimed he spent the
night of the murder sheltered from the blitz in london's warren street
subway station and produced five independent witnesses to prove it . "
this is the most extraordinary case i've ever known, " said the judge .
/ on the one hand a full confession, and on the other an unshakable
alibi . " the jury, equally puzzled, could not reach a verdict . in a
retrial, loughan was acquitted . he was still gloating when arrested on
the steps of old bailey for another robbery and, after his 24th
conviction, sent to prison for seven years . that might have been the
last anybody heard of little harold loughan if the people, a
sensational london sunday newspaper, had not printed the memoirs of
prosecutor casswell . in one installment, casswell claimed that harold
loughan would have been convicted if all the evidence had been heard .
loughan, now 66 and in jail as usual, sued for libel, claiming he had
been called a murderer despite his official innocence . murder or libel
. the newspaper's lawyer argued that even if the articles did amount to
calling loughan a murderer, truth is a defense against libel, and
casswell had finally shown that loughan had indeed murdered rose
robinson 19 years ago . for eleven days the jury heard evidence of the
old murder with loughan still protesting his innocence . " you are
asked to try again a murder in the guise of a libel action, " his
lawyer complained to the jury . last week the jury returned its verdict
: the people was not guilty of libel because loughan was guilty of the
murder . loughan, of course, cannot be tried again for the same crime .
if the jury was correct, he had cheated the gallows . but that was
little comfort to harold loughan . after the trial he was returned to
the prison hospital where, after spending 23 of his 66 years behind
bars, he awaits death from inoperable cancer .

middle east who's
wooing who ? in cairo, president gamal abdel nasser acted like an
ex-champion seeking a successful comeback . he lost much of his claim
for the title of arab leadership in 1961, when an army coup wrenched
syria from its short-lived merger with egypt in the united arab
republic . that left nasser without a single arab ally, and surrounded
by such virulent enemies as iraq's dictator kassem and the kings of
jordan and saudi arabia . then came last month's iraqi revolution and
the overthrow of kassem . no one could blame egypt's leader for harking
back to old dreams of arab grandeur, for this new man in baghdad
president abdul salam aref was a former nasser protege dedicated to
panarab unity . tribute to mother . with this in mind, nasser mounted a
platform in cairo's vast republic square last week to celebrate the
fifth anniversary of his defunct united arab republic . strings of
ramadan lights outlined the mosques and minarets, and a crowd of 20,000
jammed the square protected from the cold night air by a siwan, a "
hall " roofed and walled by brightly colored canvas . " union ! union
! union ! nasser ! nasser ! nasser ! " roared the mob . what
it got was a little less than nasser had hoped for . the leaders of the
iraqi delegation to the celebration, deputy premier ali saleh saadi and
foreign minister talib hussein shabib, were cordial enough, but they
were far from specific . saadi dutifully paid tribute to egypt as the "
mother republic " of the arab world, but instead of calling for union,
he urged only a /frank rapprochement " between cairo and baghdad . was
this enough sure, cried nasser in his own speech . today, he declared
/ there is a unity of objectives between the revolution in baghdad and
the revolution in cairo, " and " we do not need treaties or
constitutional forms to prove this unity . " jail for the dog . in
baghdad, new president aref and his colleagues were too busy learning
how to run a country to pay much attention . the slain kassem, now
dubbed " the mad tyrant, " had quarreled with all his neighbors . aref
was restoring trade relations with egypt, imports from lebanon and
exports to little kuwait, the oil-rich principality kassem once tried
to take over . tidying up another national problem, aref sent a
helicopter north to pick up two delegates of the kurdish rebels in the
hope that he might negotiate an end to the bloody civil war that has
tied up half the 75,000-man iraqi army ; he even made friendly
overtures to the u.s.-british controlled iraq petroleum co., which
kassem had alienated . as for the communists of baghdad, they were
still going into jails . the result was one of the biggest single red
propaganda barrages since the reds charged the u.s . with using germ
warfare in korea . pravda's correspondent claimed, " i saw tanks crush
women and children, " and reported the " physical annihilation of
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of iraqi democrats and patriots . " the
pravda man went looking for aziz sharif, a 1962 lenin peace prizewinner
at the office of the peace partisans league (a euphemism for red
militia) . a soldier on guard at the office told him, " that dog has
long since been jailed . " the soviet red cross even appealed to the
international red cross to help protect communists, whom it preferred
to call " the democratic patriots victimized by bloody persecution in
iraq . " when the first hectic days were over, the novices would get
around to answering gamal abdel nasser's cry for union . at week's end
iraq's thinking was summed up by foreign minister shahib, who proposed
a joint meeting of the four " liberated " arab states (iraq, egypt,
yemen, algeria) to " coordinate work among them in various fields with

neutralist prince souvanna phouma's left-right-center coalition
government has displayed a remarkable record of consistency : it has
failed to carry out one single provision of the geneva accords . rent
by internal dissension, the government has been unable to maintain a
cease-fire, evict all foreign military personnel from laos, integrate
the three military and political factions, or hold free elections . but
the supposedly " neutralist " government has recognized every country
in the communist bloc, and has done so little to halt the rampant
inflation that the price of the kip has risen from 80 to 180 per dollar
. on the plaine des jarres, headquarters of both the neutralist and
communist pathet lao armies, the reds have begun a campaign to
infiltrate and subvert the forces of their onetime neutralist allies .
farther north, thousands of red chinese workers have crossed into laos
to build roads linking china's yunnan province with communist-held
areas of laos itself . armed with new red chinese automatic weapons,
the pathet lao is attacking neutralist villages on the supply lines
between the plaine des jarres and communist north viet nam to the east

to westerners' fears that laos is
going to the communists by default .

odious crime, " said kong le, " was the work of those who are under a
foreign influence . " kong le restricted his troops to their base,
ordered the pathet lao to keep out of neutralist encampments . top
neutralist officers wondered where the reds would strike next . one

nigeria nation on trial in 1960, when nigeria won its
independence, it became at birth the world's most populous black state
and africa's biggest question mark . held together in uneasy
federation, the country numbered some 250 tribes and languages, three
principal religions (moslem, christian, animist), and three big,
traditionally hostile regions : the feudal, moslem north, which claims
half the entire population of nigeria ; the east, dominated by the
astute, industrious ibo tribes ; and the west, richest and most
advanced of all three, whose yoruba tribesmen are nigeria's most
sophisticated citizens . as big as texas and oklahoma combined, with
some 45 million inhabitants give or take 10 million nigeria seemed less
a nation than a concatenation, a haphazard creation of british
colonists who ruled it for 60 years and dubbed it the " white man's
grave . " nigeria has survived to become africa's most conspicuously
successful democracy . its birth pangs were eased by a long tradition
of tribal government, and by the solid good sense of many african
leaders whom the british groomed for self-rule notably its federal
prime minister, sir abubakar tafawa balewa (time cover, dec . 5, 1960)
. the greatest single assurance of stability has been nigeria's tripod
form of government, designed to prevent any one region from dominating
the other two . that system is now in jeopardy, and with it the very
future of nigeria as a democracy and as a nation . political play ?
nigeria's complex crisis is being played out in the scrupulously
decorous high court in the federal capital of lagos . there, in the
course of a trial that has dragged on for four months, the leader of
the opposition, obafemi awolowo, last week opened his own defense
against a government indictment charging him and 24 other leading
politicians with conspiracy to overthrow the government . nearly all
the defendants are members of awolowo's action group, the party that
rules western nigeria and represents it in the federal parliament .
chief awolowo is not alone in branding the trial a political play to
wreck his party and eliminate the opposition . the crisis was actually
precipitated by awolowo, 54, a mercurial, london-trained barrister who
became opposition leader in lagos when his party lost the 1959 federal
elections . awolowo then ranged his people firmly against the
middle-road coalition government, composed of the conservative northern
people's congress (npc), supported by the proud, primitive fulani and
hausa tribes of the north, and the progressive national convention of
nigerian citizens (ncnc), which is based in the east . smashed mace .
chief samuel l . akintola, who became deputy leader of the action group
and western region premier, last may rebelled against awolowo's
policies, was sacked as deputy leader and dismissed as the west's
premier (he was later reinstated by court order) . awolowo's
high-handed reprisals led to a chairthrowing melee in the western
region assembly at ibadan in which the ceremonial mace was shattered
and the politicians subdued with tear gas . seizing their chance to
quash the opposition, rival party bosses in lagos persuaded the
reluctant sir abubakar to dispatch federal forces to the west and
declare a state of emergency that was lifted only at year's end . the
government also initiated an exhaustive investigation of regional and
party finances, charged awolowo and other party chieftains with
diverting $18 million in public funds . on top of the corruption
scandals, the government last november filed its sensational indictment
accusing awolowo of sending agents to ghana for para-military training
as terrorists in a plot to seize power in lagos . universal dash .
chief awolowo last week scornfully termed " absolutely unreliable and
incredible " the prosecution's charges that he had conspired to " levy
war " against the government . " today, " he said defiantly, " i may be
languishing in prison . i am not going to die there . i still believe i
will be prime minister some day . /
as for the corruption charges, awolowo's
supporters argue that malfeasance is no less rife in the other regions
. they are probably quite right . " dash, " as nigerians cheerfully
call their ritualistic system of payoffs, is so universal that many
traffic cops have a fixed bribe for every violation (running a red
light costs 28 #$ ), and hospital nurses sometimes demand a penny for
bringing a patient a bedpan . members of parliament, whose cadillacs
and mercedeses help make lagos traffic jams among the worst in africa,
earn more ($17,000 including expenses) than british m.p.s, but many
manage to eke out the cost of living on ikoyi island with a little help
from foreign industrialists and local entrepreneurs . " nigerian
businessmen, " says a european banker in lagos, " are the biggest bunch
of con men i've ever seen . " for all their surface cynicism, nigerians
by contrast with most thin-skinned citizens of africa's new nations are
searchingly self-critical and take fierce pride in their exuberantly
uninhibited press . younger politicians in all the parties are
increasingly disillusioned by the flagrant venality of their elders and
the chasm that divides lagos' doyens of dash from the jobless hordes
who have swarmed into its festering slums and almost trebled the city's
population (to 750,000) in three decades . the best guarantee . many
young nigerians deride the government's faith in private enterprise,
and in international affairs they are openly impatient with the
incorruptible sir abubakar's pragmatic, unpretentious and rather
old-fashioned style . as africa's most populous nation, they argue,
nigeria is the continent's logical leader . " when you're in accra, "
complains a lagos newsman, " you cannot help feeling that you're at the
center of pan-african activity . why don't we get refugees from other
parts of africa ? " if the action group is destroyed by the treason
trial, many nigerians believe, a new, radical party will have to take
its place or else the nation's restive leftwingers may well resort to
real violence . meanwhile, though premier akintola has already formed a
new,moderate movement in the west called the united people's party, the
vacuum left by the action group may be filled by the ncnc, whose
longtime boss, dr . nnamdi ( " zik " ) azikiwe, is more or less removed
from active politics in his post as nigeria's governor-general . but
ambitious, flamboyant zik makes no secret of his aim to make nigeria a
republic, in which ncnc could emerge as the dominant national party and
zik himself might well be a strong president.many nigerians, shocked by
the government's seven-month suspension of civil rights, now fear that
a single, powerful party may be tempted to impose the kind of
authoritarian rule that has been riveted on ghana and guinea . the
government's most immediate concern is that the country's current
scandals will mar its reputation for stability and scare away the
foreign investors on whom it is counting for at least 50 per cent of
the financing for the $1.9 billion, six-year development plan it
launched last year . to sir abubakar, the social and economic progress
this will ensure is the best guarantee of meaningful nationhood for
nigeria .

the allies the nato deterrent almost as old as nato
itself is the " disarray " that seems to haunt its councils . yet
allied differences are not so much symptoms of any deep-rooted disunity
as the result of nato's military effectiveness . because they know that
they are secure behind the u.s . nuclear shield, few european nations
are eager to build up conventional forces for which they see little use
. at the same time, as they have grown more powerful and prosperous,
europeans have come to question total u.s . control of nuclear weapons
for the foreseeable future . thus dependence breeds mistrust . charles
de gaulle is not the only european to fear that the u.s . cannot be
counted upon to risk destruction of its cities if russia were to attack
western europe despite repeated u.s . assurances of its long-term
strategic commitment to europe, and heedless of the fact that 400,000
g.i.s on the continent are a permanent u.s . hostage to europe's
security . yet neither france's embryonic force de frappe nor britain's
near-obsolete v-bomber strike force carries sufficient punch to deter,
let alone defeat, an aggressor . fine watches . last week, in an
attempt to soothe europe's restiveness by giving its allies greater
responsibility for their own security, the u.s . made its most serious
pitch yet to share the planning and control of atomic weapons in europe
with europeans themselves . before nato's 15member permanent council in
paris, president kennedy's special envoy, livingston merchant, proposed
creation of a multinational nuclear deterrent consisting of a fleet of
surface ships equipped with the u.s . polaris missile . key provision
of the plan is that the ships would be " multimanned, " i.e., their
crews would be drawn from every nato nation that would be willing to
help foot the bill . cost of the international task force would be
about $2 billion for 200 missiles and their floating launch pads ; it
would take at least three years to build, about half as much in time
and money as it would take to create a multinational nuclear polaris
submarine fleet . originally, in fact, the u.s . had hastily suggested
that multi-manned, multinational polaris submarines might be a logical
progression from the independent polaris subs that britain has agreed
to build (but has committed to nato) . apart from the cost, however,
congress has already indicated that it is dead set against giving u.s .
allies the components or know-how to build the submarines . moreover,
old naval hands are aghast at the prospect of manning submarines with
crews of mixed nationalities . warned a west german naval expert last
week : " sub crews are the fine watches of naval warfare . there can
be no room for misunderstanding . /
force or farce ? as for whose finger will be
on the trigger of the new surface fleet, the u.s . agrees that each
participating ally will have an equal veto . for all the argument it
provokes, however, the question of control is largely academic ; the
fingers would be unanimous . " do you really believe that europe will
want to shoot this thing off without being sure that the major u.s .
force would be used ? " asked a u.s . strategist . " considering it
as a second strike force, the semantics of voting becomes irrelevant .
/ seven nato partners britain, belgium, italy, greece, the netherlands,
turkey, west germany were immediately receptive to merchant's proposal
. west germany expressed the warmest interest ; the british looked on
the scheme with " mild benevolence . " but all seven wanted to hear
more about it, and allowed that the price was high and the payoff
distant . meanwhile, all but a fraction of the existing western atomic
stockpile would remain under u.s . lock and key . the proposal was
coldly received in france, where the gaullist daily la nation even
dubbed the prospect of a multilateral force " la farce multilaterale .
/ if the polaris plan had been touted as a significant boost to the
west's deterrent, the gibe might have been justified . as it was, the
joke fell flat because a jointly manned, jointly financed armada may
actually offer solid benefits for both the u.s . and europe . arts
course . for the first time, a multinational deterrent would allow
europeans to collaborate with the u.s . from scratch in targeting,
contingency planning and control of atomic weapons ; it would satisfy
their acute desire for atomic knowhow by giving them a thorough
education in complex technological and financial nuclear realities .
for both sides, it would provide an added, substantial token of
u.s . determination to remain in europe and defend its allies with the
ultimate
weapon, if necessary . says a u.s . defense planner : " this is one
thing that can put glue in the alliance . " as merchant prepared to
leave paris this week for a series of briefings on the plan in rome,
brussels, bonn and london, another u.s . diplomat pointed out an even
greater incentive to participate : " those nations that contribute to
this force will know more about the missile arts in a year than the
french do . /

france the personal touch as other europeans railed against
charles de gaulle's vision of a french-led europe, many frenchmen last
week were uneasily contemplating de gaulle's influence on their own
society . since the november election turned the national assembly into
a virtual annexe of the elysee palace, de gaulle has ruled with little
parliamentary criticism and with only muted rumblings from france's
once rambunctious press . it has become clear that le grand charles has
established a personal regime in which, though it is not remotely so
autocratic a government as that of francisco franco, almost any
potential controversy is similarly quelled by the government lest it be
interpreted abroad as a direct expression of national policies . with
virtually unlimited powers under france's emergency laws, de gaulle's
government in recent months has : canceled the showing of a tv
documentary to mark the 20th anniversary of the battle of stalingrad .
prepared by the state-owned tv network, the film included a tirade by
nikita khrushchev that, in the government's words, was " violently
hostile to west germany and to the policy of franco-german
rapprochement . " same week, another documentary movie, death in
madrid, consisting mostly of stock shots taken during the 1936 spanish
civil war, was denied a license for exhibition in france or abroad
presumably for fear of offending franco . ordered the paris opera to
cancel a performance by rudolf nureyev, a russian ballet dancer who
defected to the west in 1961 . though nureyev has already danced in
paris, london and new york, the french government plainly felt that his
appearance in paris would be an affront to nikita khrushchev .
confiscated nearly 75,000 copies of a novel, high court, in which
right-wing author alfred fabre-luce gives a fictional account of a
future trial of de gaulle as it might be conducted if he were impeached
by the senate . the government's object this time was to avoid offense
to charles de gaulle himself . some of the government's repressions are
explicable as international backscratching . de gaulle's increasing
amiability toward spain has been rewarded by franco's jailing of six
top anti-gaullist terrorists who were hiding out in spain . banning the
stalingrad show may just possibly have been repaid last week when
german police failed to prevent mysterious french agents in munich from
kidnaping a top s.a.o . leader, antoine argoud (see below) . but it
seemed unlikely that khrushchev would care greatly if nureyev danced in
paris, or that adenauer would object to being damned by nikita on tv .
on the other hand, when a government is not subject to censure or legal
redress, who expects logic ?

afternoon last week while a thickset, somberly dressed stranger used
the public telephone at la esmeralda cafe, across the square from
paris' notre-dame cathedral . " this is the s.a.o., " he barked . "

out, the square de l'archeveche started filling with french police .
just as the man said, a small delivery truck was parked in the alley,
and inside it the gendarmes found a gagged, trussed, middleaged man .
lifting the blindfold, a cop peered at the battered, bloody face and
nodded : " it looks like argoud . " fasching frawl . ever since april
1961, ex-colonel antoine-charles-louis-marie argoud, 48, had been one
of the terrorist secret army organization's top leaders . earlier, as a
sector commander in algeria, he was famed for his use of psychological
warfare tactics against the rebel f.l.n . an argoud specialty :
exhibiting in the streets bodies of executed moslem prisoners as a
warning . after leaving algeria, he grew a beard and shuttled
anonymously between italy, germany and switzerland . argoud had already
been sentenced to death in absentia for his part in the 1961 generals'
putsch, and, as a member of the diehard council of national resistance,
is believed to have ordered the attempted assassination of de gaulle at
petit-clamart, outside paris, last year . soon after the paris press
headlined the story of the arrest, l'affaire argoud was turned into a
first-rate international whodunit by the owner of munich's hotel eden
wolff, who said that the s.a.o . leader had checked in there the
previous night . three hours after he had registered, said the
hotelman, two men entered the lobby and sent a note up to his room .
argoud came down and spoke to his visitors, who showed him something .
all three started out the door together, but then argoud tried to pull
away . the other two grabbed him, hauled him out to the street, knocked
him down, threw him into an auto and drove away . at the height of
munich's riotous pre-lenten celebrations, any policeman might have
shrugged it off as just another fasching brawl .
legendary beards . as they read the headlines, parisians began to
question the official version that argoud had been betrayed by the
s.a.o . how had he been smuggled from germany into france ? was the
phone call really from an s.a.o . man ? could pierre chateau-jobert,
though supposed to be argoud's rival for leadership of the foundering
s.a.o., really have betrayed a comrade in this way ? the newspapers
plunged gleefully into the guessing game : argoud, they said, had been
captured by les barbouzes (the bearded ones), the legendary triggermen
of the french secret services . it was speculated that the esmeralda
phone call was simply the government's way of establishing an alibi
after its agents had illegally kidnaped argoud in germany .
argoud's attorney pointedly cited two
similar " illegal " kidnapings : that of adolf eichmann by the
israelis and, even more to the point, that of the emigre duke
d'enghien, who, suspected of plotting against napoleon, was snatched in
germany by french police and then tried and executed . whatever the
truth of the matter, parisians agreed that l'affaire argoud was truly
rocambolesque, incredible . to cap it, police last week rounded up nine
other s.a.o . men in a paris apartment, charged them with having
planned (though they failed even to attempt) the assassination of
premier georges pompidou last year . argoud's arrest had another result
: it caused a one-day adjournment in the trial of nine defendants
(time, feb . 22) accused of being part of the gang that tried to kill
de gaulle at petit-clamart . meanwhile, the government will seek to
establish that argoud was a member of the council of national
resistance, which ordered the ambush at petit-clamart, and the rest of
france will keep guessing who accomplished argoud's capture .

india date with desai to india's able finance minister morarji
desai, austerity is a way of life . not only is he a vegetarian and a
teetotaler who fasts for a day and a half every week, but he is also a
hardheaded fiscal conservative who derides pie-in-the-sky welfare
schemes and is an ardent believer in pay-as-you-go financing . last
week desai presented the indian parliament with an austerity budget
that will put the entire nation on the desai standard . to finance
india's herculean task of equipping its armed forces against the
continuing threat of chinese aggression, desai boosted the budget by a
staggering 33 per cent to a record $3.8 billion ; defense expenditures
alone jumped 70 per cent, to $1.8 billion . but desai refused to
squeeze the money out of the government's costly five-year plan or even
to rely on large-scale deficit financing . the cost will be borne by
india's population whose per capita income last year was $69 . personal
income taxes in the lower brackets will be increased as much as 450 per
cent . import duties on most raw materials, machinery and manufactured
goods will be boosted from 15 per cent to 55 per cent . all of india's
taxpayers will have to deposit up to 3 per cent of their after-tax
incomes in government savings accounts ; businesses whose after-tax
incomes exceed 6 per cent of their capital value must pay a 50 per cent
tax on all subsequent profits . all basic household goods, cloth, food
and cooking fuels will be hit with new taxes . only exceptions :
sugar, shoes, rice and matches . adverse reaction to the budget was
surprisingly mild . some businessmen protested that desai could have
eased the tax burden by slashing unnecessary government expenditures ;
others pointed out that india might have been spared the crushing new
taxes if the government had spent enough money in the past to have made
a more creditable showing against the chinese . grumbled one : " this
is a high price to pay for ladakh even assuming we do get it back . "
but most indians closed ranks behind desai . said one government
official : " the budget is the clearest answer yet given by an asian
democracy to communist expansion . /

denmark cutting back with krag
no ascetic is denmark's
premier jens otto krag, 48 . a dashing dane with a nose for opportunity
and an eye for pretty women, he has been married twice : first to
swedish actress birgit tengroth, currently to danish movie star helle
virkner, who has been named as one of europe's ten most attractive
women . in copenhagen last week, after only six months in office, krag
faced his supreme political test when he introduced into parliament a
complex series of measures that will 1) extend all union contracts for
two years, thus limiting wage increases ; 2) fix maximum prices of all
consumer goods except fish and farm products ; and 3) compel all
taxpayers to buy up to $290 in 4 per cent bonds that cannot be redeemed
for five years . a trained economist, krag insisted that his draconian
measures are essential ; more than any other nation in europe, denmark
had staked its economic future on joining the common market along with
britain . when de gaulle blackballed britain's membership, france's
president shrewdly promised denmark immediate admission . krag's reply
was sharp and to the point : " we have no wish to be one of president
de gaulle's pieces in the political chess game with britain . it is
important that we keep our two major customers, britain and west
germany, inside the same organization . it must be our purpose in all
fields to see that negotiations for a unified europe go on . " but
krag's loyalty to his friends abroad hardly allayed his headaches at
home . racked by severe inflation, denmark last year saw its trade
deficit dangerously increased to $486 million, while its currency
reserves were cut in half . in the last four years, danish wages have
risen 40 per cent , production less than 20 per cent . the stringent
new economic program drew anguished cries from employers and the
political opposition, but krag curtly rejected the traditional danish
compromise . krag's coalition government can undoubtedly squeeze the
bill through parliament by its usual one-vote majority, and the danes
will have to tighten their belts for years of austerity ahead .

south korea over to you, gentlemen to all outward appearances,
south korea's ruling military junta has wielded iron-fisted control
over the country since it seized power in a lightning coup nearly two
years ago . under strongman general park chung hee, the government
stifled all opposition ; newspapers were gagged, and 4,000 known
political opponents of the regime were forbidden to criticize it in
public . but park has been less successful in quelling disaffection
within his own junta . last week the wrangling was out in the open,
threatening to plunge south korea into yet another full-scale
crisis . snooper boss . park's generals became openly restive soon
after his decision to restore civilian political rule (time, dec . 28),
at least in name . in fact, junta members planned merely to swap their
khaki for mufti and continue to run the country ; park himself was the
leading candidate for the presidency . this pleasant prospect was
shattered last january when brigadier general kim chong pil, husband of
park's niece and boss of the dreaded central intelligence agency, quit
the c.i.a .  in order to grab control of the regime's civilian
political organization, the democratic-republican party with park's
tacit approval kim whose 30,000 snoopers had kept  tabs on anything
and anyone the junta might distrust including members of the junta
infiltrated the party's power positions with 1,200 of his former c.i.a
agents., junta members objected to kim's power grab as a blatant
attempt to cut them out of the lion's share of the spoils . when they
insisted that park fire kim from the party leadership, park retaliated
by sacking four of kim's bitterest foes from the junta . but the four,
all high-ranking officers, threatened to plunge south korea into civil
war unless park brought kim to heel . " the entire army is against you,
one officer told park . " you cannot win . " failed objective . park
finally capitulated . he forced kim to resign his party post, last week
sent him on a 50-day foreign inspection trip as his " ambassador
plenipotentiary . " no sooner had kim left than investigators began
exploring rumors that he had used his powerful c.i.a . job to make a
stock market killing and to mulct kickbacks from government contractors
. before 3,000 screaming politicians in seoul's citizens hall, park
announced grimly that he was bowing out of the presidential race . " i
cannot help admitting, " he said, " that the revolutionary government
has failed completely in achieving its political objective the
emergence of new political personalities . " certainly, park's
withdrawal and kim's fall from grace failed to turn up any promising
new political leaders the junta-controlled democratic-republican party
is in floundering disarray while the three other major civilian parties
which are also riven by internal dissension, lack any broad base of
popular support . thus, few south koreans expect that park will remain
long in the wings . with inflation rampant and unemployment at a record
high, many politicians suspect that park is deliberately saddling them
with chaos, that in his own good time, he may once again " save " the
country .

russia back to siberia, comrades soviet scientists have not yet
taught shrimps to whistle, but radio moscow last week reported an even
more fantastic feat . geologists in northern siberia, it recounted
breathlessly, dug up a pair of salamanders that had been frozen for
5,000 years, thawed them out and fed them berries and mosquitoes from
their hands . one of the prehistoric newts (tritons) scampered happily
about for three weeks before it died ; it was then bottled and sent to
a moscow university laboratory . its comrade lived for several months
in a museum . radio moscow, which said the tale of two tritons was
based on an account in a soviet literary magazine, even suggested that
the discovery might have momentous implications for space flight . if
newts could survive all that time, why not deepfreeze soviet cosmonauts
and thus eliminate the need for food during their long voyages through
the universe ? radio moscow's story blew up a storm of cables and
telephone calls from western newsmen panting after all the newty
details . and, though u.s . scientists soon pooh-poohed the salamander
saga, it made the front pages of most u.s . newspapers, which since
sputnik i have tended to overplay far-out soviet scientific claims .
then a russian scientist debunked the story . professor gleb
lozino-lozinsky, head of the space biology laboratory at the leningrad
institute of cytology, disclosed that it had been lifted from a
children's book, and " has nothing to do with science . " snapped he :

japan when they start playing footsie, it's time for a girl
to quit along the ginza, tokyo's garish main stem, a bar girl has to be
able to handle all types but even so, there's a limit . it came for one
ginza doll last week when, as she put it, " i felt something playing
footsie with me under the table . " said she : " i figured it was the
customer ; but the game went on after he excused himself . then i
looked down, and there was this huge rat trying to pry some meat out
from under my foot . sure, i knew we had rats, but when they get that
familiar, i quit . " melons & minks . they have been getting more
importunate every day . some 2,000,000 strong, twice as numerous as the
district's daytime human population, the ginza rat kingdom seems to
have been caught up in a revolution of rodent expectations . no longer
content with their network of underground rivers and sewers, armies of
rats now prowl the ginza every night after the cabarets have closed and
before department stores open . rats with affluent tastes gorge
themselves on such fancy groceries as melons, leather furniture and
mink coats . one gormandizing rat pack even held up construction of a
new building by chewing through a strong box and gobbling the
blueprints ; dim ginza bars have regular, unscheduled blackouts
whenever rats gnaw through power lines, a never-failing taste treat .
when a u.s . tourist was assured by the manager of a luxurious ginza
hotel that he couldn't possibly have seen a rat " as big as a cat " in
his room, the american bought a rat trap, showed up at the reservation
desk the next day triumphantly lugging a f-lb . rattus norvegicus .
last week tokyo's sanitation department joined forces with a passel of
private exterminators in an all-out campaign to keep the ginza for
people . with military precision, anti-rat guerrillas fanned out
through darkened department stores in stockinged feet, coordinating
their offensive by means of walkie-talkies . " this is c team calling b
team, " whispered one communications man to the unit on the floor below
him . " i hear rats on the eastern side of the floor scurrying down .
close door immediately . over . " meatballs & mikes . for weapons, the
rat hunters mostly used a supply of 300,000 poisoned meatballs about
one for every six or eight rats believed to be in the ginza .
exterminators bugged ratholes with tiny microphones so as to detect
enemy strongholds . they also planted extrastrong traps that are
normally used to trap mink since ginza rats are a special samurai breed
that can usually chew through a conventional trap . the hunters had no
illusions about their foe . " the ginza rats are terribly clever, "
said one old rodent fighter . " you can't just leave a meatball by a
rathole and expect them to eat its much too obvious . what you must do
is put the meatballs in, say, a cardboard box with a little hole in it
. then the rat will eat it thinking it's something you don't want him
to have . " in three days, the exterminators had killed about 6,500
rats outright, and expected another 3,000 to die later as the poison
took effect . but each female rat can theoretically produce about 70

when a middle-aged widower or a plain, bespectacled spinster can break
out of the everyday litany of loneliness and who knows ? find true
love across a crowded beer hall . of those who were still lonely as
fasching ended last week, many would not wait for next year's
festivities ; they will turn instead to one of west germany's 200
marriage agencies, such as the booming " institute for elegant
individual marriage initiation . " chirped bonn marriage broker alice
paech on ash wednesday : " now it will start all over again . "
wagnerian supermen . for a " searching fee " that averages about $50,
buxom frau paech and other professional cupid chasers will methodically
remake the whimsical old game according to cold teutonic logic .
clients are interviewed for the necessary information background,
interests, social status, financial situation and brought together
through carefully matched briefing sheets . for about one in every
three couples she introduces, frau paech manages to find the right
combination, and collects a " success fee " equal to the searching fee
unless the happy couple forget to notify her that they are getting
married . west german papers are filled with such agency-placed ads as
/ a heart to give away am 39, 160 (centimeters tall), alone, not ugly,
but wearer of glasses, " or " hello, hello ! what young man between
35 and 45 would like to try his happiness with me ? " agencies make a
paunchy male sound like a wagnerian superman, a wilting wallflower a
paragon of charm and virtue . many agencies put love on a chain-store
basis, increasing the chance for a successful match by trading clients
among as many as 32 branches . drawing clients from every class and
profession, marriage brokers account for 60,000 to 80,000 marriages
every year . security first . today's thriving trade is the outgrowth
of a business that has had its greatest boom during the manshort years
following world war ii . the main reason for its growth, says an

social life in west germany today we have become a little selfish and
don't concern ourselves much with our fellow men . " known by the

yemen for allah & the imam from remote yemen last
september came word of a revolution that had toppled the centuries-old
dynasty of imam mohammed el badr . leader of the coup was colonel
abdullah sallal, 45, newly appointed commander of the palace guard, who
announced in the yemen capital of san " a that his troops had killed
the imam and were in control of the primitive, nebraska-sized country .
weeks later it was learned that badr had in fact escaped the shelled
ruins of his palace and taken refuge in yemen's rugged hill country,
whose warlike tribes have traditionally been loyal to the imam .
clouded claims . ever since, helped by money and supplies from the
uneasy monarchs of saudi arabia and jordan, the imam and his tribal
warriors have been inching doggedly back toward san " a . president
sallal appealed for help to egypt's gamal abdel nasser, an old friend
of the imam but an even more implacable foe of the oil-rich desert
dynasties who were helping badr . nasser rushed in egyptian troops,
whose soviet-made guns, tanks and jets make them the arab world's most
formidable fighting force . though the republicans had not in fact won
the whole country, the u.s . decided reluctantly last december to
recognize sallal's regime, having first won nasser's promise to
withdraw his troops . egypt's president has not only failed to honor
his pledge but has actually raised the expeditionary force to 23,000
troops on the pretext that britain, saudi arabia and jordan have all
sent in forces to help the imam . britain, which has not recognized
sallal, fears that egyptian penetration of the arabian peninsula will
isolate its oilfields and deal a crippling blow to its economy .
fearful lest the hot little war engulf the entire middle east, the u.n
. last week sent ralph bunche, a veteran middle east troubleshooter who
is trusted by both sides, to discuss a solution with representatives of
sallal and the imam ; from yemen he will go to egypt, saudi arabia and
jordan . the actual course of the fighting has been clouded by the
grandiose claims of both sides and the formidable obstacles that face
western newsmen who even try to get into yemen, let alone reach the
battle lines . one who succeeded was time correspondent george de
carvalho . from beirut last week he cabled his report on a 23-day trek
in which he crossed the peaks, plateaus and wadis from aden to the
saudi arabian border, traveling a total of 1,000 miles by camel,
donkey, car and shoe leather without once leaving royalistheld
territory (see map) . along the way, correspondent de carvalho was
repeatedly shot at by egyptian fighter planes, tanks, mortars, and
artillery, saw two of his six yemeni guards killed and one wounded in
battle . rifles & faith . the fighting is most intense in a 70-mile arc
curving around the eastern approaches to san " a . in most areas, the
royalists limit themselves to hit-and-run guerrilla raids, but here
they are taking and holding ground, attacking steadily and advancing on
a wide front . reports de carvalho : " the incredible fact is that the
egyptians are losing in yemen . ragged, barefoot yemeni tribesmen,
armed only with ancient rifles and faith in allah, are kicking hell out
of nasser's elite troops despite their overpowering soviet equipment,
overwhelmingly superior firepower, and unchallenged airpower . "
the war in yemen is being fought between
the 10th century and the 20th . the mountain tribes have no officers'
corps or noncoms ; they simply choose their sheiks and follow them
into battle . " we captured 14 field radios, " sighed prince abdullah
ibn hassan, 25, a cousin of the imam . " but none of my men know how to
use them . " nor can they use captured tanks or trucks, since none of
the tribesmen know how to drive . when they attack a tank, the
tribesmen first kill off the accompanying infantrymen, then often set
it afire with flaming corn stalks . the egyptians are restricted to the
few rough roads and depend on daily delivery of supplies, while the
royalists can fight anywhere . says prince abdullah : " all my men
need is bread and bullets . we will fight until we are all dead or the
egyptians are driven into the sea . we bow only to god . " plastered
skirmishers . yemen's roads and fields are littered with the remains of
dead egyptians left to rot unburied . " let the dogs eat the egyptian
dogs, " spat a tribesman . the few egyptians taken prisoner seem dazed
and dejected . private amer hussein bahid, 24, of cairo, was due for
for discharge
in january after three years' army service . instead, his company was
airlifted to san'a and rushed off to launch a counterattack at beit
miran . said he : " about 25 miles from san'a we were ambushed . my
company never got a chance to fight . in a few hours, more than 100 of
us were killed, and i surrendered . " nasser has apparently had to call
up the reserves . complained sergeant ibrahim mohsin alkati, 32, who
was a cairo truck mechanic before he was recalled to duty : " i didn't
even know there was a war on in yemen . i thought we were supposed to
help train the yemeni republican army . " one battle witnessed by
correspondent de carvalho was at el argoup, 25 miles southeast of
san'a, where 500 yemenis commanded by prince abdullah attacked an
egyptian position on top of a sheersided hill that was fortified with
six soviet t-54 tanks, a dozen armored cars and entrenched machine guns
. the yemenis, advancing in a thin skirmish line, were plastered by
artillery, mortars and strafing planes . they could reply only with
rifles, one mortar with 20 rounds, and a bazooka with four rounds
handled by a man who had never fired a bazooka before in his life . the
fight for el argoup lasted a week and ended in a rout that cost the
egyptians three tanks, seven armored cars and 160 dead . de carvalho
asked a haggard sheik if his men suffered from battle fatigue . the
sheik frowned : " we suffer from many diseases in yemen, but battle
fatigue what is that ? " the tribesmen's loyalty to the imam is not
always easy to understand . many of the present royalist leaders
suffered cruelly during the 14-year reign of badr's father, ahmad the
devil, whose way of pacifying the hill tribes was to take mass hostages
and behead restive sheiks . shrugged one sheik : " the imams have
ruled us for a thousand years . some were good and some bad . we killed
the bad ones sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones . "
another reason for fighting the republicans is that the hill tribes
belong to the moslem shia sect, of which the imam is the religious head
. the yemenis of the coast and the south belong to the rival sunni sect
(as do most egyptians) . though president sallal is himself a mountain
shia, it is his misfortune to be fighting the fierce mountain shias
with lowland sunnis who have never been famed for martial prowess . the
imam mohammed el badr is a husky, hard-looking man of 36 who roves
constantly along the northwest front in a dodge wagon and never sleeps
more than two nights in the same place . in a wadi under the stars one
night, he told de carvalho :. " nasser's biggest single target in
yemen is me . " waving at the skies from which egyptian jets had
pounced on his forces only that day, he sighed : " now i'm getting my
reward for befriending nasser . we were brothers, but when i refused to
become his stooge, he used sallal against me . i will never stop
fighting . i will never go into exile . win or lose, my grave will be
here . " by last week the war seemed deadlocked . however, imam
mohammed is trying to recruit a mercenary air force, and is building up
a small stock of antitank guns, recoilless rifles and mortars . saudi
arabia, which has bankrolled the royalists so far with about $15
million, is itching to plunge into the fight . in the wake of repeated
bombings of saudi towns, saudi arabia's premier prince feisal warned
u.s . diplomats : " i cannot sit much longer with my arms folded while
nasser attacks not only my neighbor yemen but also my own country . "

middle east spreading infection in the
middle east, revolution is reaching epidemic proportions . a revolt in
yemen last september ousted the centuries-old dynasty of the imam and
installed a " republic " that has ever since been propped up by 20,000
egyptian troops sent in by gamal abdel nasser . in two bloody days'
work last month, iraqi army officers deposed and killed psychotic
dictator abdul karim kassem . last week, on a quiet, grey friday
morning, the infection reached syria . broken bonds . everyone knew it
was coming, from syria's strongman, general abdel karim zahreddin, down
to the lowliest private in the army . when zahreddin severed syria's
union with egypt 17 months ago, he had profited from the nation's
revulsion against the police state and harsh economic controls imposed
by nasser . but syrians, passionate believers in arab unity, also felt
guilty about breaking the bonds . wispy president nazem el-koudsi
sighed, " the trouble with syrians is that we are never concerned with
just our own problems but with issues affecting all arabs . " the
regime survived three major and countless minor conspiracies, but once
iraq rebelled against dictator kassem in the name of arab unity, the
syrian regime was doomed . six cabinet ministers resigned discreetly,
and when members of the baath (renaissance) party were asked to replace
them, they refused . desperate president koudsi eagerly offered to
unite syria with the new revolutionary government of iraq but received
no official reply from baghdad . schools were closed to prevent student
demonstrations against the government, and tanks and armored cars
patrolled the streets of damascus . the revolution came as quietly as a
sunrise . general zahreddin suspected colonel mohammed hariri, chief of
the southern front command, of being a top conspirator and ordered him
sent out of the country as military attache to jordan . hariri refused
to go, and the entire southern command backed him up . an armored
column moved out from the badani military camp and entered damascus,
where the tanks patrolling the streets quickly joined the rebels .
scarcely a shot was fired as syria changed its allegiance . tempers
were so cool that president koudsi was allowed to remain at home with
his family . premier khaled el-azm, who lived beside the turkish
embassy, simply slipped next door and was given political asylum .
damascus radio went on the air proclaiming the baathist slogans of "
unity, freedom, socialism ! " a jubilant syrian army officer at a
border post said, " we want unity, not with nasser, but with all arabs
. " as in iraq, the syrian national council of the revolutionary
command insisted on anonymity . the new 20-man cabinet has only two
military men, and the baath party is strongly represented . new premier
salah el-bitar, 45, is a former syrian foreign minister and a baathist
with strong sympathies toward arab unity . a tall, hulking damascene
with dark, brooding eyes and brilliantined hair, he once signed a
manifesto denouncing union with egypt, but later advocated close
federal ties .
two in one . two revolutions within a
single month have thus put the baathists into power in two nations
stretching from the mediterranean to the persian gulf . the baath party
strongly emphasizes unity with all arab states, including egypt, but
rejects dictatorship by anyone, including nasser . its philosophy calls
for ittihad, loose federation, and pledges overall allegiance to uruba,
a pervasive panarabism . when news of the syrian revolt reached the
iraqi capital of baghdad, a military parade was transformed into a
victory celebration, with long lines of citizens and students
snake-dancing through the city . in cairo, nasser's men hailed the new
syrian regime . it seems probable that nasser will profit from his past
mistakes and settle for a coalition of " liberated " arab states
governed by baathists and pro-nasserites but retaining their separate
identities and sovereignties . the revolutionary wave next threatens
the monarchies of jordan and saudi arabia, which have bitterly opposed
nasser's intervention in yemen and have no love for the unity proposals
of the baath party . the beleaguered kingdoms last week seemed to be
girding for a last-ditch stand . king hussein alerted his arab legion,
the most efficient fighting force in the arab world . prince feisal,
premier of saudi arabia, protested that egyptian planes had bombed
saudi towns on the yemen border and angrily declared, " let the world
know that we are not afraid of war . we saudis are indeed the children
of war . if we have to die, then let us die with honor . unless these
attacks, provocations and childish acts end, then this country will
turn the tables and turn the aggressors head over heels . " positive
way . the united nations' special envoy to the middle east, dr . ralph
bunche, last week visited the republican areas of yemen as part of the
u.n . effort to prevent the arkansas-sized nation from becoming an
international battleground . yemen had delayed bunche's visit until an
egyptian armored column could seize the formerly royalist-held town of
marib, and then exhibited it to bunche as evidence of republican
control of the country . after a 60-minute session with yemen's
strongman abdullah sallal, bunche declared, " i was most impressed by
his earnestness, sincerity, strength and seriousness of purpose . "
stopping off in cairo on his way home,
bunche conferred for two hours with nasser, then saw newsmen . he
emphasized that the yemeni people he saw supported sallal's government
/ in a positive way . " the radio voice of the royalist tribesmen
fighting to restore the imam plaintively begged bunche to visit the
areas they controlled " and see the real truth see the roads, ravines
and mountains of yemen littered with egyptian dead . " but, on this
trip at least, ralph bunche was satisfied to draw his conclusions from
one side only . later, the u.n . let it be known that he plans to visit
the imam on a separate journey in the near future . hard look . in
1958, the last time there was a big revolutionary crisis in the middle
east, the u.s . rushed 14,000 marines and troops to lebanon . last week
the u.s . role was far more ambivalent . washington sent a message to
nasser expressing " grave concern " at continued egyptian bombing of
saudi arabia . instead of marines, the u.s . sent veteran diplomat
ellsworth bunker to saudi arabia to reassure the understandably nervous
prince feisal . u.s . policy seems aimed at safeguarding the
territorial integrity of jordan and saudi arabia from aggression beyond
their borders, not in maintaining the monarchs in power against their
own people . in israel, premier david bengurion interrupted a vacation
to confer with his defense chiefs . the revolution in syria is unlikely
to be the final firecracker on the string . baathist and nasserite
elements are known to be at work in jordan, especially among the
palestinian arabs . saudi arabia can no longer trust its small air
force or even the officer corps of its regular army . if it comes to
fighting, the saudi rulers will depend on their " white army, " the
bedouin tribesmen traditionally loyal to the king . but if the road
ahead looks rough for the monarchies, it by no means is smooth for the
/ liberated " states, since victory most often presents only new
occasions for quarrels, in keeping with the arab proverb that says, " i
and my brother against my cousin ; i and my cousin against the
foreigner . /

france to the mines ! for all the excited headlines,
s.a.o . terrorism was hardly charles de gaulle's main concern last week
. far graver was the challenge to his authority posed by france's
economy . it took the form of a spreading labor strike led by 188,000
stubborn miners concentrated in the grim coal districts of northern
france . three rival unions (roman catholic, socialist, communist) were
out of the pits in a joint demand for a 12 per cent pay boost to
compensate for the creeping inflation that has wiped out much of their
purchasing power in the past three years . de gaulle's reply was in the
authoritarian tradition of an angry old soldier . he put his signature
to a special decree that has the effect of drafting the strikers into
the national serviceorders can be signed by the premier ; by issuing
it himself, de gaulle put his own prestige on the line against the
strikers . as strategists, the miners turned out to be worthy opponents
. though tempted to strike earlier because of the swiftly rising cost
of living, the miners held off until france's coal stocks had been used
up by the bitter cold of the past months . when the strike was only a
few days old, factories began to shut down from lack of fuel . support
for the miners came from all sides . roman catholic bishop gerard
huyghe of arras publicly stated that their conditions must be improved
. in paris, 3,000 university students demonstrated for the strikers,
shouting " de gaulle to the mines ! " the wine dealers association
promised to send 2,600 gallons of red wine to the beer-drinking miners
. other unions pulled short sympathy strikes : railroad workers quit
for 15 minutes ; gas and electric workers walked out for two hours,
stalling subways, stopping work in factories, trapping some unwary
citizens in elevators between floors . de gaulle's requisition order
iself was responsible for much of the sympathy for the miners . under
last week's decree, failure to return to work can be punished by
dismissal, fines and, under certain conditions, jail terms . a coal
cutter in lens said : " we were striking for money and shorter hours,
but now we're striking for the right to strike . " at week's end
premier georges pompidou took his case to the people in a nationwide
television broadcast, urging the miners to return to work to protect "
the life and prosperity of the nation . " he was still standing firm on
money : " the reasonable rhythm of salary increases prohibits giving
the miners what they ask . " all the government would promise was a 5.7
per cent boost spread over ten months .

west germany looking eastward for years, the west german
government has nursed a certain longing for closer ties with
neighboring eastern europe, in part because moscow's underdeveloped
satellites would be a juicy market for bonn's heavy industrial goods .
but communist poland, for one, kept insisting on a major political
surrender before any deal was signed : full diplomatic recognition of
wladyslaw gomulka's polish regime, and acceptance of poland's
oderneisse western frontier, which includes a big chunk of pre-world
war ii germany . with 14 million angry refugees from the east added to
its population since the war, the bonn government could hardly swallow
that kind of proposition . last week, after three months of delicate
negotiations in warsaw, poland at last dropped its tough demands, and
the two sides signed their first long-term trade agreement, a
three-year, $650 million pact exchanging west german machinery and
metals for polish meat, fruit and dairy products . west germany will
send a permanent trade mission to warsaw, its first permanent outpost
in a soviet satellite land . bonn officials clearly feel the way is
open for similar deals with hungary and czechoslovakia .

and easy remarks were merely signs of the relaxed and reflective mood
that has come over the 87-year-old chancellor now that he has finally
made up his mind to give up west germany's top job . last week he
offered no objections when a caucus meeting of his christian democrats
authorized c.d.u . bundestag leader heinrich von brentano to canvass
all the factions and suggest a candidate to take over next fall and
lead the party in the 1965 elections . the heir-apparent is still

death, there was not a single mention by press or radio of the man
nikita khrushchev once fulsomely praised as " our great leader, our

millions, only a single anonymous soul dared to pay respects with three
rubles worth of yellow mimosa on stalin's black marble slab near the

gushing stalin's praise . all over the country, monuments to the dead
dictator were hung with garlands of flowers ; tirana newspapers
published his picture and babbled their " love and profound respect for
his teachings . " red china might also have been expected to use the
occasion to glorify stalin's memory, but remembering the dictator's
open distrust of his asian comrades, peking chose not to be
hypocritical . instead, mao tse-tung took the occasion to launch his
toughest, most strident blast at moscow since the sino-soviet squabble
began . a 60,000-word broadside in peking's theoretical journal red
flag declared : " certain people, though calling themselves
marxist-leninists, are in fact muddleheaded ; they talk drivel . . .
they either make endless concessions to the enemy and thus commit the
error of capitulationism, or act recklessly and thus commit the error
of adventurism . " peking added contemptuously that communists like
russia's khrushchev, italy's togliatti and france's thorez, who
advocated " peaceful " revolution in the west, were guilty of "
parliamentary cretinism . " red china's new tone made the squabble for
supremacy in the communist world sound all but irreconcilable . " if it
is a case of masters wielding clubs over the heads of servants, calling
for unity, then what is actually meant is a split, " declared red flag
. switching to another metaphor, peking intoned ominously that " now
there are two watches " by which communists can tell the time . " which
is to be the master watch ? " moscow did not shout back last week ;
but it could not long remain silent, lest khrushchev appear to be the "
coward " that mao now called him . now that the chinese reds have
nailed their theses to the kremlin wall, some men in moscow would be
thinking of excommunication . stalin's posthumous excommunication took
only three years to accomplish, and already the sino-soviet quarrel has
rages for longer than that .

private businessman who was somehow able to supply products and
services the state-controlled organization could not match . but a year
or so ago, the profits of the barbers, blacksmiths, pastrymakers,
cobblers and tailors began to get out of hand ; they bought cars and
rented summer homes on fashionable lakesides . last may tito's regime
decided to wipe them out . taxes on private business were raised
sevenfold . a private tailor with one helper paid the same amount of
tax as a belgrade tailors' communist cooperative with seven employees .
it was too much for any artisan . by the end of 1962, nearly 10,000
private craftsmen closed up shop, 3,000 in croatia alone . the
theoreticians were happy at the turn of events, but many other
yugoslavs were not . they found it virtually impossible in some areas
to obtain the services of a plumber or electrician . to get a pair of
shoes repaired today takes a month . belgrade's famed candy and pastry
shops are nearly all closed, and the state-baked pita a serbian pastry
filled with fruit is no edible substitute . the grumbling got so loud
that even president tito admitted in a speech that " a real witch hunt
was started against the alleged enrichment of artisans, and excessively
high taxes were levied against them . " he suggested the matter be
attended to . last week the yugoslav parliament was preparing to pass a
new tax law that " will not discourage the development of crafts . "

east africa the asians in their midst for many european settlers,

painful though it may be . the future is far darker for the asians in
east africa, who have long formed a precarious middle class . despised
by color-conscious whites, whom they greatly outnumber (400,000 to
96,000), resented by east africa's 25 million blacks, the asians mostly
indians and pakistanis are loath to return to homelands that few have
seen, and where jobs are already critically scarce . for the great
majority of asians, there is no other alternative but to stay on in an
increasingly hostile africa where, as one western diplomat succinctly
said recently, they are " the hard upper rung against which the rising
african bumps his head . " exporting profits . though they have been
trading on the east coast of africa for centuries, most of east
africa's asians have taken root in this alien land only since 1895,
when the british brought in 32,000 indian workmen to build the
narrow-guage railway that opened the interior to colonization . asian
quickly turned from railroad building to trade, and so completely
dominated commerce that until 1919 the rupee was the official currency
of east africa . today, millionaire indian merchants and manufacturers
occupy some of nairobi's finest homes ; but the asians are for the
most part small shopkeepers duka wallahs to the africans and junior
civil servants, who have never found middleclass security in their
middle-class vocations . african nationalists have long complained that
the asians are a clannish, alien people whose only interest in africa
lies in the profits to be wrung from african customers . " the indians
are opportunists and quislings, " cries nyasaland's prime minister
hastings banda . " everywhere in the country they are taking business
from african businessmen . " the asians make a habit of shipping much
of their profit out of africa ; african politicians charged bitterly
last fall that their true loyalty was disclosed by the sums of money
that they raised for india during the border war with china . three
years ago, half of the asian merchants in uganda's buganda kingdom were
driven out of the country by a wave of ugly violence and a boycott of
asian shops . east africans were cheered last week by the departure

senegal only one hat three months ago, in a bitter end to a
beautiful friendship, poet-president leopold senghor of peanut-growing
senegal, on the west african coast, booted out of office his old
friend, premier mamadou dia, after dia had turned on senghor in an
attempted coup . last week, in a referendum run off while dia
languished behind the barbed wire of a military camp outside dakar
awaiting trial for treason, the 56-year-old senghor legalized his
position as senegal's strongman . while pro-senghor demonstrators
chanted, " a single hat on a single head, " more than 1,000,000
senegalese, shuffled to the polls and handed senghor a 99.5 per cent
oui on a new senghor-tailored constitution . true to the slogan, the
new charter scraps senegal's two-man, president-premier system in favor
of a single, strong presidency for senghor . the victory was resounding
proof of senghor's support among senegal's masses, and it is made all
the more impressive by the fact that he is a roman catholic in a 70 per
cent moslem land . but the outcome was also, in a sense, a painful
defeat for black africa's most distinguished intellectual . for it had
been the bespectacled senghor who originally installed senegal's
two-headed system of divided powers after leading the country into
independence 2f years ago . until he and dia fell out, french-oriented
senghor loftily ridiculed other french african nations that had chosen
one-man rule . now, whatever his continuing popularity at home, senghor
has probably lost some of his effectiveness as the leading spokesman
for political liberalism in former french africa . the brilliant
senghor's intellectual credentials are impressive indeed . his
muchdiscussed poetic works include chants d'ombre, ethiopiques and
nocturnes . with martinique's poet aime cesaire, senghor founded the
mystic philosophy of " negritude . " senghor was the first african ever
to win france's coveted agregation de grammaire academic degree, and he
served with distinction as a territorial member of the postwar french
national assembly . by all accounts, he has been brooding over the
political circumstances which forced him to end his 17-year friendship
with dia and take over as strongman . but senghor was not likely to let
his sense of guilt get him down . he is, after all, a strong admirer of
charles de gaulle, and modeled his new constitution partly on de
gaulle's design for the fifth republic in paris . perhaps with his
mentor in mind, senghor conceded in one of his poems that " absolute
power requires the blood of the most dear being . " in any case, by
week's end he had grandly christened senegal's new regime, " la
deuxieme republique .

great britain this happy breeding besides the fact that there will
always be one, cliches about england are almost infinite in variety .
it rains all the time ; the cooking is miserable nothing but mutton,
tea, suety puddings and, good lord, the beer is served warm . then
there is the stereotype british male : a stoical, pipe-puffing,
baggy-tweeds type who eschews sex for a rousing game of darts in the
local pub, and when he does indulge is awkward and passionless .
british women are, for lack of practice, frigid . none of these things
has ever been very true . but nowadays, as far as sex is concerned
anyway, britons are shattering the world's illusions about their
propensities and prowess . in the bargain, they are shocking themselves
. " are virgins obsolete . on the island where the subject has long
been taboo in polite society, sex has exploded on the national
consciousness and into national headlines . " are we going sex crazy
? " asks the london daily herald . " is chastity outmoded ? " asks
a school magazine for teen-agers . " are virgins obsolete ? " is the
question posed by the sober new statesman . the answers vary, but one
thing is clear : britain is being bombarded with a barrage of
frankness about sex and flooded with a public questioning of the
long-established victorian moral standards . wrote the archbishop of
canterbury, in a recent sunday times article, " today there is in our
society an immense outbreak of preoccupation with venus . there is a
dwelling upon sex : the sex problem, the adjustments of sex,
instruction for sex, adventures of sex, stories of sex, what to do with
sex, brighter and better sex . " and the candor with which the
once forbidden subject is being explored is positively
astonishing . it is the decorous british broadcasting corp . that leads
the discussion these days . bbc programs have included a lecture on the
arguments for premarital intercourse, a discussion of homosexuality
(known on the continent as le vice anglais), a drama about an
abortionist, and another play about men reminiscing about their past
sex life ( " her breasts could fill champagne glasses " ) . on the
popular satirical show that was the week that was, the young
establishment types poke a kind of sexual fun that would make america's
fcc boss newton minow turn pale . taking off on a government report
that one baby in every eight born in london is illegitimate,
brassy singer millicent martin lamented as she rocked a cradle : don't
you weep, my little baby cause you haven't got a dad . go to sleep, my
little baby, things aren't really quite so bad . there's no reason any
longer why you ought to feel so blue . the world is full of bastards
just like you . a debris of convictions . fact is, both on and off the
air waves, the british are deeply concerned with their search for what
some call " a new morality " to fit the hushed-up facts of life . " the
popular morality is now a wasteland, " said dr . george morrison
carstairs, 46, professor of psychological medicine at edinburgh
university, in a recent bbc lecture . " it is littered with the debris
of broken convictions . a new concept is emerging, of sexual
relationships as a source of pleasure, but also as a mutual
encountering of personalities in which each explores the other and at
the same time discovers new depths in himself or herself . " in a
violently controversial report, a group of the religious society of
friends attacked the onus attached to " a great increase in adolescent
sexual intimacy " and premarital affairs . " it is fairly common in
both young men and women with high standards of conduct and integrity
to have one or two love affairs, involving intercourse, before they
find the person they will ultimately marry, " said the report . this,
concluded the quaker report, is not such a sin . " where there is
genuine tenderness, an openness to responsibility and the seed of
commitment, god is surely not shut out . " a blessing . all the hubbub
over sex has, to be sure, caused a lot of misgivings, and few churchmen
share the quakers' liberal view . but most experts agree with writer v
. s . pritchett that " allowing for its crudities, the sexual
revolution has been one of the few blessings in the life of this
century . " they attribute the new sexual tolerance and the lessening
of victorian shame to a wide variety of combined causes : the heavy
impact of both world wars on the old morality, the emancipation of
women from the hearth, a gradual increase in coeducational schooling,
and even the fact that more britons travel abroad for holidays . but
exactly where the present orgy of introspection will lead not even the
experts can predict . what seems certain, however, is that the typical
englishman of a thousand cliches is doing no more than he ever did ;
he is merely hiding it less .

become all too clear that the recent flood of artistic expression
poetry readings before mass audiences, exhibits of modern paintings,
jazz imported from abroad, books and articles about the stalin terror
were becoming dangerous carriers of alien western ideas, shaking the
foundations of community society . destalinization, touched off by
nikita khrushchev himself at the 20th party congress in 1956, had gone
too far . nikita spared no group in the restless audience . writer ilya

which, said nikita, suggests political " impermanence and instability .
/ as for ehrenburg's memoirs, which have been running in the literary
journal novy mir, khrushchev remarked caustically, " one notices that
he depicts everything in grim tones . " khrushchev warned the veteran
ehrenburg against " slipping into an anti-communist position . " then
khrushchev turned on young poet evgency evtushenko : " he shows
vacillations, instability of views . . . i would like to advise comrade
evtushenko and other men of letters that they should not seek cheap
sensationalism . " everyone was aware, nikita announced, that
evtushenko recently told a paris audience that his poem, babi yar
(which drew fire from the kremlin), had been " criticized by dogmatists
. " such behind-the-back remarks in foreign countries will not do,
hinted the premier : " if the enemies of our cause begin to praise you
for works convenient to their purpose, then the people will justly
criticize you . so choose what suits you best . " love for trees .
khrushchev described with horror a recent jazz concert he attended ( "
one would have liked to hide, but there was no place to hide " ),
expressed deep distaste at such new dance crazes as the twist ( "
simply obscenities, some sort of frenzy, the devil knows what " ), and
turned on the painters and sculptors with undisguised fury . some, he
roared, seek inspiration in " rubbish heaps and stinking latrines, " or
/ present people in an intentionally ugly aspect . " such a man was
ernest neizvestny, a sculptor who has recently won wide acclaim in
moscow's art world with his provocative works . but to khrushchev, his
work was just a " nauseating concoction . it is a good thing we do not
have many such artists, " he said . just what were nikita's tastes ?
for a moment, his imagination took flight, as the audience listened
nervously : " recently i was watching the sun rise on a forest covered
in hoarfrost . i said to those with me : " look at those fir trees, at
their attire, at those snowflakes glistening in the rays of the sun .
how wonderfully beautiful that is ! ' yet the modernists and
abstractionists want to paint these fir trees with their roots in the
air, and they said this is new, progressive art . " time to shut up .
running through his speech was the clear suggestion that khrushchev
felt his own roots were in danger . too many of the intellectuals were
devoting their work to exposure of the excesses of terror in the stalin
era which was striking pretty close to home, since khrushchev had been
stalin's henchman throughout that period . " the question is sometimes
asked, " nikita admitted, " did the leading people of the party know
about the arrests at the time ? yes, they knew . but did they know
that completely innocent people were being arrested .? no, they did
not know . " anyone familiar with nikita's 1956 destalinization speech
to the 20th party congress knew this to be a lie, for he had openly
discussed stalin's murderous political purges of the 1930s . now, he
said, was the time to shut up about the dark chapters of history . "
all attention is being one-sidedly concentrated on lawlessness and the
abuse
of power . here one needs moderation . if all writers began to write
only on this topic, what sort of literature would there be .? who
would dash for it ? flies, enormous fat flies . every sort of
bourgeois scum from abroad will crawl toward it . " when khrushchev's
speech was over, the stunned audience left the hall wearing the old,
familiar stony stares of stalin's day . it would be hard to force them
all into public recantations ; in fact, a surprising number stayed
silent . but sure enough, some caved in quickly to the cultural purge .
within 48 hours, the moscow writers union had ousted its liberal
chairman, poet stepan shchipachov, and replaced him with a regime
trusty . and as for hapless ernest neizvestny, the sculptor denounced
personally by nikita, he soon showed up in pravda with an obedient
statement, hailing the " marxist-leninist world outlook " and promising
to " work more, better, more ideologically, more expressively .

/ get down to production " with the idea men out of the way,
khrushchev turned to the painful problem of russia's factories and
farms . casting about for a way to boost industrial output, the premier
called a special joint session of the communist party presidium and the
government's council of ministers, which announced creation of a new,
all-powerful supreme economic council, discarding at last the
discredited scheme for regional industrial autonomy that was installed
in 1957 . at the same meeting, khrushchev scrapped the last two years
of his much-touted seven-year plan (1964-65) and ordered the new
economic czars to get busy and draft a new set of quotas . the bouncy
premier also turned up at a moscow meeting of agricultural experts and
explained why he fired the soviet agriculture minister fornight ago
(time, march 15) . he spent too much time writing directives from
moscow and too little time on the road, inspecting the farms he was
ordering about . " the cows can't read directives, " scolded nikita . "
all they want is a just exchange : " you give me fodder, i give you
milk . " ' and of milk and meat, he admitted, there is " still very,
very little . we have already criticized the writers for bad works .
you obviously won't do as writers . better get down to production . "

middle east so near, yet so far as jubilant delegations
dashed betleen baghdad, damascus and cairo last week, the arab world
was awash with joy . crowds swarmed in the streets chanting the slogan,
/ unity, freedom, socialism ! " in cairo and damascus, mobs shouted,
/ nasser ! nasser ! union tomorrow ! " iraq's deputy premier ali
saleh saadi cried, " the arab world will now certainly unite . this is
an old aspiration . what is new is that it has now become possible . /
double path . ; the urge to merge brought syrian and iraqi leaders
flying to cairo for 15 hours of talks with egypt's president gamal
abdel nasser, the chief beneficiary of the downfall of anti-nasser
regimes in iraq and syria . but nasser had contributed little to the
victories that were actually won in both countries by a coalition of
nasserite army officer and politicians of the baath (renaissance)
party, which has long promoted the ideal of wahadi arabiya (arab
oneness) . though both groups have the same goal of unity, each
proposes a separate path . nasser believe in centralize , authoritarian
control . the baath party favors " collective leadership " and a
democratic parliamentary government . as the talks proceeded, syria's
deputy premier nihad elkassem reportedly forced the baathists in his
delegation to accept the nasserite proposals on a threat of resigning
from office . total adherence . the conferees were reported " in close
agreement' on a planned union that indicated compromises were being
made by both sides . if accepted by individual plebiscites, the union
would create a single arab state of 39 million people with an area as
flat as texas and more than twice its size, and an economy based on the
oil of iraq, the agriculture of syria, an the industry and cotton of
egypt . the agreement calls for a single political head (almost certain
to be nasser) and a central parliament based on population, which would
give egypt a two-thirds majority . this central state would be
responsible for 1) defense and foreign policy, 2) a socialist economic
framework, and 3) unified educational and cultural programs . but
within the union, each state would have its own elected popular
authority and its own parliament . not represented in the cairo talks
was primitive yemen, whose boss, abdullah sallal, is propped up by
20,000 egyptian soldiers, but sallal cabled cairo announcing his total
adherence to whatever is decided . but at week's end, the reported "
close agreement " had apparently run into a snag . the threepower talks
unexpectedly broke up and, according to a communique, will resume " in
a few days . " while trying, at least, to unite verbally in cairo,
iraq and syria were still busy last week consolidating their
revolutions at home . iraq, which has already executed 25 local
communist leaders, condemned to death another 51 . in feeble
retaliation, the soviet union created a small riot in moscow, where a
crowd of several hundred students (including some from arab countries)
was permitted to break windows and throw ink bottles at the iraqi
embassy . the new baghdad regime also finally settled the 18-month
kurdish rebellion by reaching basic agreement with kurdish leader
mustafa barzani on terms of 1) amnesty for all rebels, 2) release of
2,000 iraqi soldiers captured in battle, and 3) autonomy for the
nation's 1,500,000 kurds . in syria, tanks and armored cars were at
last withdrawn from damascus streets although patrols of steel-helmeted
troops still remained . reportedly, about 1,000 prisoners jammed the
jails, including 80 local communists . single floor . arab nations have
often combined before on paper without preventing the individual states
from going their own anarchic way . a single military command was
agreed upon as long ago as 1951 but never implemented . the new union
may eventually prove to be little more than another exercise in
rhetoric, but last week the news of its formation sent a thrill of
excitement through pronasser elements in jordan and saudi arabia, the
two remaining arab states whose leaders are vocally anti-nasser . some
people in the arab world predict that revolt will strike jordan within
a few weeks, and saudi arabia in a matter of months . jordan's young
king hussein, determined to nip any plot in the bud, spent last week
inspecting his jordanian troops and was greeted with cheers . jordan's
imprisoned baathist leader, rifat audeh, broke jail but was quickly
recaptured . in saudi arabia, premier prince feisal completed an
unprecedented speechmaking swing around the nation and announced that
9,000 men had volunteered for his new national guard . king saud,
however, played into the hands of the monarchy's critics when he
proposed continiing his extravagant four-month convalescence (from
heart and political failures) by moving from switzerland to the french
riviera . for this week, saud has made reservations at nice's hotel
negresco for himself and 130 relatives and retainers, who will occupy
all 50 rooms on a single floor, with a special elevator reserved for
his personal use .

france " give us some sous " as dawn rose over paris early
one morning last week, a volley of rifle shots echoed through dank,
grim ivry fort . dead before the firing squad sank ex-lieut . colonel
jean-marie bastien-thiry, 35, convicted ringleader of last summer's
abortive attempt to assassinate charles de gaulle in the paris suburb
of petitclamart as he was motoring to his country home at
colombey-les-deux-eglises. though de gaulle spared two other plotters,
he presumably ordered the execution of bastien-thiry to discourage
other terrorists from further assassination efforts on behalf of the
dread secret army organization . but de gaulle's most prominent foe,
ex-premier georges bidault, now a ranking s.a.o . chieftain, was as
publicly defiant as ever . he could afford to be, for he was now holed
up in southern germany, where, after a nervous brushoff by chancellor
konrad adenauer, he sought political asylum from the state of bavaria .
bathed in publicity and surrounded by police, he obviously was not
doing his resistance organization much concrete good in a distant
german villa . but when he called reporters in for interviews, bidault
insisted that his political activities were far from over . " i am the
leader of the national resistance council . i am the boss of it all, "
he boasted . in france, there was only official silence . fact was, the
french government was delighted that the troublemaker was in germany,
where he was under continual surveillance, and was babbling a little
too much to the press to enhance his reputation . with bidault on ice,
de gaulle turned his attention to the continuing, crippling strike of
188,000 miners in the nationalized coal fields of northern france, who
were demanding wage scales on a par with workers in private industry .
rumors circulated that s.a.o . members, disguised as cops, would attack
the strikers to provoke them to violence against the government, but
the only toll of the strike so far was economic . thousands of steel
and natural gas workers went out on a sympathy strike, and a 24-hour
rail walkout created a transportation tie-up all over france . into
paris drove a 342-car convoy of some 2,000 lorraine ironworkers
chanting : " give us some sous, pompidou . " though furious at the
continued intransigence of the strikers, de gaulle knew he might have
to give in. at a cabinet meeting in paris, he ordered studies drawn up
comparing wages in private and government-owned industry, with an eye
toward making adjustments . but he was still rankled at the monetary
support given the strikers by the roman catholic church in the northern
coal areas . asked where the funds would come from to pay for any wage
hike, he suggested we could always take up a collection in the churches
these days, with tighter
police security, de gaulle usually makes the trip between paris and
colombey by helicopter . escorted by a heavy police guard, he drives a
few miles down the highway to an isolated, predetermined spot on the
road . there, as shown with mme . de gaulle in photographs released
this week (see cuts), he leaves his car, enters the waiting helicopter,
and makes his journey .
for one thing, le grand charles was doubtless aware of the latest
report of the french institute of public opinion, which revealed that
de gaulle's rating had plummeted nine points over the preceding month,
with only 55 per cent of the french populace now " satisfied " with his
conduct of the presidency . it was de gaulle's lowest reading in 14
months .

somalia who owns what ? it was 9 o'clock on a hot, equatorial
night, and the locals were living it up outside passoni's grocery store
on the potholed main drag of mogadishu, capital of somalia . italian
settler passoni, an enterprising sort, was raffling off boxes of
groceries . suddenly, a news bulletin from neighboring kenya blared
from a radio in a bar next door . an instant later, the guttural
twitter that is the somali tongue became an ominous muttering, and the
crowd of 500 was on the rampage . stoning cars, the somalis marched to
the british embassy, touching off three days of shouting,
window-smashing riots . matter of heritage . what set off the explosion
was announcement by british colonial secretary duncan sandys that a
slice of scrub and sand which borders on somalia would be made one of
seven provinces of kenya, which is due to get independence next year
(time, march 15) . as it happens, kenya's northeast has long been a
favorite squatting ground for nomadic somali tribesmen, who herd their
camels and goats back and forth across the horn of africa without heed
to national borders . fiercely independent, the illiterate moslem
tribesmen fight savagely among themselves for grazing land, for this is
the possession they hold most dear . a proud people, tall, lithe and
fine-featured, the somalis are hamitic in origin, descended in part
from 7th century arabs who crossed into africa from yemen . forever
vain about their heritage, they are also accustomed to having their own
way . the somalis began running into the stubborn objections of others
shortly after somalia (pop . 2,000,000) won independence in 1960 and
began building a nation out of former italian somalia and british
somaliland . emperor haile selassie coldly said no to somalia's
insistence on annexation of an ethiopian border area containing
1,000,000 somalis . france likewise refused to give up french
somaliland, where 600,000 somalis live . and though the bleak, barren
slice of territory inside kenya harbors 200,000 somalis, kenya's black
nationalist leaders, led by ex-mau mau chieftain jomo ( " burning spear
/ ) kenyatta, have always vowed that loss of their northeast corner
would mean war with their own black rendilles, who cover themselves
with feathers ; with their turkanas, who wear little except mud hats
; and with the marilles, who wear only rifles . thus, britain's sandys
was bound to make enemies and to risk violence no matter what his
decision about kenya's frontier . spearing the commissioner . no somali
saw it that way . mobs surging through mogadishu's heat (100o plus) had
to be broken up by mounted police swinging long batons ; before the
disturbance was quelled, some 500 people were arrested . in hargeisa,
the onetime capital of british somaliland, crowds stoned british homes
and cars, attacked the british consulate . presumably because of
britain's close ties to the u.s., newly arrived u.s . ambassador horace
torbert was stoned out of the town of galcaio, his land-rover narrowly
outdistancing a mob of 1,000 men, women and children . in kenya itself,
a somali tribesman speared a district commissioner, lieut . colonel
john balfour, and one mob hauled down the union jack . restoring
internal order with troops, somalia's premier abdirashid ali shermarke
called the national assembly into session, demanded that " relations
with britain be revised . " as the debate droned on, the british hoped
that passions might cool . but at week's end the outraged deputies
voted 74 to 14 to break off diplomatic relations with london, though it
seemed clear that consular ties would be retained ; such a compromise
appeared appropriate in view of the fact that the british were to
supply somalia with $3,600,000 in aid this year . with a sigh and a
shrug, britain's mogadishu embassy began packing up, and in london the
british government suggested that it " will at an appropriate time "
reconsider the whole
northeast kenya question .

israel jew against jew in the four-month trial of adolf eichmann,
one dark chapter of the nazi holocaust was never fully brought out :
the rule of nazi-organized councils of jewish elders in european
ghettos . backed by their own high-booted jewish police, the councils
compiled death lists of jews and rounded up their own people for
deportation to nazi extermination camps . refusal to help eichmann's "
transportation " experts would have meant immediate death, but always
there was the agonizing moral dilemma : even under duress, was
cooperation not betrayal ? last week israeli prosecutor david libai
gave the state's answer in the first trial of a jewish policeman who
served the nazis . its answer was yes . in the dock of a tiny, drab tel
aviv courtroom, head buried in his hands, sat the assistant conductor
of the israel national opera, hirsch barenblat, 48, former commander of
the jewish police in bedzin, poland . for two years after he managed to
get to israel in 1958, barenblat attracted no particular attention .
then, during introductions at a concert in a kibbutz, a member of the
audience suddenly leaped up and shouted : " barenblat, i remember you
! you murdered jews ! " the concert broke up amidst angry confusion
. in 1961, after a police investigation, barenblat was arrested and
charged under the israeli law punishing nazis and their collaborators
who were members of " hostile organizations " the same law under which
eichmann was tried as a gestapo member, and which the government now
wants extended to include the jewish police . in barenblat's case, the
maximum penalty would be seven to ten years in prison on each of twelve
specific accusations of persecution . on the opening day of what looked
to be a drawn-out trial, a tel aviv carpenter tearfully recalled that
barenblat's jewish police once trooped back from a round-up in bedzin "
loudly singing, as if from a victorious engagement, " described how
they herded jewish men, women and children into trucks headed for
auschwitz . " even the streets wept, " the witness said . prosecutor
libai conceded that barenblat saved " maybe ten or 20 jews, " but added
: " this court will have to decide whether to save his own soul he was
entitled to carry out the tasks of the jewish police . " defense
attorney arieh rosenblum, supporting barenblat's plea of innocence,
said that his conduct was justifiable, and argued that he was acquitted
of collaborationist charges after the war by a polish court . " the
jewish police, " rosenblum said, " cannot be regarded as hostile to the
jewish people . their intention was not hostility . they did not seek
to exterminate jews ; they served what they deemed the best interests
of the jewish community under the worst possible circumstances . "

iran water & blood on a platform jutting from a sheer,
1,500-ft . gorge in the zagros mountains, the shah of iran picked up a
ceremonial telephone and spoke an order . seconds later, tons of water
from the ab-i-diz river below crashed through sluice gates and began
turning giant dynamos . a knot of cabinet ministers, diplomats and
engineers burst into hat-waving cheers as, down in the canyon,
electricity began flowing into moslem villages that had never before
known the magic of plug-in power . thus last week iran's huge, $67.2
million " mohammed reza shah pahlevi dam, " highest in the middle
east, went into operation as another feather in the crown of the
country's 43-year-old reform-minded monarch . to help finance the dam,
the world bank loaned iran $42 million, but the rest of the cash came
from the shah's $300 million annual oil revenues . to oversee the
project, iran picked two ex-chairmen of the u.s.'s tennessee valley
authority, david e . lilienthal and gordon r . clapp, who now head a
manhattan-based consulting firm . last week's inauguration was right on
schedule, just one year and five months after the first concrete was
poured . the dam's principal purpose is to bring fertility back to
desolate khuzistan province, an area the size of michigan in southwest
iran, near the persian gulf . twenty-five centuries ago, khuzistan was
the fabled fertile granary of the ancient persian empire . but the
region has since eroded into a virtual wasteland ; the last major
reclamation attempt was a system of irrigation canals dug by king
shapur ii in 300 a.d . the new dam will water 360,000 acres, and
provide electricity even for the provinces remotest villages and five
cities, including the oil-refining center of abadan, opening the way
for industrialization . in the long run, iran hopes to build 13 more
dams to irrigate much of the semi-arid land currently being handed out
to peasants under the shah's big agrarian reform program, which was
approved 1,000to-1 in a national referendum in january . with the
nation behind him, the shah has pushed steadily ahead with his land
split-up, despite loud outcries from the big landowners . a few weeks
ago, one outraged group, the nomadic qashqai (pronounced gosh guy)
tribesmen, who herd cattle in the southern province of fars, registered
its protest by attacking iranian police posts, killing ten officers and
men . when the dissident qashqai refused to surrender and were joined
by malcontents of two other tribes, the shah grimly ordered his air
force to crush the revolt . peeling out of the sun, his u.s.made f-86
jets last week flashed down on the rebels with bombing and strafing
runs that left an estimated 150 tribesmen sprawled dead in the plains .

middle east the camel driver (see

small office off the bedroom of egypt's president gamal abdel nasser .
already awake, he lifted the receiver to hear exciting news : a
military coup had just been launched against the anti-nasser government
of syria . the phone rang again . it was the minister of culture and
national guidance . how should radio cairo handle the syrian crisis ?
support the rebels, snapped nasser . then egypt's boss rapped out a
succession of telephoned commands . to the air force : alert the
bombers and fighters in case the syrian rebels call for help . to the
navy (six destroyers and ten submarines) : steam northward and await
orders . to the army : prepare to move in case the israelis might be
thinking of intervention ; place missiles on launch pads ready to fire
. this done, nasser finished dressing and went downstairs . the phone
rang again, long distance from baghdad . president abdul salam aref,
who only four weeks before had overthrown another anti-nasser regime in
iraq, solicitously asked what nasser intended doing about syria .
nasser said that he would recognize a rebel government as soon as it
was formed . aref delicately responded that of course, egypt should be
the first state to grant recognition, promised that iraq would follow
suit five minutes later . limb from limb . since the syrian coup was
both swift and successful, nasser's nerves and the egyptian army were
not put to the test . israel alerted its border defenses but made no
further move . on the surface, in fact, the syrian affair was much
milder and less bloody than most arab revolts . in the past 15 years,
the middle east has been continually shaken like a kaleidoscope,
constantly falling into new patterns . there have been two sizable wars
and fully two dozen armed uprisings and rebellions . premiers and
princes have been torn limb from limb by street mobs ; thousands of
politicians and army officers have been killed by hanging, beheading,
firing squads and assassins ; and swarms of students, workers and
tribesmen have been mowed down by machine guns and bombs . it was quite
clear last week that the latest shake of the kaleidoscope resulted in
new patterns and alignments overwhelmingly favorable to gamal abdel
nasser . the syrian revolution was the third in six months by rebels
pledged to make common cause with egypt . flights of new leaders poured
into cairo for tearstained embraces with nasser and nightlong
conferences on the future course of that misty concept called arab
unity . nasser stands at the pinnacle of prestige, if not of power, and
the shadow he casts has never been longer . today, it falls over the
entire arab world from the persian gulf to the atlantic ocean . matter
of sabotage ? for the first time in 500 years, the three key arab
states of egypt, iraq and syria have a similar political posture and
are on close and friendly terms . the new crowd in primitive yemen,
where 28,000 egyptian troops are propping up still another pronasser
rebellion, is eager to join any alliance that can be hammered out . the
monarchies of saudi arabia and jordan close friends of the west but
hated enemies of the arab nationalists face the threat of uprisings at
the hands of powerful local friends of the man in cairo . when king
saud's private comet plane, equipped with a royal throne, crashed last
week against an italian mountain, killing all 18 aboard, the saudi
arabs automatically assumed that it had been sabotaged by nasser agents
maybe it was and maybe it was not . in the
swirling middle east struggle, cairo would flex its muscles where it
could . the successful coups in yemen, syria and iraq were no surprise
to gamal abdel nasser . he knew they were coming, if not precisely when
and how . he knew the conspirators involved in each, though he claims
to have pulled no strings . cairo is thickly populated by exiles from
every corner of the arab world, ranging from syria's tough abdul hamid
serraj, who originally failed nasser in damascus, to obscure tunisians,
yemenis, saudis, jordanians and refugees from the britishbacked
sheikdoms of the persian gulf . many of them live well on egyptian
subsidies . former saudi petroleum minister abdullah tariki is in and
out of cairo frequently, helping organize arms shipments to saudi
arabian dissidents by air and across the long, empty border with kuwait
. nasser has won over saudi arabia's ambassador to west germany, who
resigned a fortnight ago in protest at his country's failure to
institute reforms . at least six other saudi ambassadors are
sympathetic to nasser's cause accented voice . all the arab world is
influenced by nasser's genius as a propagandist . rising to share
cairo's skyline with the huge dome of the mohammed ali mosque is a
forest of transmitting antennas that carry radio cairo's message to all
the world . cairo's voice bears many accents . there is the overt voice
of the arabs, and a whole concatenation of " voices " (voice of the
arab nation, free voice of iran, voice of free africa, etc.), which
bleat incitement to rebellion with no identification of their egyptian
origin . the transmitting complex is elaborate and devilishly clever .
recently, somali-language transmissions have supported the claims of
somalia to a portion of northeast kenya, while swahili broadcasts aimed
at kenya denounce the idea . a u.s . construction firm is building a
new transmitter, which will be beamed at tunisia and aimed at
destroying president habib bourguiba . egyptian tv, the liveliest in
the middle east, manages to keep three channels busy 20 hours a day,
while kinescopes subtly loaded with nasser propaganda are shipped out
to algeria, kuwait and lebanon . nasser has collected the best
entertainers in the arab world, and uses them superbly . when um
kalsoum sings we revolutionists, the bedouins in the desert are deeply
stirred . one of the most popular songs among arab kids is how we build
the high dam at aswan . every transistor radio in the middle east is a
nasser agent . when yemen revolted against the imam, nasser sent them
arms and transistors . arab communists who broadcast long, windy
speeches from bulgaria have not a chance against nasser's entertainers
. fire striker . but nasser's triumphs are not solely the result of
subversion and pop singers . his very example is an inspiration . he
has been the uncontested ruler of egypt for almost a decade, ever since
february 1954, when he put down a revolt of cavalry officers and
consolidated his regime . during that time, the old political remnants
such as the wafdists have disappeared and even been forgotten . it is
nasser whose personality stands above all others in egypt and the arab
world, and no other name strikes fire like his . he is hailed as the
man who destroyed egypt's corrupt past and gave arabs a new dignity .
his picture, with its pepsodent smile, is found in every corner of the
middle east, from iraqi bazaars to the huts of royalist yemeni
tribesmen who still cling to nasser's picture even though they are
fighting nasser's troops .
what nasser has working for him is the deep
desire of all arabs to be united in a single arab nation, and their
conviction grudging or enthusiastic that nasser represents the best
hope of achieving it . this dream of unity harks back to the golden age
of the 7th century when, spurred by the messianic moslem religion
handed down by mohammed the prophet, arab warriors burst from their
desert peninsula and conquered everything in sight . in less than 150
years, the arabs swept victoriously north to asia minor and the walls
of byzantine constantinople, south over persia and afghanistan to the
heart of india, east through central asia to the borders of china, west
over egypt and africa to spain and southern france . it was an
incredible empire larger than any carved out by alexander the great or
imperial rome . it was also an empire that fell swiftly apart . by the
16th century, the arab states, one by one, fell to the ottomans and
passed into the long sleep of turkish domination . then, in world war
i, arab nationalists rebelled against their turkish overlords and
fought beside the british armies in the middle east, confident that
they would obtain unity and freedom . moviegoers who have seen lawrence
of arabia know the gloomy result : under league of nation mandates,
most of the middle east was handed over to britain and france, and
frustrated arabs wasted themselves in futile rebellions against the
colonial powers . world war ii did little better for the arab
nationalists . individual states gained independence, but control was
securely held by feudal monarchs or coalitions of landowners and
businessmen who were often little more than colonial puppets . sir
winston churchill " invented " the state of jordan " on a sunday
afternoon in jerusalem . " even worse, in the arab view, was the
partition of palestine to provide a national homeland for the jews .
humiliation became complete in 1948, when the combined armies of the
arab countries were crushingly defeated by the israelis . moon orbit .
hence the enormous prestige nasser won in 1956, when he survived the
massed assault of britain, france and israel in the suez war . arabs
ignored the fact that the egyptians were beaten in the field and that
only intervention by the u.s . and the soviet union saved nasser from
collapse . what mattered was that nasser had engaged the imperialists
and israel in battle, and managed to survive . when egypt later proved
that it had the technical skill to operate the suez canal efficiently
on its own, arab nationalists were as proud as if nasser had personally
orbited the moon . his arab brethren also share pride in nasser's
achievements at home in the years since suez . cairo, a city as
populous as chicago, has become a bustling, busy metropolis . new
skyscrapers line the banks of the nile, throwing glittering light on
the river at night and by day reflecting in their glass walls the
stately grace of the sails of feluccas headed upriver with cargoes of
wheat and lime . the building boom is not confined to the hotels, which
were host this winter to a record half-million tourists . on the edge
of the city, entire new suburbs are in being or abuilding . at medinet
el waqf, egypt's new managers are housed in modern stucco cottages . on
the northern rim of the city, 40,000 low-cost housing units were
erected last year . but most of cairo remains the same : close,
crowded and cacophonous with hard-pressed auto horns . in imbaba, on
the west bank of the nile, camels streaked with henna still plod
unknowingly toward the slaughterhouse, and gully-gully men delight
bright-eyed, brown-faced children with magic tricks as they did their
grandfathers 50 years ago . imbaba's junk market is still unchanged,
and bent nails and half-shoelaces are traded with solemnity and
diligence . the red flowerpot of the tarboosh has all but vanished from
cairenes' heads, and nasser has even made considerable progress in his
campaign to get his city folk to switch to european clothes from the
nightshirt-like gallabiya . most astonishing is the fact that a visitor
seldom sees a barefoot man, woman or child . even urchins from the
cairo slums wear shoes and socks . today cairo walks well-dressed,
well-shod and bareheaded, with its shoulders back .
swallowed revenues . of all egyptians, the
industrial worker has fared the best under nasser . next to him comes
the fellah, the timeless peasant working the timeless land . it was the
jest of 1952 that nasser's foremost ambition was to raise the fellahin
at least to the living standard of the gamoosa, the water buffalo of
the nile . he has more than succeeded . you can see it simply in the
fellah's clothes . but also the fellah, who used to have meat only once
or twice a year, now eats it at least once a week . in pre-nasser
egypt, the most common characteristic of the fellahin was summed up in
the phrase anna mali, which roughly translates, " i couldn't care less
. " today the word heard over and over is nahdha, a term meaning to sit
up and take notice of the world around you . egypt has been awake,
taking notice and participating since the hot summer morning in july
1952, when nasser and a group of young army officers put an end to the
regime of king farouk . the resulting economic upsurge was hardly
accomplished by egypt alone . the intense development campaign
swallowed up revenues from the suez canal, and from the biggest crop,
cotton . in the process, the nation has spent its savings . egypt's
foreign-exchange reserves, which stood at a billion dollars after world
war ii, have dwindled to scarcely $10 million . the consequence is an
increasing dependence on foreign aid . the communist bloc has committed
itself to $700 million in economic aid since 1955, and russia is
footing the bill for the famed high dam at aswan, which by 1972 will
increase the arable land of egypt from 6,000,000 acres to 8,000,000
acres and supply 10 billion kw-h in electric power . since 1945, the
u.s . has supplied egypt with $628.6 million, mostly in the form of
surplus food paid for in egyptian pounds, 85 per cent of which can be
(and is) loaned back to egypt . today, egypt is dependent on the u.s .
for its food, and on russia for its arms and the aswan dam . the fact
is that nasser is not totally dependent on any one power or group of
powers . he is still determinedly nonaligned . but things are better
than the word implies . a few years ago, nasser was nonaligned toward
the east ; today, he is more accurately regarded as nonaligned toward
the west . happy nausea . but nasser's one-man rule has not brought
unmitigated bliss to egypt . the banks and insurance companies were
nationalized, and their owners paid off partly in bonds that may not be
redeemed for years to come . contractors whose earnings reach $69,000 a
year are taken over, or forced to accept joint participation by the
government . wiped out are the great landowners ; farm holdings are
now limited to 100 acres per family . this form of socialism is benign
enough . it leaves most of the nation's commerce in private hands and
does not affect the overwhelming number of small farmers, who own far
less than 100 acres . the press was nationalized in 1960, and its
editors are picked by the regime ,; they, of course, do not criticize
nasser's policies . political activity in the usual sense is banned
because, as nasser puts it, " if i had three political parties, one
would be run by the rich, one by the soviets, and one by the u.s . "
the only party permitted by law is the official arab socialist union,
which is supposed to provide democracy by its representation in every
village, factory and urban district . there, leaders are chosen to
pass local views along to provincial and national committees .
nasser's revolution
has never been particularly
totalitarian, but there was a
nasty period in late 1961, when syria
broke away from egypt . hundreds of
people, including army officers, were arrested . foreign diplomats were
shadowed by secret police . but since then, the atmosphere of fear has
largely vanished . general mohammed naguib, the 1952 revolution's first
leader, who served for two years as a front for nasser and was then
deposed, still lives quietly in a cairo villa near the nile and is
permitted to move fairly freely about the city . old nahas pasha and
other former wafdist enemies of the new regime remain in their homes,
which, in most cases, they have been allowed to keep . nasser's
government has moved impressively into the fields of education and
health . primary schools were erected and staffed at a rate of two
every three days . education is free, and egypt's universities are
crammed with 126,000 students, including 20,000 from other arab lands .
improved hygiene and free clinics have only increased the population
pressure : the new arable land to be provided by the aswan dam will be
barely enough to feed the estimated 55 million population in 20 years .
in sort, at tremendous cost, egypt will not have gone forward but
merely stood still with this challenge, nasser has begun a nationwide
birth control campaign . oral contraceptives are being sold below cost
(a month's supply for 46 #$ ), and egyptian women are said to relish
the pills because they induce the same feeling of nausea experienced in
pregnancy .
the pressure of egypt's millions, in fact, is one of the
things that makes other arab states wary of being too closely embraced
by nasser . egypt, like china, is always threatening to spill over its
borders into the relatively empty land of its neighbors .
individualistic arabs, as well, are nervously concerned about
disappearing into the straitjacket of nasser's oneman rule . laps of
generals . to these dissenters, there is another flashing beacon of
arab unity : the baath (renaissance) party, which dominates the new
governments in both iraq and syria . the street mobs and impatient
young army officers may worship nasser, but arab students and
intellectuals bow before the creator of baath, a tiny, beak-nosed,
meek-chinned syrian named michel aflak . aflak, 53, an arab christian
who counts his amber worry beads three at a time, shuns crowds and
holds no post in any government, makes an incongruous rival to the
brash, burly, good-looking nasser . no crowds have ever shrieked over
him, chanted his name or paraded his picture . he lives in a small,
cramped damascus apartment with a frayed carpet, cheap furniture, and
clothes drying on a balcony washline . his two infant children toddle
about and, last week, clambered on the laps of generals and cabinet
ministers who crowded aflak's parlor . the son of a nationalist-minded
shopkeeper, aflak passionately embraced the ideal of arab unity as a
damascus schoolboy . his education at the sorbonne in paris, where he
graduated with honors in history, was financed by a successful uncle
who had emigrated to brazil . after a brief teaching career at a
damascus lycee, aflak resigned in 1942 to devote his life to politics
and to his personal creation, the baath party . what aflak created was
a mystic and lyrical hymn to wahadi arabiya (arab oneness), and he
overflows with such sentiments as " nationalism is love before
everything else, " and " a new page is open, the page of those who walk
with naked souls as if they were in their own bedroom . " he defines
revolution as " that powerful psychic current, that mandatory struggle,
without which the reawakening of a nation cannot be understood . " the
baath slogan, " unity, freedom, socialism, " was blandly appropriated
by nasser for his own use, but nasser has shown no eagerness to take
over other baath tenets, such as free elections, free press, and
freedom of speech and assembly . from syria, baathism moved swiftly to
iraq and jordan, more slowly to kuwait and saudi arabia . although the
party is antibourgeois, most of its adherents come from middle-class
intellectuals and small shopkeepers . baath made conservative
governments nervous with its socialism (which is actually a blend of
mild marxism and the new deal), and was attacked by the communists as a
deviating exponent of weak liberalism . in syria, during the course of
14 years and nine different coups, the baath party bobbed up and down .
not until 1958, when syria's communists were plotting an armed
takeover, were the baathists able to stampede syrian conservatives into
accepting unity with egypt as the lesser evil . slipped border . unity
was obtained, but at a high price . once in control, nasser insisted on
the abolition of all parties, baath included, and fixed on syria the
same tight controls and security-police system as in egypt . designated
as the northern region of the united arab republic, syria was flooded
by officious egyptian brass and cramped by nasser's authoritarian
economic schemes . syrian officers who protested found themselves
transferred to duty deep in egypt ; civilians quickly landed in jail .
at last, even michel aflak rebelled and ordered the baath cabinet
ministers to resign in a body, setting the stage for syria's angry
secession from the u.a.r .
in iraq the baath party faced crisis from the
moment dictator karim kassem established his bloody dictatorship in
1958 . the baathists participated in an armed revolt in the oil center
of mosul, which kassem savagely suppressed with the help of iraq's
communist militia . a baathist group tried to kill kassem, but failed
and was butchered . finally, last month, baathist politicians and
pro-nasser military men organized and executed the coup that resulted
in
the death of kassem and the slaughter of hundreds of his communist
allies . four weeks later with far less blood baathists and pro-nasser
officers in damascus brushed aside the conservative government of syria
. the way at last was open for the unity that everyone had been talking
about . complete lesson . the difficulty, of course, is that everyone
wants unity on his own terms . even jordan's king hussein, who is
anathema to nasser and the baathists, says he hopes for eventual
reconciliation with his enemies and admission of jordan into the arab
union . if necessary, hussein told newsmen, he would abdicate to
achieve arab unity . but he quickly added, " provided it's unity on a
proper basis . " michel aflak replies : " jordan and saudi arabia are
welcome to join the arab union, but not with their present regimes and
rulers . " in cairo president nasser has given every indication that he
intends to avoid the mistakes made during the hurried and ill-fated
union with syria . " the main reason for the lack of success, " nasser
told time last week, " was that we accepted complete union and
amalgamation, instead of federation and self-government in both states
. " to begin discussion of a better system, iraqi and syrian
delegations flew into cairo fortnight ago for preliminary talks with
nasser . last week an even more high-powered group of syrians arrived,
headed by michel aflak and premier salah el-bitar, with the intention
of laying down a solid foundation for the proposed unity structure .
this week another set of delegates from syria and iraq will return to
cairo, each bringing a draft project for a new union . noise in aleppo
. it seems unlikely that any kind of federation with centralized
authority will emerge . what is possible is a loose alliance, with
harmonized defense and foreign policies . there might also be a degree
of economic cooperation among the three nations, possibly including
even yemen, which is so backward that it has been described as "
rushing into the 13th century . " such a system of sovereign states
would represent a tacit admission that arabs are not all alike and that
their interests do not always coincide . the fact that the talks
between syrians, iraqis and egyptians have not yet produced anything
concrete is less important than the fact that they are, at least,
talking to one another and not screaming imprecations as they have done
so often in the past . but already some arabs were becoming impatient .
there were pro-nasser demonstrations in the syrian port of aleppo . in
damascus a tough young nasserite who had moved directly from a prison
cell to an ornate government office dismissed the baathists as
ideologists, not political leaders . " we are going to run syria with
nasser the way we want, " he said . " we are going to unite with egypt
the way nasser wants . " blasting paths ? the fact that the middle
east is so consistently combustible and has so low an ignition point
makes its affairs of deep importance to other powers . in the old city
of jerusalem last week, arabs were jarred by recurrent dull explosions
in the border areas, and there was speculation that israeli demolition
squads were blowing up old mines in noman's land to clear lanes for an
advance into jordan should king hussein be overthrown by nasserites .
israel is not impressed by suggestions that egypt's ruler has
given up his domineering ways . one official in tel aviv warned : "
nasser finds it difficult to resist temptation . success turns his
head, and being basically a military man, he thinks in terms of
external expansion . " the israeli government sees a hint of nasser's
dreams of grandeur in his yemen adventure, which has already tied up
one-third of his army israel's stated policy is that any change in the
internal situation of her arab neighbors affecting the security of her
borders would free israel of her undertaking to maintain the status quo
. many arabs fear that israel would move troops straight to the west
bank of the jordan river . if hussein's regime collapses . fat or thin
. britain's
present relations with egypt are correct but cool . while recognizing
nasser's pre-eminence in the arab world and his great abilities, the
british remain wary of the man and his policies . understandably,
britain is worried about the future of its few remaining middle east
colonies and its important oil interests . " nasser's own stand on oil
is ambiguous, " complains one diplomat . " of course, he would like to
control oil-rich kuwait, but so would everyone else . " british and u.s
. oil executives, though admitting to some uneasiness about nasser's
intentions, see no immediate threat to the middle east's daily flow of
6,500,000 bbl . " we have learned to live with political instability, "
says one oilman stoically . their fear is not that the west will lose
access to the middle east's proven oil reserves of 194 billion bbl.,
but that any new arab grouping might start a campaign to reduce the
producer's profits . " arab unity may be good or bad for the oil
industry, " explained one official . " it depends on the goals of unity
and these are difficult to discern in the present situation . " drawn
line . sharply hostile after nasser's suez nationalization, and nervous
at his flirtation with the communists, u.s . policy more recently has
turned in nasser's favor . recalling the days not so long ago when
cairo radio was spouting ugly lies about the u.s., washington is not
inclined to be nasser's sponsor . but the u.s . can cooperate with the
man whose name is on every arab lip . officially, the u.s . aims at
assisting any government, no matter what its form, that appears to be
sincerely and effectively working for internal development and the good
of its people . with indifference to social systems, the u.s . has
aided egypt on the left and iran on the right, recognized the
monarchies of jordan and saudi arabia as well as pro-nasser yemen . but
there is a line drawn by the u.s . " if the cold war in the arab world
threatens the large american interests in, say, saudi arabia, we'll
have to take a stand, " says a u.s . official . similarly, the u.s .
considers itself nonaligned in the struggle between israel and the arab
world . washington's attitude toward arab union is still tied to a
pronouncement made by secretary of state john foster dulles during the
eisenhower administration . dulles said then, and it was repeated last
week in washington, that the u.s . looks with favor on any movement
toward arab union that is not imposed from outside the arab world .
great coups . nasser today takes an indulgent view of the u.s . his
earlier resentments, he says, resulted from american attempts to force
egypt into joining such " imperialist " groupings as the mediterranean
defense organization and the baghdad pact . nasser applauds the present
administration in washington because " kennedy tried from the first to
understand us and to be realistic when facing the arab world . under
john foster dulles, the u.s . withdrew its aid for the aswan dam, we
faced blockade and even the blocking of our own money in u.s . banks .
/ however, nasser concedes, " it should not be forgotten that the u.s .
stood by us in the united nations during the suez crisis, and that left
a good impression . " president nasser and president kennedy have
become close correspondents . " we are very frank with each other, "
says nasser . " we don't exchange diplomatic words but express honest
and frank opinions . i believe we have built up a confidence in each
other . " the confidence extends to u.s . ambassador john badeau, who
speaks fluent arabic and has unlimited access to nasser, while his
british counterpart sees nasser only twice a year at formal meetings .
the communists are so convinced that the u.s . controls events in the
middle east that the polish ambassador in cairo stopped a u.s .
diplomat at the entrance to a luncheon party and said bitterly : " i
must congratulate you on your tremendous achievements in iraq and syria
. you have made two great coups . " jiggled leg . at week's end in
cairo, the conferences on arab unity droned on to the accompaniment of
cigarette smoke and endless small cups of coffee . nasser sat in on the
negotiations, serenely confident that what finally emerged would be
what he wanted . at 45, nasser's hair has greyed at the temples, and he
has given up tennis for the less demanding sport of swimming . he
appears as physically fit as ever and retains his old nervous habits of
jiggling his leg while sitting, and of smoking five packs of l . & m.s
a day ; like most egyptians, he cannot stand the local brands . he
still works twelve and 18 hours at a clip and is still the only man in
the government who can be reached at any hour . a close aide says : "
i've never heard of anyone getting chewed out for calling nasser in the
middle of the night . i do know of many who have been given unshirted
hell for not calling him when something happened . he won't like you to
say this, but it is still strictly a one-man show . he has lots of good
technical help, but he trusts no one else with politics . " even more
than russians, arabs express their folk wisdom in proverbs, ranging
from the cautionary (see cover) to the racially skeptical ( " better
the tyranny of the turks than the justice of the arabs " ) . there are
proverbs aplenty to fit the dream of unity . to the ambitious nasser,
other arab leaders might point out the one that says, " the camel
driver has his plans, and the camel has his . " but proverbs are
eclipsed by power, and last week nothing was more certain than that
whatever unity scheme emerges in the middle east, must, first of all,
be satisfactory to gamal abdel nasser . for of all the revolutions
involved, only his in egypt has survived and prospered for a full ten
years .

great britain what ever happened to christine keeler
? she was just another girl from middlesex who called herself a model
a euphemism as vague as " starlet " and with just as many implications
. but leggy, redheaded christine keeler, 21, managed to move in
mayfair's smartest circles and numbered among her wide range of
gentlemen acquaintances top names in london's political, social,
diplomatic and show business worlds . last week the social life of
christine keeler, onetime waitress and fulltime playgirl, was all over
the front pages of the british press . christine's sponsor was a social
gadabout named stephen ward, 43, an artist and osteopath who lives in a
thamesside summer house on viscount astor's famed estate at cliveden .
/ i know a lot of very important people and am often received in some
of the most famous homes in the country, " says ward . " sir winston
churchill and many leading politicians have been among my patients ;
prince philip, the duke and duchess of kent and lord snowdon have been
among my sitters . " ward also had a genuine interest in young girls of
humble origin . " i like pretty girls, " he says . " i am sensitive to
the needs and the stresses of modern living . " to the great and near
great, ward introduced " attractive young girls like christine keeler,
who come from the provinces or the remote suburbs " and for whom "
london is a battlefield . " chain of events . ward arranged an
unsuccessful screen test for christine with douglas fairbanks jr.,
introduced her to a naval attache at the russian embassy, and to a "
senior naval officer of the american fleet who sorted out her problems
. " but christine, said ward, also had " occasional foolhardy
adventures in the completely different world of colored men . " one day
last december, johnnie edgecombe, christine's west indian lover, showed
up outside ward's west end flat, where christine was visiting, and
fired several shots at the door . police carted johnnie away and tagged
christine to be a principal witness at his trial . then came a peculiar
chain of events . christine keeler failed to show up for johnnie's
trial, and the leading newspapers hinted that christine feared
cross-examination about her private life and had dropped out of sight
to protect her prominent friends . on top of that came news that ward's
cliveden house, the scene of many a fashionable party and fortuitous
introduction, had been ransacked ; ward's letters were stolen, and
scattered all over the floor were a nude photograph of christine and a
slew of pornographic pictures, which ward claimed were not his . in
whitehall and in the house of commons smoking rooms, rumors began
circulating that one of christine's many acquaintances was a government
minister .
cheek to cheek . at a late-night commons
session last week, a labor m.p . unexpectedly
asked the government " to deny
the truth of these rumors :. involving
a member of the government's front
bench . " another m.p . tried to make light
of the issue . " what do these rumors
amount to ? " he said . " they amount to
the fact that a minister has an acquaintance
with a very pretty girl . i should have
thought that that was a matter for congratulation
rather than enquiry . /
but left-wing laborite barbara castle
insisted on getting back to the question
of " miss christine keeler, missing call
girl, vanished witness . " what, she asked,
 " if there is something else of much greater
importance ? what if there is a question
of the perversion of justice at stake ? /
for the government's answer next
morning, the commons was packed . on
the front bench with prime minister harold
macmillan sat urbane tory secretary
of state for war john profumo, 48, whose
beautiful actress wife valerie (great
expectations) hobson sat quietly in the
speaker's gallery overhead . profumo rose
and calmly said, " i understand that my
name has been connected with the rumors
about the disappearance of miss keeler . /
indeed, profumo said, he and his wife
had met christine at cliveden, and he had
subsequently seen her " on about six occasions
at dr. ward's flat " in london . " i
last saw miss keeler in december 1961,
and i have not seen her since . any suggestion
that i was in any way connected
with or responsible for her absence from
the trial is wholly  and completely untrue .
there has been no impropriety between
myself and miss keeler . i shall not hesitate
to issue writs for libel and slander if
scandalous statements are made outside
this house . /
after the two-minute speech, profumo
and his wife left the commons for the
races at sandown park, where they were
the guests in the royal box of the queen
mother . that night the profumos danced

france 6,000 miles from home former premier michel debre is such
a listless political personality that a current joke says he was once
seen riding in an empty limousine . he has a fussy manner and a flat-
whining voice that somehow rub politicians and many other frenchmen the
wrong way, obscuring his considerable administrative talents . in
charles de gaulle's electoral landslide last november, debre the
dedicated gaullist, major architect of the fifth republic's
constitution, and the man who served a longer uninterrupted period as
premier (1,193 days) than any other in french parliamentary history was
ignominiously defeated in his own carefully cultivated rural
constituency by a local garage owner . de gaulle, who himself had used
debre as whipping boy for many of the regime's mistakes, soon found,
however, that he sorely missed debre's parliamentary skill . gaullist
aides began to ponder ways to get him back into the legislature, where,
if elected, he was likely to become majority leader . trouble was, no
gaullist faction in france itself wanted him . but at last a
constituency was found where debre seemed unlikely to lose week the
former premier gulped hard and accepted a bid to run for office on
reunion island, a tiny french dot in the indian ocean nearly 6,000

sweden caught in a drought when 40 years of liquor rationing
ended in 1955, most swedes laid in ample reserve stocks, vowing never
to be caught short again . but there they were, with cupboards bare
last week, amidst the direst shortage since the height of government
controls . trouble for the hard-drinking swedes began when foremen of
the state wine and liquor monopoly distilleries went out on strike four
weeks ago . the government declined their demands for longer vacations
. as a result, the distilleries closed up tight, and the country began
to dry up fast . last week wines, whiskies and liqueurs were all but
gone, and, even worse, the shops were running out of akvavit, sweden's
favorite drink . as alarmed swedes lined up at staterun package stores
to buy what they could, the government restricted akvavit sales to a
bottle per customer . and word went out that unless something is done
this week, fully a third of all sweden's liquor stores will be out of
akvavit altogether . bootleggers turned up furtively with the popular
brannvin akvavit, asking $20 for the bottle which normally sells for $5
. " a disaster, " muttered one swede, waiting his turn in a stockholm
queue . in the south, some desperate swedes were even hopping ferries

of former u.s . ambassador to iran selden chapin and a graduate in
oriental studies from sarah lawrence, hope met her widowed future
husband four years ago while she was vacationing at the indian resort
of darjeeling . but when the couple announced plans to marry last year,
sikkimese soothsayers forced the postponement of the wedding because of
their forecast that 1962 was " a black year " for the marriage . thus
hope had to wait until last week to become the first american girl to
wed royalty since the daughter of a former philadelphia bricklayer
married monaco's prince rainier in 1956 . hope's wedding dress was a
wraparound, frost-white brocade silk mokey, held in at the waist by a
gold belt, from which hung a small dagger . to ward off evil spirits,
hope pressed her hand into a piece of dough . a pair of holy men
conducted her to the chapel, where she was greeted by a fanfare of
trumpeting, 10ft.-long himalayan horns, braying conch shells, and
booming bass drums . outside the chapel door was the only distinctively
american touch in the $60,000 buddhist rite a mat on which was written
in english, " good luck . " billions of deities . during the 50minute
buddhist ceremony, hope sat on a throne slightly lower than that of the
crown prince, who in turn was seated lower than his father, the
69-year-old maharajah of sikkim . after drinking tea laced with yak
butter, a red-robed buddhist lama in a flame-shaped hat invoked the
blessings of the snow lions and billions of other sikkimese deities .
no wedding vows were spoken ; the couple merely exchanged 12-ft.-long
white silk scarves, which were hung around each other's neck to seal
their marriage contract . the end of the ceremony set off a fourday
celebration in gangtok, whose normal population of 12,000 swelled to
15,000 for the event . mountain tribesmen in blue pajamalike clothes
danced in the streets . mixing happily with the celebrators, hope
settled into her new role with aplomb . when a pigtailed sikkimese girl
asked for her autograph, the new crown princess signed without a
moment's hesitation : " hope namgyal .
hope is the daughter of mr . and mrs . john j . cooke

mother . when her mother died, she became the ward of her maternal
grandparents, mr . and mrs . winchester noyes . when they died, she
became the ward of her uncle, ambassador chapin .

bali the gods speak when java was lost to the mohammedans 485
years ago, so the legend goes, the disgusted hindu gods hunted around
for a new home . they chose the island of bali, and since their exalted
rank demanded a high dwelling place, they created a chin of mountainse
most sacred eastern end of the island, the gods erected the highest of
bali's mountains, the 10,308foot volcano of gunung agung, regarded by
the balinese as " the navel of the world . " halfway up the slope of
agung, the pious balinese built the huge mother temple of besakih, and
every hundred years they have held a solemn rite there to rid the
island of ghosts . last week, in the midst of the once-a-century
festival, agung erupted with catastrophic fury . agung gave fair
warning . only last month, after more than 100 years of inactivity, it
burst forth with a shower of smoke and brimstone that killed 17 persons
. there was worried talk on bali that the gods were angry because the
people had not asked permission to hold their festival . but the
priests and their disciples stayed on to pray . at 7 o'clock one
morning, agung erupted again . the villages of sebudi, sorgah, and
sebih were engulfed by a lethal black cloud of searing, 230o ash that
roasted hundreds where they knelt . rivers of grey-black lava boiled
over agun's southern lip and flowed in fiery rivulets down stream beds,
raising clouds of steam ; heavy rains, possibly caused by the heat of
the volcano, mixed with the sulphurous ash to form an acid that killed
plant life for five miles around . for five days agung belched death .
at week's end hhe death toll stood at close to 1,200, and another
200,000 were left homeless . as survivors streamed into towns at the
base of the mountain, many suffering third-degree burns from a trek
over beds of smoldering ashes, indonesia's president sukarno declared
all bali a disaster area . there was little hope that agung's fury was
over . experts in djakarta predicted even more violent eruptions to
come and ordered all residents to leave the area for at least two
months .

south korea squeeze in seoul in south korea last week, a farmer
named song kyu il traveled all the way from the southern provinces to
parade before seoul's duk soo palace with a placard scrawled in his own
blood : general park, please do something to settle the crisis .
farmer song was thrown in jail, along with some 200 other demonstrators
who openly protested south korean strongman general park chung hee's
broken promise to call general elections in may and hand over power to
the civilians . the wholesale arrests only served to attract more
attention to the noisy campaign of former president yun po sun, 65, and
new rule party leader huh chung, 67, who touched off the uproar with a
series of antigovernment meetings . junta leaders were reluctant to
arrest yun and huh for fear they would become political martyrs . but
the men around park did not hesitate to reject the opposition demands .
defense minister kim sung un summoned 160 top military men to seoul for
a strategy meeting, later took to a nationwide radio hookup to speak
for them : " we strongly support the present government . there are
seeds of uneasiness in the country, and this is not the time to
transfer the government to civilians . " then, to make the point more
emphatically, all 160 officers rode grandly through the streets of
seoul in a convoy of military jeeps . it was general park himself who
felt the squeeze, for he was less interested than the rest of his junta
in retaining power in the hands of the army . but he could not bow to
the clamoring civilians, or even to the pressure applied from
washington by u.s . ambassador samuel berger last week . for if he
reversed himself yet another time to support the civilians, a military

a tough row to hoe when he was named communist party boss in the
problem-plagued virgin lands of kazahkstan (time, jan . 4) . but he
could hardly have guessed the extent of the mess he would inherit from
his purged predecessor . last week yusupov published a report charging
that more than $600 million had been wasted during the last three years
on illconceived projects ; no fewer than 16,139 regional officials
were fired last year alone, 2,340 of them for stealing and embezzling
$1,270,000 . a gang of crooks led by the chief of the tselinograd trade
board faked reports, rigged phony prices, and sold meat, butter and
automobiles on the black market ; in pavlodar, three men managed to
make off with no fewer than 300,000 bottles of wine and vodka . the
entire party and government leadership of the kzyl orda region
masterminded a ring of cattle rustlers ; the local communist chief
organized blackjack games and set off an " epidemic of gambling . "
since yusupov's own head was now on the block, there was almost a
plaintive note in his concluding question : " can one be expected to
achieve good farming results under such conditions ? " he had a ready

the curator of the west european art history section of leningrad's
famed hermitage museum rose to defend " formalistic distortions and
asserted that " this is buoyant, creative art . " ' what's more, the

soviet union was poet evgeny evtushenko, usually the most outspoken of

great britain the angry ones hey nonny no ! trilled the tory
daily mail one morning last week . after the bitterest winter in 50
years, daffodils were blooming in london's parks, and government
officials reported with relief that the unemployment rate had dropped,
from 3.9 per cent to 3.1 per cent , for the first time in more than
six months . their jubilation was short-lived . in a rite of spring
such as britain has not witnessed since the depression, more than 5,000
jobless workers converged on london to protest their plight, touching
off an ugly, rock-throwing battle at the very door of parliament .
raising the flag . it all began peacefully enough with a banner-waving
parade toward westminster, where workers' leaders were determined to
carry personal protests to their m.p.s . awkwardly at first, many
fingering the cloth caps that are the traditional badge of the british
workingman, they stood talking until the house of commons' big central
lobby was jammed, while a surging mob of workers still outside jostled
impatiently to get through st . stephen's doorway . when 500 hastily
summoned foot and mounted police tried to force them back, the protest
demonstration exploded into a savage, three-hour melee provoked partly
by communists in the crowd . crying " fascists " and " gestapo, " the
workers dropped lighted cigarettes into police horses' mouths, tried to
drag the cops from their mounts, hurled horse manure at them . some
young workers climbed onto the stone figures around the entrance, and
one communist agitator even hauled up a red flag . when a police cordon
forced them away from the buildings after six charges, hundreds of
demonstrators staged a sitdown strike in the road . the crowd included
kilted scotsmen and old-age pensioners, apprentices, mill girls and
grizzled steelworkers . most came from the northern shipbuilding and
steelmaking cities of england, scotland and northern ireland, where the
misery of the 1930s is not forgotten . last week, by contrast with the
hunger marches of that era, most arrived by train or bus ; some even
came by plane . said a scottish miner : " we are not hungry men asking
for food . we are angry men asking for self-respect . " getting into
politics . they pointed out that though warm weather has boosted
employment in homebuilding and heavy construction, the actual total of
unemployed (702,000) in britain was still 250,000 higher than in the
previous march, and was actually rising in the worst-hit northern areas
. another rally next day by some 5,000 teachers demanding a wage raise
showed that disenchantment with harold macmillan's conservative
government is even more widespread . it was far too early to predict
the impact of all this on the coming elections, which will probably
take place next year . but macmillan hardly welcomed the demonstrations
on top of all the other recent bad news : three by-election reverses
in a fortnight, and a new gallup poll report on voter preference
showing that the labor party holds a record 16.5 per cent lead over the

france finis for s.a.o . ? as swissair flight 227 to zurich
taxied onto the runway at munich last week, it was followed closely by
a black police limousine . not until the red-and-silver convair
disappeared into the night did the plainclothesman inside the car
return to headquarters to report that georges bidault, 63, former
premier of france and now self-styled operational chief of the
terrorist secret army organization, had left west germany . for the
first time since bidault was traced to his hideaway in a rural villa
last month, bavaria's minister of interior heinrich junker breathed
easily . sighed he : " a heavy cross is off my back . " bidault did
not leave munich without a vow to " continue my fight against de gaulle
until freedom has been restored in my country . " landing in portugal
under an assumed name, he was given even less chance to plot against de
gaulle's life than he enjoyed in easygoing bavaria ; almost as soon as
he turned up at a lisbon rooming house, security cops hauled him off to
a suburban lisbon villa . he was expected to seek refuge in south
america . drifting aimlessly like a man without a country, bidault
today is a pathetic fugitive who drinks too much and talks too much to
be an effective opponent of the regime . and french officials insist
that the s.a.o . movement, whose murderous followers once struck terror
into the hearts of frenchmen, has fallen apart since france's truce
with algeria in march 1962 . plagued by apathy and hounded by the
61,000-man police force of interior minister roger frey, the s.a.o . is
no longer able to maintain commando units in each of france's nine
military districts, as it once did . today, top officials claim, there

neighboring countries (500 in spain alone), they too are now almost all

the allies temptation of trade pipe the big kind that russia
desperately needs to complete its vast gas and oil network stretching
from the pacific to the elbe was the second biggest topic in european
capitals last week . for months, nato has been urging a total embargo
on large-diameter pipe . sputtered a nato official in paris : " sell
them rifles . even sell them atomic bombs . but don't sell them pipe .
/ provoking the outcry was a rumble that started in bonn fortnight ago
when rebellious members of the bundestag rounded up enough votes to
reverse the governmen't cancellation of a juicy $20 million soviet pipe
order . chancellor konrad adenauer rushed back home from a lake como
vacation on the eve of the balloting, managed to avoid humiliating
defeat only by ordering his christian democrats to stay off the floor,
thus causing the lack of a quorum . der alte's last-ditch maneuver
proved his solid support of the u.s., which, unlike most of its allies,
attaches great strategic significance to moscow's pipeline network .
but it got adenauer into trouble at home . the pro-nato socialists
called the bundestag boycott dirty pool ; the industrialists
complained more bitterly than ever . there the issue could have
simmered indefinitely ; but last week the british calmly announced
that, since they had never supported nato's pipe embargo in the first
place, the government had no objection if a british firm accepted a
soviet deal for pipe that bonn had just canceled . that only one
british company was technically equipped to turn out small amounts of
large-diameter pipe and had not even received a bid from moscow was of
small comfort to u.s . and west german officials . nor were they
reassured by the fact that italy, a major supplier of soviet pipe
before the nato ban, did not immediately grab off part of the lucrative
trade ; italian manufacturers simply were backed up at the moment with
their own domestic orders . what really had washington and bonn
concerned was london's next move . britain, excluded for now from the
common market and plagued by serious unemployment, was eager for export
markets anywhere ; if one inch of large-diameter oil pipe was
delivered to russia, the nato boycott would be broken . west germany
and italy could no longer be restrained . neither could france, which
has a massive (500,000 tons), and mostly unused, annual capacity for
pipe production, but which supports the u.s . completely on the allies'
debate over the strategic value of moscow's big inch .

austria two on the seesaw ever since world war ii even through ten
years of soviet occupation the austrian government has been run jointly
by the conservative people's party and the socialist party, like two
polite, equally weighted cousins on an inert seesaw . so scrupulously
balanced is the coalition and the proporz system of dividing up the
jobs that, according to viennese table talk, if there is one people's
party putzfrau (charwoman) in a government building, there must be a
socialist putzfrau too . after last november's elections, balance
became stalemate ; the two big parties have been haggling over a
cabinet ever since . a group of vociferous people's party reformers
argued for less of the traditional cooperation with the socialists, but
the meager victory of the people's party 81 seats to 76 for the
socialists was hardly a mandate for sweeping change . still,
conservative chancellor alfons gorbach shared the reformers' feeling
that the extra strength entitled his party to at least one more
ministry . the one in mind : the foreign ministry, where socialist
bruno kreisky was the prime target of the people's party reformers .
the conservatives argued that a socialist could not possibly put his
heart into the vital negotiations for austrian associate membership in
the common market, which, after all, was a triumph of capitalism . for
more than four months, the socialists and people's party negotiators
met almost daily in the ornate ballhaus palace to argue about the
cabinet, and all the while austria hummed along happily under a
provisional government that was precisely in the middle of the road .
last week the bickering ended at last with the people's party on the
short end . the able, personable kreisky stayed on as foreign minister,
and this victory for the socialists was countered only by the addition
of a few people's party state secretaries to the trade and justice
ministries . another socialist, former trade union boss franz olah,
took over the interior ministry, where he is in control of the
country's police power . olah is an able man, but for many austrians
his appointment means trouble . on his second day in office, he told a
press conference that he felt it perfectly proper for his cops to

multi-bafflement the u.s .
today is engaged in not one, but two nuclear arms races . its first and
overriding concern, of course, is to deter soviet aggression and to be
capable of massive retaliation if the russians should attack the west .
washington's second aim, however, is less strategic than political ;
it could be called the theory of the massive placebo, since its primary
purpose is not to deter the foes of the u.s . but to mollify its
friends and discourage the proliferation of nuclear arms . by last
week, u.s . placebo planners had succeeded only in frustrating and
perplexing the very allies they hoped to please . uneasily aware that
the increasingly prosperous and powerful nations of western europe
would not forever accept total u.s . control of nuclear weapons, the
u.s . offered more than two years ago to give them a voice in their
disposition and use but left it to europe to devise a formula . it was
not until the kennedy administration canceled the bug-ridden skybolt
missile project last december that the u.s . was forced to take the
initiative . in place of skybolt, the administration reluctantly
offered at nassau to supply polaris missiles for an independent british
submarine force . change of mind . at the same time, the u.s . insisted
that the british subs must be " multinational, " that is, they were to
be part of a nato deterrent in which other allies might in time pool
their own strike forces, if and when they acquired nuclear weapons . to
placate its other european allies, the kennedy administration also
proposed a " multilateral " force of polaris submarines, which would be
multimanned and multifinanced by the u.s . and its partners, each of
whom would have a veto over the use of the missiles . then, just as the
europeans began to get interested in this scheme, the u.s . abruptly
changed its mind and announced that the multilateral force (mlf) should
consist of polaris-armed surface vessels instead though it would be
little strategic value, a 25-ship surface force would cost only $500
million yearly, far less than a submarine fleet . to most europeans,
the strongest argument for the mlf was that it would give west germany
a voice in nuclear strategy and possibly discourage it from developing
nuclear weapons of its own, with or without help from france frankly
interested . to peddle the placebo, the administration plucked old
state department hand livingston merchant from retirement . to his
surprise, mlf met with a surprisingly warm reception . though some
allied statesmen hemmed that its cost would prevent them from meeting
u.s . requests to strengthen conventional forces, west germany, italy
and belgium were frankly interested . last month merchant actually
succeeded in extracting a commitment from west germany to pay 40 per
cent of the entire cost of the project . however, last week, word
reached nato headquarters in paris that washington had suddenly lost
its enthusiasm for the multilateral force . its change of mind not only
left unsolved the political problems that mlf was devised to solve, but
even seemed likely to aggravate them, since the u.s . was now
reportedly ready to back the idea of independent multinational forces
instead, thus encouraging its allies to build their own bombs . even if
every nato ally could afford its own nuclear force and a scientific
breakthrough may yet make that feasible europe would have only a minute
proportion of the total u.s . nuclear armory . but who can predict how
it will turn out ? in the brave new world of build-your-own-bang, it
could even happen that european hydrogen bombs might not fall on the
soviet union at all, but on the u.s .

needs to ensure military supremacy in the middle east . from 333's
workrooms last year came the first batch of missiles, a few 230-mile
el-zafir (victory) types, and the 370-mile elkahir (conqueror) .
although their reliability is none too certain, the military leaders of
nearby israel have nervously noted nasser's claims that egypt's birds
will have the range to blast important targets " just south of beirut "
that is, in israel itself . mysterious misfortunes . hence israel's
extraordinary interest in the key men who staff factory 333 . they are
not egyptians at all, but an estimated 200 german scientists and
technicians, many of whom first learned their skills making v-2s for
adolf hitler . ever since the germans helped nasser test-fire his first
successful rockets last july, israeli intelligence chiefs have been
conducting a deadly underground war to force or frighten the german
scientists away from the project . last month two israeli agents were
arrested in switzerland after they allegedly put pressure on the son
and daughter of dr . paul-jens goercke, a west german
electronic-guidance expert employed at military factory 333 . as swiss
police told it, the agents persuaded heidi goercke, 25, and her brother
hans, 21, to cross the frontier from freiburg, germany, and warned them
that they must talk their father into coming home from egypt or else he
would face " serious " trouble . eavesdropping on the conversation,
forewarned swiss detectives tossed the israeli operatives into jail,
charged them with coercion and operating illegally on behalf of a
foreign state . the incident recalled a whole chain of mysterious
misfortunes that have befallen germans linked to egypt . last summer
the private plane of an egyptian supplying arms and technicians blew up
over northern germany, killing his wife ; in november two airmail
parcels addressed to german rocket engineer wolfgang pilz blew up when
opened in his office in egypt, killing five egyptians and disfiguring
pilz's german secretary . then, on a road near the west german town of
lorrach, a would-be assassin fired a pistol shot a a professor engaged
in electronics research for egypt ; the bullet missed and the would-be
assassin escaped in a car . biggest unsolved riddle is the whereabouts
of dr . heinz krug, 49, boss of a munich firm that dealt in military
hardware for egypt . last november, krug vanished from his office in
the company of a polite stranger and has not been seen since .
backtrack in bonn . to charges that israel is behind the incidents,
israeli authorities insist that their agents employ only peaceful
persuasion . israel's foreign minister golda meir rose in the knesset
(parliament) fortnight ago to brand germans in egypt an " evil crew . "
she demanded that west germany order them to halt their work . bonn
retorted that the germans in egypt were private citizens with no
official connections whatsoever ; the government could hardly dictate
their professions . but anxious to stay on good terms with the
israelis, chancellor konrad adenauer last week agreed to reconsider the
matter, ordered formation of a committee to decide whether some kind of
controls such as removal of passports should be imposed on german
citizens whose work abroad endangered the nation's good relations with

onto the bandwagon gamal abdel nasser still had the most popular
commodity in the middle east the lure of arab unity . a 14-man algerian
delegation, headed by defense minister houari boumedienne showed up in
cairo to pay its respects . " regarding arab unity, " said boumedienne,
/ our objective should be the creation of solid, strong and healthy
bases . the arab people are not ready to accept another setback,
another letdown . for that reason, all steps toward arab unity must be
absolutely unshakeable . " nasser agreed completely . " we refuse, if
anybody asks us, " he said, " to form a nominal union for outward
appearances . " later, he fervently told a syrian delegation headed by
baath party leaders michel aflak and salah el-bitar : " we believe the
tide of revolutionary union in this generation is a historic
opportunity which will not repeat itself . " he also suggested that the
baathists broaden their new syrian government to bring in popular that
is, nasserite elements . " man of crises . " he got fast results .
within three days, pro-nasser lieut . general louai attassi was named
president of the syrian council of the revolutionary command, and the
council itself was enlarged to admit a nasserite majority . attassi
predicted that union with egypt and iraq would be achieved " shortly, "
claiming, " this tripartite federation will spread and spread until the
entire arab world from the atlantic ocean to the persian gulf is
unified in one powerful state, weighing heavily in the balance of world
power . " even one of nasser's enemies in the arab world the hashemite
kingdom of jordan showed signs last week of being discreetly available
. in his stone basman palace in amman, guarded by circassian troopers
in astrakhan hats, jordan's king hussein deftly shifted prime ministers
. out went muscular wasfi tal, 43, an efficient but nasser-hating
administrator . in came jordan's " man of crises, " five-time prime
minister samir rifai, 62, who has been campaigning in recent months for
more democracy inside jordan and an end to antagonism against nasser .
what's the difference ? after a late night talk, king hussein and
rifai agreed on a new government, looking toward parliamentary
democracy and hussein's eventual retirement to the figurehead role of a
constitutional monarch . they even gingerly accepted the nasser-baath
slogan of " freedom, unity, socialism, " with only the slight amendment
of the final word to read " a better life . " what was still uncertain
last week was whether nasser is prepared to drop or modify his present
determination to unite only with " liberated " arab states and to shun
monarchies . said new jordanian prime minister rifai : " we have our
pride . we are just as healthy and strong as any arab state . we don't
intend to rush into anything, but we do intend to proclaim our good
will and our attachment to arab unity . " then he added hopefully, "
there's every reason for the new arab union to welcome jordan and no
reason to bar a constitutional monarchy . we have more freedom than
many republics . what's the difference anyway between a constitutional
president and a constitutional king ? /

morocco a friend in washington in washington's union station last
week, the pennsylvania railroad's ancient private car no . 1750 came to
a hesitant stop . clearly uncertain of the engineer's intentions, king
hassan ii of morocco descended cautiously to the platform, then
displayed a big, engaging smile as he shook hands with president
kennedy, and turned with even more warmth to jackie kennedy, smartly
clad in a spring dress and coat, and dark blue straw hat . lovely rival
. king hassan even produced a rival for jackie in his lovely sister,
princess lalla nezha, 22, who was greeted with a bouquet of red roses .
all the proper protocol was laid on, from a 50-yd . red carpet to an
honor guard . " we are proud to welcome you, your majesty, " said the
president to the king . " your country was the first to recognize the
u.s . in the most difficult days of our revolution . "  king hassan
responded by saying that he had come to the u.s . " to renew my
acquaintance with your people, to meet you and your government . "
thirty-three-year-old king hassan also brought with him crates of gifts
; but left behind in rabat was a small, shiny grey horse with the
moroccan colors of red and green plaited in its mane, which had been
intended for caroline . the state department was courteously adamant :
no more horses for the white house . king hassan chose the u.s . for
his first state visit outside africa to demonstrate that morocco,
though officially unaligned, knows that its real interest lies with the
west . indeed, in the two years since his father died, hassan has
proved to be a sensible leader of morocco's 11.6 million people . three
lovely days . between banquets and receptions, the king and the
president got to know and like each other . hassan even canceled a
scheduled visit to the naval academy at annapolis in order to have
additional talks with kennedy . their conversation ranged over many
world problems, from middle east tensions to cuba, to nato . there was
also quiet affirmation of decisions already taken, including the u.s .
pledge to evacuate three big sac airfields and a naval base in morocco
by year's end, and to continue an unspecified amount of financial aid
to hassan's kingdom (last year's total : $30 million) . king hassan
was impressed by his hospitable reception, which included special
entertainment at the white house (scenes from brigadoon), an unusual
welcome from 100,000 washingtonians lining the streets, and three of
the loveliest spring days in washington memory . the state department
liked the ingelligence and competence displayed by king hassan
throughout the sessions, his serious preoccupation with his own region
of north africa, his judicious comment that morocco would join an arab
union headed by egypt's nasser only after careful study had shown such
union to be " in the common good . " the washington consensus : king
hassan is a " modern reformist " in the tradition of the shah of iran .
as early as spring
1776, france was secretly aiding the infant u.s . against britain with
money and munitions . early in 1778, the sultan of morocco impetuously
decided to recognize the u.s . government and, because of
communications difficulty, tried to do so through a french emissary .
france slipped in ahead, recognizing the u.s . on feb . 6, 1778, v .
feb . 20 for morocco, which, because of prior intent, still likes to
think it holds first place .

turkey how to stay in trouble when turkey's premier ismet
inonu finally let his old enemy ex-president celal bayar out of jail
for medical treatment fortnight ago, he figured the least he should get
was a little gratitude from the opposition justice party . instead,
bayary supporters turned the occasion into a week-long political
demonstration against the government . five hundred autos filled with
justice party followers formed a traffic-snarling motorcade to escort
the 79-year-old bayar from prison to his ankara home . next day, huge
crowds milled around the house, and 10,000 supporters massed near
parliament to shout his slogans . two sympathetic turkish air force
pilots happily buzzed the city in their jets . growing angry and a bit
nervous over the popular demonstration, the army officers who run
turkey from behind the scenes locked up one batch of exultant bayar men
who stopped their bus in front of the ministry of defense and " made
signs against the army, " then issued an announcement warning that the
/ events threaten national unity . " at this signal, pro-government
demonstrators themselves took to the streets yelling " bayar, back to
your cave, " and ransacked justice party headquarters . in istanbul,
cops tried to prevent a bloody clash by opening both pontoon bridges
across the golden horn, thus separating pro- and antibayar groups .
bayar himself was doing nothing to calm things ,; he publicly attacked
the court at yassiada that sentenced him to prison 18 months ago ;
tearfully, he embraced the son of the late premier adnan menderes,
bayar's colleague who was sent to the gallows by the yassiada tribunal
. throughout it all, premier inonu performed a classic slow burn,
letting the justice crowd have its fun for six days . at last, the
exasperated authorities could take no more, sent bayar off to a
hospital . just a physical examination, the cops assured the old man,
who promptly went on a hunger strike . a guard was put on the door of
his hospital room, and the news soon spread that bayar's parole had
been revoked . the end of the trail might well be the jailhouse again,
for at week's end the public prosecutor began proceedings against him
for talking down the regime in public .

the congo caesars of the bush an elderly shopkeeper in
elisabethville ignored or perhaps did not hear a congolese soldier's
order to get off the sidewalk in front of the heavily guarded national
bank of katanga last week . angrily, the soldier hoisted his rifle and
shot him in the back . as the man lay groaning on the pavement,
congolese troops shoved away a doctor who tried to save his life . the
cold-blooded killing pointed up the grim fact that nearly three months
after united nations troops crushed secessionist moise tshombe's regime
and placed the province under premier cyrille adoula's central
government, peace is far from restored in katanga . each guard post
that the u.n . hands over to the central regime's armee nationale
congolaise seems to produce a little area of anarchy . in recent weeks,
trigger-happy a.n.c . soldiers in elisabethville have killed at least
one katangese civilian per day . barefoot police . things are almost as
chaotic in the congo's other 17 provinces, where local bush caesars go
their own anarchic ways unimpeded by central authority . in coffee-rich
north kivu, provincial president benezeth moley maintains headquarters
in one room of a general store, runs things with a 300-man police force
recruited from local tribesmen . in maniema province, cold-eyed
president hilarie kisanga enforces discipline with 1,200 barefoot cops
who lounge in the streets armed with lead pipes, and who live off
on-the-spot fines imposed on passers-by . protests a shopowner : " you
walk on the right side of the street and you are fined . you walk on
the left side and you are fined . " the average congolese has little
legal redress . today, in a nation three times the size of texas, there
are only 47 judges to hear complaints all foreigners, imported by the
u.n . from such countries as egypt, sweden, spain and switzerland .
this is just one of the many problems of leopoldville's premier adoula
. lacking funds and trained personnel, he has virtually no control over
his sprawling nation of 17 million largely illiterate people . the
congo's administrative structure has been ripped apart by two years of
civil war, and the chief aim of the national parliament sometimes seems
to be destruction of any central authority . for many weeks, adoula's
government has been on the razor's edge of defeat at the hands of
leopoldville's chaotic legislature, whose debates sometimes verge on
the insane . fortnight ago, for example, as the ragtag chamber of
deputies discussed the congo's proposed new motto " unity, justice,
progress " one speaker opined : " progress' is no good . one can
progress backward as well as forward . " retorted a fellow deputy : "
that goes for " work' too . there is such a thing as bad work . " then
silence fell over the chamber as the president of the body rose to
announce that he had made a startling discovery that changed everything
. " we have just learned, " he intoned, " that this motto is already in
use by west germany . " amid the uproar that followed, deputies were
heard to cry, " who is responsible, who ? "  finally, a portly
deputy named emile zola mounted the dais to plead : " so much the
better . now we will have a twin country in the world . we are
underdeveloped ; germany is overdeveloped ; our brotherhood can only
lead to a good result . " with these shrill cries ringing in their
ears, united nations officials went nervously ahead with plans to pull
out nearly half of the u.n . congo force's peak strength of 19,000
troops by summer's end . the congolese would have to mature some day ;
they might as well begin now .

embassy official in the corridor who kept insisting, " no, no, it's all

nyasaland sir edgar & the elders one day in march 1959, in the
british central africa protectorate of nyasaland, harmless-looking
elard chipandale, 31, tied a handful of magic twigs about his waist,
donned a coat of tree bark, and turned himself into a crocodile . he
lay in wait by the bank of the mwanza river for an eight-year-old girl
named mponda simenti . when mponda ambled by on the way to fetch water
for her family, elard the crocodile dragged her into the river, broke
her arm with his lashing tail, and finished her off with his
finger-long teeth . this was elard's own mystical version of what some
might consider merely a case of murder for pay . the girl's
grandfather, odreck kasoci, had sought out elard to get rid of the
annoying child because elard was well known in the neighborhood as a "
magic man, " and therefore qualified to deal with the problem . odreck
agreed to pay $13.50 for the assassination, but when the deed was done,
he reneged . chipandale sued in a native court for his fee and won .
but a government policeman happened in on the proceedings and reported
the two men . last week, in nyasaland's commercial center of blantyre
both men were on trial for murder . elard's ready admission of the
killing did not make things any easier for chief justice sir edgar
unsworth . for elard insisted that he was not guily because he was a
crocodile at the time . sir edgar called in the government's
psychiatrist to test elard's sanity . he was judged not insane, but the
psychiatrist added, " we must admit we are dealing with a mentality
completely foreign to us . " sir edgar turned to the court assessors
three tribal elders for expert guidance . " are you satisfied, " he
asked, " that the prosecution has established that elard was not, on
account of his superstitious belief, under the delusion that he was a
crocodile ? " the three were unanimous in their answer : " he turned
himself into a magic crocodile and seized the child . " sir edgar was
faced with another classic clash of white man's rules with deeprooted
african beliefs . since the two could not be resolved, sir edgar was
forced to make his decision on the basis of social patterns he could
understand . ignoring the elders' testimony, he sentenced both men to
be hanged .

central africa the crumbling federation as long ago as last
december, it was obvious that the shaky central african federation was
not long for this world . obvious, that is, to everyone but the
federation's prime minister, big- beefy sir roy welensky, who stoutly
insisted that continued presence of the white man in africa " depended
on the maintenance of the union of northern and southern rhodesia .
room sulkers . looking his most bulldoggish, and giving a jaunty
thumbs-up salute, welensky stormed into london last week, prophesying
ruin and anarchy if his warnings were ignored . asked if he would use
federal troops to prevent the secession of black-dominated northern
rhodesia, sir roy replied, " the only time one would use force would be
to maintain law and order . one would not stand by and see things smash
. but if you are asking me whether i would use force to keep the two
rhodesias together, the answer is no, because it would not work . " by
the time welensky checked into the hyde park hotel, nationalist kenneth
kaunda, top african leader in northern rhodesia, had already attended
his first meeting with britain's deputy prime minister r . a . butler
to decide the future course of central africa . of rambunctious sir
roy, kaunda sneered, " we are here to rob him of his job . you might
make him lord broken reed . " with rab butler, kaunda and his fellow
nationalist, harry nkumbula, argued for two hours northern rhodesia's
right to secede, and asked why their country should be considered " the
cinderella of central africa . " when butler refused to make any
promises, the two african leaders walked out and sulked for two days in
their hotel rooms . power seekers . this apparently was enough for rab
butler . he called in welensky and southern rhodesia's prime minister
winston field, a lean, enigmatic farmer who is less interested in the
fate of the federation than in seeing to it that southern rhodesia's
221,000 whites retain political control of the state's 3,600,000 blacks
. butler announced britain's decision : no territory would be kept in
the federation against its will . furious at this " act of betrayal, "
welensky stalked angrily from butler's office and promptly canceled a
luncheon engagement with prime minister macmillan, a snub without
precedent in british commonwealth annals . at a news conference, he
stormed that " these decisions have been taken by her majesty's
government under threat from men who seek power . the people of central
africa, black and white alike, are being betrayed to these men ! "
southern rhodesia's field took the news in stride . now that the
federation was virtually dissolved, field wanted a british guarantee of
independence for southern rhodesia, and presumably a guarantee of its
constitution, which is rigged against the black majority . until such
guarantees are given, said field, he will attend no more conferences .

a certain credibility to every rumor about the kremlin, especially when
it concerns the supposed ups and downs of nikita khrushchev. thus it
was last week that a whisper from moscow via rome became a blast of hot
air felt around the world . it all began with a moscow dispatch by
giuseppe boffa, correspondent for italy's communist newspaper l'unita,
which soberly described soviet troubles in domestic and foreign affairs
and at one point permitted itself the flat assertion that " moscow is
living through a delicate and interesting political moment . " rome's
volatile press erupted with screaming headlines predicting nikita's
imminent downfall . big papers in new york,london and paris gave way to
similar speculation . though khrushchev was surely under pressure, he
did not act like a fellow on the skids . he sent a note to his poison
pen pal mao tse-tung politely declining mao's invitation to talk over
the sino-soviet split in peking (time, march 22). instead he invited
mao or a group of colleagues to moscow . suggested time for the
confrontation of quarreling communists : in the spring or summer, "
which are good seasons of the year in our country . /
even the ups and downs of soviet space technology
were shrouded in uncertainty last week . moscow launched a fourth moon
probe, but with typical secrecy did not reveal its mission . the size
of lunik iv (1f tons) led some western scientists to believe it was
designed to carry out a soft landing on the moon . but after 3f days in
flight, lunik iv missed the moon by 5,281 miles . was lunik iv a flop

russia that strange time i am not retreating one damned step .
it is good to be angry at untruth . so, in the full flush of
destalinization, wrote evgeny evtushenko, 29, the russian poet whose
honest rage at the cant and callousness of soviet society has made him
the idol of his generation . for a while, in fact, it seemed as if
evtushenko (time cover, april 13, 1962) had become a semiofficial angry
young marxist, whose occasional excesses were tolerated by the regime
because they made it appear as if khrushchev's communism could actually
accept criticism . if so, evtushenko pushed his luck too far . vain
apologies . during a swing through france and west germany early this
year, the dashing young poet was lionized at parties (including a
masquerade ball during munich's annual carnival) by pleasure-loving
bourgeois intellectuals . he even held a series of freewheeling press
conferences . heaping scorn on the party fossils whose hackwork wins
the stalin prize each year, evtushenko actually blamed stalin's reign
of terror on the dictator's " close associates " of whom, though he did
not say so, nikita khrushchev is the dean emeritus . the poet's most
audacious gesture of independence was to give the editors of france's
l'express his autobiography for publication, knowing well that no
soviet writer is permitted to publish abroad without first getting
clearance from the censors . cued by khrushchev himself, who recently
rapped evtushenko for " cheap sensationalism, " a three-day meeting of
the union of soviet writers last month addressed itself almost
exclusively to destroying the cult of evtushenko . in all, close to 40
tame authors trooped monotonously forward to denounce evtushenko and
other liberal young writers for offenses ranging from bad rhymes to "
sacrilgeious statements " about the revolution . though evtushenko made
abject apologies for his " irrevocable mistake, " the drumfire of
criticism only grew louder and more insistent . mutter in minsk . last
week the soviet press fumed that evtushenko and other young writers
should not be allowed to travel abroad until they " mature politically
. " when a west german girl was detained at the soviet border on
charges of smuggling caviar, izvestia brought evtushenko into it by
charging that she had met evtushenko in germany and from him had
learned all about " fashionable moscow youth . " in minsk, where dmitry
shostakovich's new 13th symphony was performed for the first time
outside moscow, a critic castigated the composer for basing part of his
score on evtushenko's famed poem, babi yar, a savage indictment of
soviet anti-semitism that the literary commissars have already made
evtushenko revise . though khrushchev was plainly out to make
evtushenko the scapegoat, the campaign against the poet was only part
of a new, systematic attempt to clamp strict party controls on the
theater, music, art, book publishing, industrial design, and every
other field in which young communists might be tempted to voice
independent thoughts . it was once more that " strange time, " as
evtushenko wrote in 1960, " when common integrity could be called
courage . /

those who have earnings on the side . there is a custom in the village

town . " everyone would rather work for himself and earn more than work
for the collective, he laments . " it's the same old story . a real
vicious circle . in order to be paid well, people should work full

his fate . at the end of his rounds mysovsky is dog-tired and
depressed, stops off at the recreation hall for a drink, and promptly

harvest instead of the regulation 10 per cent , and lo and behold, with
that incentive, they are out in the fields early next day . next
morning, mysovsky wakes up with a hangover, rubs his eyes at the sight
of workers' kerchiefs bobbing like daisies in the fields . then he
remembers . . . " thirty percent ? how could he have said anything of
the sort ? his head might fall for that . he could imagine the cries
of the party bosses : " you have unleashed property-possessing ideas .
you let yourself be led by backward elements.' just the same, thought
the chairman, the workers were out in the fields just because of the
promise of 30 per cent without shouting, demands or discussion . "
mysovsky hastily walked toward the home of the local party boss to
explain things before they put him on trial . the closer he got to the
house, the more frightened he became . on the way, an assistant stopped
him, asked whether he wanted to send additional workers to outlying

great britain weekend in washington from the solicitous reception
he got from the new frontier, the little coldeyed man who stepped off
the airliner in washington might have been britain's prime minister
rather than the opposition leader . even in his own labor party six
months ago, pipe-puffing harold wilson was regarded as a slippery
opportunist and a constant threat to the party's hardwon unity under
the late hugh gaitskell . though his views on most major issues were
calculatedly murky, " little harold, " as his foes call him, drew
left-wing support by condemning u.s . handling of cuba, cheering on the
unilateralists, bitterly opposing britain's bid for common market
membership . however, it was not wilson's past that brought out
washington's red carpet but his potential future . even though
elections will probably not be called for at least a year, no u.s .
policymaker could ignore today's gallup polls, which give the labor
party a record 50 per cent to 33f per cent lead over the tories . if
that trend should continue, harold wilson would be britain's next prime
minister . what administration officials got last week was ample
demonstration of the fact that since gaitskell's death, the flinty,
quick-witted
yorkshireman has had to
move closer to the political center to hold the party together and take
hard and fast stands on which britain's electorate can weigh the merits
of a labor government . wilson was plainly anxious to win the new
frontier's confidence . after an intensive, four-day round of
conferences with president kennedy and key administrative hands, the
labor leader's views on most outstanding world issues seemed now at
least as close to u.s . policy as harold macmillan's . " denegotiation
. " wilson's most reassuring message was that he unequivocally supports
nato as " the center of our defense policy in europe . " to the delight
of the defense department, which has long tried in vain to persuade
britain to build up its chronically inadequate ground forces on the
continent, wilson argued that britain could well afford a strong army
if, as he proposes, it were to eliminate its nuclear strike force " the
socalled independent, so-called british, socalled deterrent . " thus,
if elected, wilson would " denegotiate " britain's agreement at nassau
to build a polaris submarine fleet, and hope thereby to discourage
other nations from building independent deterrents . he is strongly
opposed to giving germany a finger on the trigger, which " would be
highly provocative to the soviet union and make it even harder to get
agreements, " particularly on the matter of disarmament . belying
reports that he was " soft " on west berlin, wilson insisted that it
must remain a free and viable city, and that allied troops would have
to be stationed there " for the foreseeable future . " reservations .
there were some issues on which wilson's views were directly at odds
with those of the administration ; u.s . officials were inclined to
shrug them off as lip service to labor's left wing . most important
divergence is his support for withdrawal of nato and soviet troops from
central europe, making " nuclear-free " zones of east and west germany
and hungary a proposal that the u.s . considers impractical and
dangerous . wilson seemed as wobbly as ever on some questions, notably
the common market, which he now conditionally favors . he supports
greater east-west trade, which is not an administration goal, and
favors seating communist china in the u.n., which is directly contrary
to u.s . policy, but he told u.s . officials that these are not
high-priority aims . these views gave reason for continued reservations
about harold wilson . moreover, though his incisive, pragmatic style
undeniably impressed washington, older heads have still to be persuaded
that wilson's convictions will not shift again as they have so many
times before .

slogans, " thundered gaullist minister francois missoffe last week, "
the unions will suffer the same fate as the political parties and be
demolished . " but things did not work out quite that way . in france's
northern coal fields, 188,000 miners wore smiles of victory as they
trooped back to the pits after their bitter 35-day strike . defying a
government antistrike decree that could have resulted in fines, firings
and jail terms, the miners had won an immediate 6.5 per cent pay boost
that will rise to 12.5 per cent by next april . the humiliating defeat
for president charles de gaulle added no luster to his popular prestige
. citing an " evident correlation " between de gaulle's sagging curve
and the strike, the french institute of public opinion said that only
42 per cent of the public was currently " satisfied " with his
handling of the presidency, compared with 55 per cent in march and 64
per cent in january . but more important to de gaulle than popularity
was his fear of the strike's adverse effects on the economy . the wage
gains by miners have already touched off similar demands by other
workers in nationalized industry ; when private employees start
bargaining for a fresh round of salary hikes, the result could be as
premier georges pompidou has put it " a certain malady which is called
inflation . " le grand charles still hoped to quarantine the malady .

obstinate fight to hang onto his post, blocking the succession of

for him, " uncle ludwig " is by far the most popular politician in the
country ; a recent public-opinion poll showed that he is regarded by

europe an anthology of pros priests and kings, commissars
and parliaments have all tried to put the world's oldest profession out
of business . none succeeded . some sociologists, however, have gamely
predicted that any nation that could eliminate unemployment would also
eliminate prostitution . girls only sold their bodies, the argument
went, because there was no market for their other skills . the mobile
squad . but as prosperous, labor-short western europe last week
prepared for the summer flood of tourists, it was glaringly apparent
that the sociologists had, as usual, guessed wrong . instead of
vanishing, or even declining in numbers, prostitutes swarmed in every
european capital, from copenhagen to rome and from budapest to london .
the european economic miracle did in fact take some prostitutes off the
streets but only to put them in cars . the " klaxon girls " of milan
cruise cathedral square in lancias and dauphines, discreetly tooting
horns and flashing their headlights to attract men's attention . the
latest fashion in copenhagen has been created by " vanprostitutes, "
who cruise the streets in small trucks equipped with beds . in rome,
the first green leaves last week peeped along the lungotevere, and
flowers sprouted behind sidewalk tables on the via veneto . spring had
come, and the ladies could not be far behind . as early as 9 a.m.,
tight-skirted hustlers prowl the square before rome's modernistic
railway station ; by noon, they are ensconced on the benches of the
pincio garden, casting provocative glances over the tops of sunglasses
at passers-by ; by dinnertime, they begin congregating near rome's
biggest supermarket alongside olympic village and beside the vast ruins
of the baths of caracalla . at 9 o'clock, on the corner of via sistina
near the piazza di spagna, the prettiest prostitutes appear, dressed
not as professional hookers but as sweet little schoolgirls . in paris,
the police have succeeded in driving most brothels underground, but an
estimated 20,000 prostitutes are still available to tourists and
domestic males . the most expensive (around $20) work the
champs-elysees, and in a declining order of price and pulchritude come
the girls of the madeleine, the gare montparnasse, place pigalle and
les halles . britain's street offenses act, passed in 1959, has ended
the processions of undulating whores that used to fill up piccadilly
circus, bayswater road and hyde park . borrowing a trick from their
sisters in amsterdam, many london prostitutes now sit at the upper
windows of scruffy soho flats for which they pay as much as $150 per
week . upstairs bar . even the communist bloc has its problems with
prostitution, while indignantly denying that it exists . in hungary,
budapest's few whores are often booked up nights in advance by visiting
austrian and west german businessmen . " elisabeth of the duna, " a
witty little magyar who adorns the upstairs bar of the hotel duna, is
so famous that guards on the austrian border ask travelers, " have you
anything to declare ? did you see elisabeth ? " though flourishing
as never before in western europe, the world's oldest profession is
also continuing to take its accustomed toll . in italy, the number of
reported cases of venereal disease jumped from 1,679 in 1958 to 16,395
last year . in france, during five years of prosperity, venereal
disease skyrocketed by 385 per cent . the pros put the blame on the
semipros, the growing number of young women who work days as
secretaries or salesclerks (at wages ranging from $120 to $150 per
month) and take to the streets at night and remain largely unknown even
to the police . at week's end in paris, women were flocking to movie
theaters to watch absorbedly a new documentary film on prostitution
and, perhaps, pick up a few pointers .

killed quinim and seriously wounded his wife . when word of the murder
reached the king's residence on the banks of the mekong, it failed to

laotian charm and grew up consumed by bitterness and envy . unlike most
other laotian politicians, he did not belong to a rich or princely
family . he made a lot of money as a merchant and investor, but in
politics he was always a man of the left ; though officially a member
of souvanna phouma's neutralist party, his line was usually
indistinguishable from that of the communist pathet lao . quinim was
widely blamed for splitting the neutralist ranks and for fostering the
resentments and dissensions that led to the february assassination of a
neutralist colonel in the plaine des jarres . in his signed confession,
quinim's assassin, a lance corporal named chy kong, charged quinim with
trying to overthrow the government and bribing neutralist officers to
defect to the pathet lao forces encamped in the plaine des jarres,
where at week's end fighting broke out that caused 20 casualties .
asked if he agreed that quinim had been pro-communist, premier souvanna

malaysia forging a
prosperous nation endless rows of rubber trees stretch for miles over a
lush rubber plantation in western malaya . in the early morning hours,
women tappers extract the thick fluid that is the lifeblood of a new
british commonwealth nation that some time this summer will come into
being . it is the federation of malaysia, composed of independent
malaya, self-governing singapore, and british protectorates of sarawak,
brunei and north borneo . malaysia is the dream of malaya's prime
minister abdul rahman, 60, the man on this week's cover . he is a
cambridge-educated lawyer who led his nation to independence in 1957
during its successful, twelve-year struggle against communist guerrilla
insurgents . the largest producer of raw rubber in the world, the new
country will be the most prosperous and bustling nation in southeast
asia, encompassing 129,500 square miles and 10 million people of eleven
ethnic groups ranging from aboriginal tribesmen to millionaire sultans
. menacing its future are the expansionist aims of neighboring
indonesia and the threat of peking-directed communist subversion . but
with its successful creation, malaysia pictured and discussed in the
color pages and cover story that follow could become the strongest
anti-communist bulwark in southeast asia .
malaysia
malaysia will cut a 1,600-mile arc through the south china sea, from
the southern border of thailand through the malay peninsula and
singapore to the north coast of borneo . politically and economically,
malaya is the keystone of the federation . with its population of
7,000,000, malaya will dominate the new nation's government, which will
sit in the malayan capital of kuala lumpur . the melting-pot quality of
the new federation is a reflection of malaya's own
conglomeration of malays, chinese, tamils, pygmy negritos, and other
aboriginal tribesmen in the dank, tangled tropical rain forests of the
interior . off the southern tip of malaya is the island state of
singapore, teeming with 1,700,000 people . one of the largest ports in
the world, singapore has the highest annual per capita income in
southeast asia $450 . singapore's chinese population, with strong ties
to red china, presents the new nation with the pressing
problem of communist domination . but singapore has the most
powerful military installations in southeast asia, will be the home
base for the british army, navy and air force units that will be
malaysia's primary defense . the three tiny colonies of sarawak (pop .
784,000), brunei (pop . 84,000) and north borneo (pop . 480,000),
separated from malaya and singapore by 400 miles of the south china
sea, were included in the federation mainly to redress its population
balance in favor of the non-chinese peoples .
many of the people in the three jungle territories are half-naked
primitive natives who live communally in longhouses, worship animist
water spirits, and hunt with blow guns and poisoned darts ; in north
borneo the dusuns venerate cloud-capped mount kinabulu (13,455 ft.),
highest peak in southeast asia, as the gateway to paradise . as inland
roads are all but nonexistent, river canoes are the main form of
transportation

yields, area has to import much of the rice it uses 35 per cent in 1961
noodles drying at

peppers, they are second in popularity only to rice .
oil from fields in tiny brunei has
brought geyser of wealth to british protectorate . but even with modern
rigs, oil production is now falling off, has dropped 37 per cent since
record high in 1956 .
rubber workers trek liquid latex to
plantation smokehouse . rubber is no . 1 cash crop, and malaya accounts
for one-third world's supply .
tin has been mined for
centuries in fields of malaya, which still produce 40 per cent of free
world's supply . european and u.s . firms account for half of
production, while smaller mines are owned by chinese .

malaysia manila hummed with excitement as delegates gathered for the
third annual meeting of the association of southeast asia . phalanxes
of motorcycle police escorted shiny official limousines to meetings at
the modernistic pavilion of the national science development board . in
the paneled, high-ceilinged conference room and at diplomatic cocktail
parties, an endless stream of dignitaries strolled up to greet the man
who was the focus of everyone's attention, malaya's stocky, smiling
prime minister abdul rahman, 60, the golf-playing ex-playboy who this
summer will bring into being a new asian nation . to one and all, abdul
rahman happily took credit for the formation of the malaysian
federation . as he puts it, " i am the father of malaysia . " strictly
speaking, this is not true ; the idea has long been the dream of asian
nationalists . for years, britain too has advocated the plan as a neat
way to tie up all its remaining asian colonies (with the exception of
hong kong) into one tidy independent package . but the tunku (it means
prince) was the indispensable catalyst without whom malaysia could not
have been achieved . he wooed, bullied and cajoled the four other
countries into the federation agreement, was the only logical choice to
serve as the new nation's first prime minister . happy, not mighty .
unlike most other new asian leaders, abdul rahman is no rabid
nationalist . he has remained on close, friendly terms with the
british, has no interest in pie-in-the-sky economic schemes . his
political aims are simple : " food instead of bullets, clothing
instead of uniforms, houses instead of barracks . " his new nation has
a combat army of only seven battalions and an air force so small that
the pilots often have trouble finding a fourth for bridge . " my
ambition is not a mighty malaysia, " says abdul rahman, " but happy
malaysia . " but many pressing problems threaten the tunku's ambition .
malaysia's current prosperity is endangered by its dependence on a
one-crop economy . synthetics have already captured half the world's
annual 5,000,000-ton rubber market and forced down the price of latex .
on top of this, brunei's oil reserves are fast depleting . to counter
the economic threat, malaya has embarked on an ambitious
diversification program, is offering a fiveyear tax holiday to new
industries and pushing a big land-development program for new cash
crops . politically, malaysia has already experienced some acute pains
. fearful that a stable new nation will curb communist subversion in
southeast asia, russia has branded the federation " a cunning invention
of london " set up with the " unqualified support of u.s . imperialists
. " both neighboring indonesia and the philippines have launched a
campaign of invective against the whole idea .
walls of prejudice . by far
malaysia's most complex and festering problem is the simmering racial
hostility between the new nation's chinese and malay populations .
throughout the federation, the astute, prosperous, hard-bargaining
chinese dominate business, industry and trade, have economically far
outstripped the rural, easygoing malays . chinese tycoons control north
borneo's booming young timber industry and sarawak's vast, rolling
pepper gardens ; in malaya, abdul rahman's government has complained
that the rich, inbred chinese business community has erected a " wall
of prejudice " against ambitious young malay businessmen . the malays
have built some walls of their own . by malayan law, only onequarter of
the government jobs can go to non-malays, while malays get special
concessions in the granting of scholarships and licenses for new
businesses . rigid citizenship requirements have been set up for the
chinese (malays are automatically citizens), and the borneo territories
plan immigration restrictions to keep chinese businessmen out . "
special privileges are like a golf handicap, " rationalizes malaya's
chinese finance minister tan siew sin . " they are not to hold the
chinese down, but to help the malays along . " golf every morning . it
is ironically fitting that the complicated problems of federation are
the province of a man who, on the face of it, is so uncomplicated
himself . " i am a lazy man, " admits abdul rahman cheerfully, and six
years as malaya's prime minister have not altered his easygoing ways .
the tunku plays golf every morning (handicap : 24), checks the racing
calendar before making advance political engagements, always takes a
nap in the afternoon . an avid soccer fan and sports-car buff, he is
chronically late for appointments, explains : " being punctual always
wears me out . " the tunku has the charisma of the really successful
politician . his title draws enormous respect from the masses, and at
the same time his genuine charm and easygoing manner quickly win their
confidence . though he is a devout moslem, abdul rahman enjoys brandy
and soda ; he is also an excellent curry cook . with his third wife,
sharifah rodziah, and their four adopted children (two of whom are
chinese), the tunku leads a life of cheerful disorder in kuala
lumpur's open, airy prime minister's residence, allows the 70 children
of his servants the run of the house ; visiting diplomats are often
surprised during a conference to see a servant's child wander into the
sitting room and climb up onto the tunku's lap . the tunku has solved
the problem of paper work simply : he does not read it . he has always
had an aversion to the printed page, as a student picked up the knack
of absorbing pertinent passages from books or papers that were read
aloud to him . but though he has no intellectual pretensions, the tunku
commands unswerving loyalty from his brilliant subordinates for his
almost charmed ability to avoid political mistakes . says an aide : "
he understands the malay mind better than anyone else ever has . "
abdul rahman agrees . " i have the feel of the people, " he says . " i
have the touch . " the
tunku's first wife, who died of malaria in 1935, was the mother of his
two children, daughter kathijah, 29, wife of a malayan studying in
britain, and son nerang, 27, now a major in the malayan army . his
second wife was a white englishwoman, violet coulson, whom he married
over the protests of his family ; they were divorced in 1946 .
the playboy prince . abdul rahman
was the seventh son of his father's sixth wife and, with his 44
brothers and sisters, lived the plush life befitting the offspring of
the sultan of kedah . his siamese mother demanded that he be carried to
school on the shoulders of a retainer, and though he was an indifferent
student, his royal birth won him a scholarship to cambridge, where he
began to read law . but the tunku skipped most of his lectures, seldom
missed a tea or dinnerdance, distinguished himself mainly by picking up
28 traffic violations in his silver riley with red fenders . not
unexpectedly, the playboy prince flunked his bar exams . so far down
the line of succession that he had no chance of ever attaining his
father's sultanate, the tunku returned to malaya as a minor civil
servant in a number of remote outposts . on foot and on elephant, he
traveled through the bush getting to know the land and the people, once
even worked as a manual laborer to help build a new mosque, which the
grateful malays named rahmaniah after him . world war ii and japan's
swift conquest of the malayan peninsula hastened abdul rahman's
maturity . as a useful district officer, the tunku was kept on the job
by the japanese . secretly, however, he helped hide escapees from
japanese death camps, kept in contact with british guerrilla units,
which were supplying arms to anti-japanese communist irregulars in the
jungles . " who the hell is he ? " abdul rahman was also in contact
with the malayan independence movement that began to take root when the
japanese ousted the british . with the end of the war, at the age of
42, the tunku returned to england to get his law degree, began to play
a larger part in the cause of merdeka (freedom) . he insisted that it
was the duty of every malay in britain to join the nationalistic malay
society . because of his age and long experience in the civil service,
younger malay students looked to him as their leader, called him
because of his darker skin " black uncle . " in fiery political bull
sessions with youthful follower tun abdul razak, the seeds of a future
political partnership were being sown ; today razak is the most
trusted member of his cabinet . back home, the middle-aging lawyer
joined the united malay nationalist organization, slowly began building
up a political following in his native kedah . in other malay states,
the tunku's firebrand followers from the london days began pushing him
for the party leadership ; finally, in 1951, abdul rahman took over as
boss of the u.m.n.o . " nobody had ever heard of him, " an official
recalls . " i remember people asking " who the hell is he ? " ' they
soon found out . convinced that he could only achieve national
leadership at the head of a multiracial united front, abdul rahman
muted hotly anti-chinese sentiment in his own malay party, stumped the
country urging chinese and indian leaders to unite behind him under the
banner of a new organization called the alliance party . to finance his
crusade, he sold his expensive cars and most of his other property . "
i worked like mad, living and sleeping on trains, " says the tunku . "
i was often home only one day a month . " but abdul rahman's zeal paid
off . in the 1955 general election, the alliance swept 51 of the 52
seats in the federal legislature, and the tunku took over as chief
minister under the british high commissioner . merdeka . abdul rahman
was so busy politicking that he had taken little military interest in
the brutal, bloody guerrilla war that 350,000 british and malayan
troops and home guardsmen were waging against communist insurgents in
malaya's tangled jungles . but after his 1955 election landslide, the
tunku grew afraid that the british might use the emergency to delay
independence, arranged to meet the communist rebel chieftains in
northern malaya to see if some sort of settlement could be worked out .
/ my ideas about communism were determined by that meeting, " says the
tunku . " i became convinced that once a communist, always a communist
. they could never coexist with us in an independent malaya . /
as the war in the jungle began taking a
turn for the better, abdul rahman flintily told britain that the time
was long overdue for malaya's independence . after months of haggling
and delay, the tunku finally forced britain's colonial secretary alan
lennox-boyd (now lord boyd) to the conference table . throughout the
grueling, three-week session in london, the tunku refused to budge from
his ultimatum that independence must come no later than aug . 31, 1957
. " when the siamese have no intention of yielding, they just appear
stupid, " he told subordinates . " i'm half siamese, you know . " at
last, lennox-boyd got the point and caved in . on the tunku's target
date, independent malaya at last came into being . " good old tunku . "
the tunku had no revolutionary blueprint for his new nation, brought
into his cabinet his old london crony, abdul razak, to hammer out a
program for orderly progress . while abdul rahman ground down hard on
red subversives, minister of rural development razak (in the post he
will retain in malaysia's new government) started a program of new
roads, schools and clinics to boost the standard of living in the
primitive kampongs (villages), where the communists were trying to gain
a foothold . in the air-conditioned " operations room " of his
ministry, gadget-loving razak carefully watched the progress of his
bulldozers on dozens of charts, movie screens and map displays, kept
his program constantly ahead of schedule with his cold insistence on
results or else . abdul rahman made no effort to squeeze the british
out of the country, was convinced that the continued economic and
military presence of the british was the best possible insurance for
malayan stability . today a british officer commands the malayan army,
five senior british civil servants hold key positions in malayan
government ministries, and british businessmen control more than half
of the rubber industry, repatriate $86 million in profits annually . "
it's wonderful how this place has flowered since independence, " says
one businessman . " we're really much better off . good old tunku . "
parleys on the green . with his young nation booming, abdul rahman
looked with increasing fear at the predicament of neighboring
singapore, just three-quarters of a mile across the johore strait .
there communism was spreading like an infection among the underfed,
underemployed masses in singapore's squalid, teeming tenement quarters
. by strikes, riots and boycotts, the peking-oriented, communist-front
barisan socialist party tried to topple the tottering government glued
together by singapore's shifty, brilliant, cambridge-educated prime
minister lee kuan yew, 39 . never too choosy about where he got
political support, " harry " lee first tried cooperation with the
communists, later adopted a " leftist, not extremist, noncommunist, not
anti-communist " policy . it did not work ,save his political neck, he
was forced to go for help to an old golfing partner abdul rahman .
lee's vacation house bordered a fairway of kuala kumpur's rambling
selangor golf club, where the tunku shot his daily round . from tee to
green, lee tried to convince abdul rahman that singapore's rickety
coalition could never survive another election, and that a red
singapore could only spell trouble for malaya . gradually, the tunku
came to the frightening conclusion that singapore might well become " a
chinese cuba . " one solution to the " singapore problem " was obvious
: a merger, so that malaya's powerful internal security police could
move in and help singapore authorities hold red subversion in check .
but the tunku shuddered at the prospect of upsetting his nation's malay
racial preponderance by the addition of singapore's 1,300,000 chinese .
/ in order to balance the population, " he says, " i thought of the
borneo territories . /
wining & dining . sarawak, brunei and
north borneo, however, were less than enthusiastic about the federation
scheme . borneo leaders resented being invited to join merely as a
political and racial accommodation, desired instead some sort of
independence of their own . then britain began putting quiet pressure
on the three territorial governments, tried to persuade them that union
in malaysia offered them far more economic and political power than
they could ever achieve by themselves . but it was abdul rahman who
sold the scheme . the tunku wined and dined a continuous stream of
borneo delegations in kuala lumpur, warmed up borneo leaders cool to
the federation with promises of favored political positions in the new
nation . he shrewdly offered the borneo territories 70 seats in the
federal parliament, against only 15 for far more populous singapore and
104 for malaya . he promised tax concessions and a $12 million dollop
of malayan aid annually to the territories, agreed to keep federal
hands off brunei's oil reserves . it was the tunku's fondest hope that
the new nation come into being on aug . 31, 1963, the sixth anniversary
of malaya's independence . then last december came a blow that
threatened to destroy the tunku's timetable . it was the uprising in
brunei . " just too much . " discontent with the sultan of brunei's
corrupt, inefficient and autocratic regime had long been festering in
the tiny, delaware-sized territory . last year the sultan's government
spent only $50,000 on drugs and medicine for its people, while laying
out $47,000 for electrical illumination on the sultan's birthday action
on requests to the government usually took from six months to three
years . the dominant but powerless people's party was also dead-set
against malaysia ; the party's erratic, goateed onetime veterinarian
leader, sheik a . m . azahari, 34, wanted instead to align brunei,
sarawak and north borneo into a single independent state with himself
as its leader . when it finally erupted, the revolt was poorly
organized and badly led . four battalions of britain's tough little
gurkha troops landed on brunei, inside of a week sent the shattered
remnants of the 3,000man rebel army scuttling back into hiding in
brunei's steaming jungles . but the brunei revolt at last gave the
philippines and indonesia, for different reasons, an excuse to display
their opposition to the scheme . oblivious to malaya's success against
red infiltration, the philippines feared that leftists would ultimately
take over the new nation, thus putting a cummunist neighbor right on
their doorstep . dusting off an old claim to north borneo, the
philippines maintained that in 1878 the sultan of sulu had only "
leased, " not sold, the territory to the british . london stiffly
rejected the filipino claim to the region .
indonesia shouted that the turmoil
showed the deep dissatisfaction with malaysia in the borneo
territories, and that the federation was only a plot to extend
britain's colonial influence in asia . rabble-rousing president sukarno
knew that a british-backed, economically viable malaysia would not only
derail his ambition to extend his influence over the borneo
territories, but might also serve as an inducement to rebellion for the
people of depressed indonesian borneo . moreover, abdul rahman has
ignored every " revolutionary principle " for which sukarno stands, has
in the process created a conservative, prosperous nation, while
revolutionary, leftist indonesia, with its 100 million people, has slid
to the edge of economic ruin . says a diplomat :. " to have a little
country like this extending its influence in southeast asia was just
too much for sukarno . " sound ground . in a drumfire of propaganda
outbursts, indonesia hailed the " brunei freedom fighters, " lashed out
at " british mercenaries and puppets, " granted political asylum to
brunei leader azahari, raved that abdul rahman was " round the bend . "
(retorted the tunku : " what can you expect from a pig but a grunt ?
/ ) djakarta mobs hanged the tunku in effigy, and sukarno declared a "
policy of confrontation " against malaya . indonesian jets buzzed
malayan ships in the south china sea, and army leaders darkly
threatened " incidents of physical conflict " along the border of
brunei and indonesia . sukarno did not dare to invade ; he plainly
hoped to induce the united nations to step in and placate him as it did
with west new guinea thus sparing him the necessity of fighting for
what he wants . however, the u.n . seems unwilling to play sukarno's
game ; a u.n . observer team told him that malaysia is " on sound
legal ground . " promise to " brothers . " last week in manila, the
acrid dispute between indonesia, the philippines, and malaysia added an
undertone of tension to the otherwise calm meeting of the association
of southeast asia . not on the official agenda, the malaysia question
came up repeatedly in long private discussions between abdul rahman and
philippines president diosdado macapagal . the tunku was anxious for
the whole matter to be settled quietly . in an attempt to be reasonable
and friendly with his " malay brothers, " he agreed to look into the
filipino claim to north borneo, lukewarmly endorsed a proposal for an
asian summit meeting between himself, macapagal, and indonesia's
sukarno . but the tunku vetoed the suggestion that he postpone the
creation of malaysia until some settlement could be reached ; the
federation, he said, would come into being by aug . 31 as planned .
from the standpoint of language, religion, culture or geography,
malaysia is not a natural nation . but abdul rahman has faced problems
similar to malaysia's in his own malaya and there a decent society has
flourished . he does not promise the moon to his new nation, only a
sane, humane, workable government . under his leadership, malaysia can
be, as john f . kennedy has said, " the best hope of security in that
vital part of the world . /

with his allies . in paris to attend a meeting of the south-east asia
treaty organization, secretary of state dean rusk chatted " cordially "
with france's president for about 35 minutes, counting time out for
translation . britain's foreign secretary lord home and france's
foreign minister maurice couve de murville, who have been snubbing one
another ever since britain was excluded from the common market last
january, also exchanged civilities . what's more, at an elysee palace
reception for seato delegates from eight countries, le grand charles
affably declared : " security means cooperation . " subs, please . was
this progress ? skeptics noted that france's government seemed more
inclined to talk cooperation than to practice it . after indicating
that they might honor a 15-month-old agreement to accept
u.s.-controlled warheads for its german-based f-100 fighterbombers, the
french brusquely denied that they had any present plans " concerning
the use of these planes within nato . " nothing daunted, u.s .
officials in paris leaked wishful reports that france's nuclear force
de frappe is badly behind schedule and beset with evermounting
technical and financial problems . de gaulle, it was hinted, was about
ready to return to the nato fold . not so, retorted a high-ranking
french official . france, he insisted, will have its first 50 mirage iv
a-bombers in service by december 1965, on schedule ; expects to have
its own h-bomb " well before " 1970 ; and is actually ahead of
schedule with its missile-launching submarine, now due in 1968 . thus
de gaulle had no reason to back away from his declared aim of nuclear
independence . as the gaullist paris-presse pointed out, " it is his
partners who have greatly changed their tone " since the general
rejected the u.s . offer of nato-committed polaris missiles last
january . the u.s . was still pushing its long-term plan for a surface
polaris fleet manned by mixed crews . however, britain has little
enthusiasm for the idea, while west germany and italy, which were both
enthusiastic at first, have now indicated that they would rather sink
their money in multimanned polaris submarines . what the u.s . did win
last week was substantial agreement from its allies excluding france on
the general outline of a more limited scheme, the inter-allied,
natocontrolled strike force that washington hopes to create in the near
future . just a gimmick ? after a nato session in paris and
conferences in london attended by rusk, defense secretary mcnamara and
other top policymakers, the u.s . announced that it would present next
month's nato meeting in ottawa with detailed plans for a nuclear
command and planning structure to integrate the new inter-allied force
. it would include britain's v-bombers and, in 1968, its polaris fleet,
as well as three polaris submarines that the u.s . has committed to
nato, and other allied aircraft and missiles . some allied planners
dismissed the u.s . proposals as mere " gimmickry . " but after all it
was western europe that had been clamoring for a greater role in
nuclear weapons policy . now washington had produced a plan that would
go a long way toward meeting this demand . most european countries
seemed anxious to cooperate . paris remained stiffly aloof, suggesting
only that in the event of war, its own deterrent might be " coordinated
/ with a nato nuclear force . if any u.s . officials really believed,
as they said last week, that the french had shown a more " positive "
attitude toward the western alliance, they gravely misjudged the aims
of charles de gaulle . snapped a german diplomat : " of course the
crisis isn't over . and it won't be as long as de gaulle is around . "

yugoslavia how to win job security like many durable dictators,
yugoslavia's marshal tito preserves his one-man rule by the simple
expedient of holding down the key jobs himself . he is
secretary-general of the communist party, supreme commander of the
armed forces, and chief of state . as if that were not enough,
belgrade's complaisant federal people's republic unanimously approved a
new national constitution last week giving tito the presidency for
life. while his handsome wife jovanka beamed down from a visitors'
box, tito strode into the hall to the cheers of the crowd and sat
gravely through a formal reading of the new charter . afterward,
looking remarkably fit for a man who will be 71 next month, he happily
autographed copies of the constitution . in addition to sanctifying
tito's supremacy, the document included other novelties . a new
assembly will be composed of no fewer than five chambers, each with its
own specialty . one will deal with economics, others with education,
social, general administrative, and federal matters . for the first
time, there will be a premier and a vice president, although neither
one is designated to succeed tito in the event of his sudden death .
their powers will be strictly limited . under the new constitution, the
communist party remains the " fundamental initiator of political
activity . " spain's
francisco franco is the only other dictator with legal life tenure as
chief of state . ghana's strongman president, kwame nkrumah, was voted
permanently into office in september, but his high dedication modestly
vetoed the gesture, preferring to rely on elections a safe enough
gesture since the country is officially a one-party state .

middle east union now the arab world last week reeled in
a delirium of joy . damascus radio repeatedly shrieked, " ahlan bil
wahda ! " (welcome to union) . when syrian soldiers sent bursts of
tracer bullets streaking against the night sky, the radio announcer
hastily told his excited listeners that it was not revolution but
jubilation . the dream has come true ! headlined a beirut paper .
aleppo nearly exploded : its main streets became a sea of screaming
humanity, and cars inched along honking their horns to the rhythm, "
nas-ser ! " algeria's premier ahmed ben bella cabled that this was "
the most wonderful day of my life ! " and yemen's strongman, abdullah
sallal, hailed the " outstanding historic event . " cheering crowds
milled through aden and kuwait and baghdad . festering wound . what
thrilled the arab world was the cairo announcement that egypt, syria
and iraq had at last agreed to unite in a tripartite federation . the
terms of union were far stronger and more centralized than arabs, or
anyone else, had expected . there had been much talk of a loose
association of nations moving slowly over the years toward actual unity
. but the pulsing enthusiasm of the moment apparently swept aside much
of the earlier restraint . a few dozen men in cairo were groping for
the political blueprint for a nation stronger, richer and more powerful
than any arab state for centuries past . if it all works out, the
proposed new middle eastern power complex will cover 620,300 sq . mi.,
stretch from the borders of turkey and iran to sudan and libya, from
the persian gulf to the mediterranean and far down the red sea coast .
it would have a population of 40 million people (expected to reach 80
million by 1985, greater than the largest nation of western europe) and
a total gross national product of $5.7 billion . hero of the hour was
egypt's president gamal abdel nasser . better than any man, he knew
that, on the historical record, the odds were against success . time
and again, the cherished dream of arab oneness has been shattered on
the irrationality of arab behavior, on personal rivalries, ambitions,
class differences and complicated levantine intrigues . amid shouts of
arab joy, egypt and syria forged the united arab republic in 1958, only
to see it collapse in a welter of bickering three years later . during
the past five weeks of negotiations in cairo, rumors spread of
wrangling and dissension between nasser on one side and the syrian and
iraqi leaders of the socialist baath party on the other . both picked
at the " festering wound " caused by baath's breakup of the earlier,
ill-starred union of egypt and syria in the united arab republic . each
put the blame for failure on the other . finally, at a plenary session
in the giltand-cream great hall of kubbah palace, nasser proposed a
sharing of guilt . " the presence of baath in the arab homeland is a
necessity, " he declared . " the resignation of the baath ministers
from the u.a.r . government in 1961 was a mistake . accepting the
resignations was also a mistake . " the baathist delegates clapped and
cheered this burying of the hatchet . in a startlingly un-arab spirit
of amity and compromise, both sides accepted the other's good faith and
minimum terms .
cheerful borrowing . the points of agreement announced
by egypt's premier ali sabry include a federal state retaining the name
of the united arab republic, with cairo as its capital . all citizens
would share one nationality, but each of the three regions would be
self-governing and in control of its separate economy . the overall
government based in cairo would have a single president (almost
certainly nasser), a presidential council with members from each region
and a bicameral legislature : a house with one member for each 60,000
citizens, and a senate representing the regions equally without regard
to population . the arab press cheerfully admitted that much was
borrowed from the u.s . constitution because it provided the " ideal
form of union as proven by experience . " sticking point is nasser's
insistence on a single political party for the whole
u.a.r., modeled on his own arab socialist union in egypt . since this
would swallow up and probably destroy the baath movement, baathists
have held out for a looser, more representative system, including the
baath-created national front in iraq, and the baathist-nasserite
unionist front in syria . in the end, nasser would probably have his
way on this, as on other limitations to political democracy . a cairo
spokesman explained, in a phrase definitely not borrowed from u.s .
democracy, that " freedom will be guaranteed to the people, but not to
the enemies of the people . " there are many lesser matters still to be
decided . committees would be assigned to work out details of currency,
customs, postage, diplomatic and other policies . foreign affairs would
be under the new u.a.r . government, and embassies abroad would be
merged . the u.a.r., however, may try to hang on to its three united
nations seats in much the same way that the soviet union controls the
votes of the ukraine and byelorussia . freed slaves . many observers
suspect that this new ship of state may go swiftly on the rocks, but
few of them are in the arab world . twelve members of oil-rich kuwait's
50-man legislature formally requested unity with the u.a.r . even
nasser's traditional enemies, the monarchies of jordan and saudi
arabia, made efforts at reconciliation . jordan's king hussein
discreetly let 56 nasserite and baathist political prisoners out of
jail and sent off friendly feelers to nasser . in saudi arabia, alarmed
by a pro-nasser demonstration that cost 19 lives, premier prince feisal
tried to modernize his regime by allotting $1,200,000 as compensation
to slave ownerswho would free their chattels . at week's end cairo
radio was spreading word of a cease-fire by mutual agreement in
rebellion-torn yemen . it said that saudi arabia was prepared to stop
supplying the royalists supporting ex-imam badr with money and
munitions, while nasser may withdraw a token contingent of his
28,000-man egyptian expeditionary force by april 20 . though nasser's
broadcasters are not the most reliable sources in the world, things may
well come to this, for without doubt jordan and saudi arabia and all
other arabs are becoming increasingly anxious to avoid angering nasser

luxembourg millennium in camelot on an april day in 963, count
sigfroi, a wagnerian warrior from the ardennes, raised his banner over
a fortress on a formidable rock above the alzette river in the eastern
frankish empire . though sigfroi's wife soon vanished she turned out to
be a water nymph and his fortress crumbled, the fief he founded proved
as durable as it is diminutive . it is formally known today as the
grand duchy of luxembourg and, though international surveys often omit
its statistics entirely, it is a thriving charter member of the
european coal and steel community and the common market, as well as the
smallest country in the united nations, in whose behalf it sent an
armed and eager platoon to korea in 1951 . last week, as they marked
their country's 1,000th anniversary, the solid, easygoing
luxembourgeois looked forward to a long summer of low-key celebration,
including a dog show, endless wine festivals, an international stamp
exposition, and a visit by two planeloads of kinfolk from chicago,
which is said to boast more luxembourgeois than luxembourg (pop .
320,000). the mystery is why they ever left in the first place . dial
219-61 . the grand duchy today is a sort of constitutional camelot . it
boasts 130 castles (but no university), pristine forests where wild
boar are still hunted, crystalline rivers that teem with crayfish,
trout and, of course, water nymphs . the luxembourgeois, who are
walking advertisements for their cuisine (famed specialties : thrush
pie and partridge canape), brag that it is " french in quality, german
in quantity . " in other respects as well, they claim to have europe's
highest living standards . there is neither unemployment nor slums ;
illiteracy was banished in 1847, and the duchy's booming steel industry
is one of the world's most productive . " luxembourg, " its citizens
say with satisfaction, " belongs to the luxembourgeois . " politically,
luxembourg is a familystyle democracy in which street cleaners greet
the prime minister by his first name . if a citizen gets mad at the
government, he has only to dial 219-61 to hear a telephone operator
reply, " the government, " and direct him promptly to the appropriate
official . for economy's sake, virtually every member of the cabinet
runs at least two ministries . premier pierre werner, 49, who is also
minister of finance, is a genial, tireless christian socialist who
bustles around the country in an ancient official buick as concernedly
as if the grand duchy all 999 square miles of it were about to melt
away altogether . a lot to offer . actually, political crises are few
and far between in placid luxembourg . through tactful treatment of
minorities, the government has avoided the fate of neighboring belgium,
where bitter antagonisms between flemish and french-speaking citizens
are a constant threat to stability . the luxembourgeois, who speak
french, german and a gobbledydeutsch called mosel-frankisch, do not
even have an official language . they are 96.9 per cent catholic, but
the government pays the salaries of the country's sole rabbi and its
only protestant minister . even the country's few communists profess
loyalty to the royal family . titular head of state since 1919 has been
the handsome, highly esteemed grand duchess charlotte, 67, who later
this month will pay her first official visit to the u.s . since she
escaped in world war ii to head her government in exile . indeed,
though they put up a heroic resistance against the germans in two world
wars, in peacetime the luxembourgeois keep to themselves as a matter of
principle . some western diplomats would like to see the country play a
more assertive role in world affairs . " they have a lot to offer, "
argues one . " internationally, luxembourg is the voice of 20th century
europeanism, the voice of reason in the common market, nato and the u.n
. but it is too modest . " in fact one of president kennedy's
underlying reasons for inviting the grand duchess to washington is to
suggest that luxembourg should use its moderating influence more
readily . but the luxembourgeois are not likely to change their ways .
/ when cats fight, " they explain, " kittens should stay out of the way
. /
many also emigrated to new england, notably franklin roosevelt's
maternal ancestors, the delanos (originally delanois), whose old
castle in northern luxembourg now houses a first-class hotel .

crackdown on evtushenko and other maverick intellectuals . the official

that would reduce the high-living poet to poverty, since state
publishing houses would no longer accept his work . even cosmonaut yuri

hungary " while we wait " for hungarian writers and artists,
whose demands for freedom inspired the 1956 revolution, word of
russia's restalinization of culture at first caused a bad case of
jitters . yet last week, in striking contrast to the clamp-down in
moscow, budapest seemed almost relaxed . said cultural commissar istvan
szirmai : " the party will be tolerant . all artistic and literary
creations which are not anticommunist will be allowed . " hungarian
intellectuals earned their meager allowance the hard way . communist
boss janos kadar, after betraying his country to the kremlin during the
uprising, for four years tried to whip the country into submission by
brutal use of police terror . but kadar eventually learned that he
could not force the sullen hungarians to cooperate . with his civil
service in tatters and economy a shambles, he gradually relaxed
controls, even began naming non-communist experts to key industrial
jobs . " he who is not against us is with us, " said kadar in late 1961
. such relative leniency in a communist state at last earned kadar a
measure of grudging acceptance from the population ; fortnight ago he
took his biggest step yet by releasing the last group of revolutionary
leaders who were still in jail (although up to several hundred
rank-and-file freedom fighters are still believed to be behind bars),
and by setting the stage for the release of josef cardinal mindszenty
from his refuge in budapest's u.s . legation (time, april 12) . happy
enough to be outside the cells, hungarian intellectuals, traditionally
an enthusiastically undisciplined bunch, avoided provoking fresh
trouble ; for one thing, they know that soviet tanks are always ready
to rumble into the city . as laszlo nemeth, a respected non-communist
author, puts it : " we hungarians live today in a new apartment block
which many people find ugly . it became clear in 1956 that the block
cannot be demolished . while we wait behind the facade for its
transformation into something better, let us at least make our own

jordan cloudburst at petra john william burgon, a 19th century
british clergyman and minor poet, wrote a memorable line when he
described ancient petra as " a rose-red city half as old as time . "
romantic, inaccessible, it lies in the midst of a vast desert in
southern jordan, and today, as always, its only approach is through a
deep, narrow gorge called the siq, which tradition says was created
when moses struck the rock with his rod . from 300 b.c . to a.d . 100,
when petra flourished as the caravan capital of the nabataeans, the siq
made the city impregnable, since a few men in the serpentine gorge,
often no more than two yards wide, could hold up an army . today, the
narrow three-mile course is traveled by thousands of tourists who go to
gape at the elaborate tombs and temples built into rock that is colored
crimson, sepia, brown and violet, like watered silk . desert sprinkle .
two parties of foreigners reached the entrance to the siq one day last
week, eager to journey the remaining three miles to petra . the first
was a group of 23 frenchwomen making a holy land pilgrimage under the
tutelage of a parisian priest, abbe jean steinmann, 52, vicar of notre
dame ;  the second was a larger group of italian pilgrims . the
french party gaily entered the siq gorge just as a sprinkle of rain
began to fall . four were traveling in a landrover, the rest on foot .
suddenly, the light rain became a cloudburst the worst in arid petra's
recorded history . within half an hour, torrential floods were
streaming down from the hills and cliffs and pouring into the siq as
into a funnel . one italian pilgrim said, " we heard shrieks and cries
within the ravine, as the muddy cascade of water rushed by us . we saw
the little car with the four women and the driver swept along by the
torrent and then submerged . in an instant, they all disappeared in the
floodwaters raging along at perhaps 60 miles an hour . " prayers on the
ledge . two young frenchwomen, who were dawdling along behind the
party, heard the roar of the oncoming flood and managed to scramble up
the rock wall to a ledge 12 feet above the ground . " the water rose
higher and higher, " said one . " it gradually reached our feet, then
our knees . we could not see the others, but we heard their cries .
soon we heard nothing but the thundering water . we clung to the ledge
and prayed . " those two were saved, but when the flood subsided three
hours later, the muddy floor of the gorge was littered with sodden,
battered bodies abbe steinmann, two arabs (a guide and a driver), and
21 frenchwomen . petra police flashed word of the disaster to amman
and, dropping everything, king hussein flew his helicopter to the siq
gorge and personally directed operations . the two survivors were
rushed to comfortable quarters in hussein's basman palace . the 22
others, who never quite reached the rose-red tombs of petra, were
embalmed for air shipment and burial at home in france .
a famed biblical specialist, abbe steinmann
wrote several books on the prophets, but in 1961 his life of jesus was
placed on the vatican's index of banned works, and a year later the
church forbade him any further biblical publications . however, abbe
steinmann remained vicar of notre dame .

squeeze on the blue house last week, and south korea's month-long
political crisis vanished for the moment . bowing to washington's
wishes, general park chung hee, who occupies seoul's blue-roofed
presidential mansion, agreed to let civilian politicians have their say
at least until next autumn . the victory belonged in large part to the
man who relayed the u.s . pressure, short, wiry, u.s . ambassador
semuel d . berger . called " silent sam " by the korean press for his
reluctance to make public pronouncements, careerist berger, 51, is a
discreet, behind-the-scenes diplomat . when general park
last month imposed a new ban on civilian political activities and
announced a referendum designed to keep his military junta in power for
another four years, berger set about the task of convincing the general
that he must abide by his pledge to president kennedy 17 months ago to
restore civilian rule in 1963 . berger's lever was the u.s.'s annual
$500 million aid program to south korea, without which park's
government could not remain solvent . to a steady stream of top korean
officials who came to the fourstory u.s . embassy in downtown seoul,
berger explained that the u.s . might have to re-examine its aid
program unless park let the civilians come back . to show that berger
was not bluffing, the u.s . recently delayed a promised $25 million
desperately needed by south korea to pay for import purchases . when
park finally caved in last week, agreeing to wait until september to
decide whether to call for free elections or a vote on his referendum,
civilian politicians were at first inclined to grumble at park's
compromise . but in fact, they needed that much time to organize their
parties for an election campaign . the civilians knew who their most
potent opponent would be : general park himself, who no doubt would
use the six-month postponement to build up a grass-roots political
organization strong enough to help him switch from fatigues to flannels
and take office as a civilian president .

. st . john 19 : 17 promptly at 9 : 30 p.m . on good friday last
week, a grotesque lump of a man emerged from the medieval roman
catholic church in corsica's olive-growing village of sartene .
barefoot, masked in a blood-red hood with eye slits, the bent figure
staggered under the weight of a massive oak cross . from his right
ankle dragged a clanking, 31-lb . chain . and from under the hood came
an anguished, muffled chant : " perdonno, mio dio . . . perdonno . . . "
thus, as it has every spring since the middle ages, began one of the
world's most brutally powerful easter week processions . the hooded
figure was that of a conscience-stricken french sinner whose identity
was known only to the local curate, father jean baptiste scuitti . from
wherever he had come, the man was there voluntarily to atone for his
sins by enacting the role of christ making his way to calvary . to
corsicans, as always, he was known only as le catenacciu (the enchained
one) . so popular is the part that it is booked solid for the next 40
years by applicants from as far away as madagascar . the list includes
gamblers, adulterers, ex-convicts all seeking peace of mind . with it,
they get an awful lot of exercise . the procession, chuckles father
scuitti, " is no evening promenade . " in last week's mock trip to
calvary, a short, fat man grunted and puffed as he bore the cross along
a mile-and-a-half route . coming out of the church, the catenacciu got
his huge load stuck in the doorway . then, as he stumbled along dirt
paths and darkened, cobbled streets, struggled painfully up flights of
ancient granite stairs, his bare feet began to bleed . throngs of
villagers and 15,000 tourists in sartene for the occasion gathered
along the route to jeer . three times the catenacciu fell under his
burden, and each time a fellow penitent playing the part of simon of
cyrene whispered fiercely : " get up ! you asked for this ! " at
last it was all over, and as the enchained one was whisked away in
father scuitti's renault, candles were lit in every sartene window .

the $5,000,000 bingo parlor if prostitution is the world's oldest
profession and gambling the most profitable, what have you got when you
combine the two ? a gold mine or so south korea's ruling junta
thought when it dreamed up walker hill, a sprawling, 156-acre complex
of gaming tables and hot-pillow hotels designed to entice the tourist
trade and, not incidentally, the 40,000 u.s . troops stationed in korea
. out to manila and macao went the call for croupiers, and four
americans from las vegas moved in to manage the action . but when it
opened up ten miles outside seoul last week, the monte carlo of the
orient proved to be little more than a $5,000,000 bingo parlor with
soda fountains . the troubles for walker hill (named after the late u.s
. general walton walker, who commanded u.n . forces during the korean
war) began when its architects, who had never designed a hotel,
positioned bungalows so artistically and precariously on the hillsides
that a good rainfall threatened to slide them majestically into the han
river ; the management is now frantically planting trees to stop mud
slides . then public funds appropriated for the project mysteriously
started turning up in private pockets ; eight top walker hill
officials are currently under arrest or investigation for embezzlement
and bribery . so bad was walker hill's credit rating that louis ( "
satchmo " ) armstrong, whose band got $60,000 for playing the opening
two-week stand, " didn't even think of making plane reservations to
come here until our fee cleared the bank back home . " the worst blow,
however, came when g.i.s' mothers back in the u.s . heard about the
affair . fear that the u.s . army would declare the place off limits
forced project officials to ban gambling, except for bingo and slot
machines . as for girls, potential hustlers were told to peddle their
wares elsewhere, though one walker hill official admitted that, " while
we do not allow prostitution, we are not going to insist on couples
producing a marriage license . " there was a mad rush to get the place
ready for last week's gala opening, and guests were somewhat surprised
to find that the showers worked, sheets were on the beds, and the roast
beef in the dining room was not bad at all . but without its two major
attractions, walker hill, in all its motel modrun splendor, was still
half empty . because of the junta's slogan, " austerity for progress, "
south koreans were not allowed inside unless they came as guests of
foreigners . this policy might have to be changed . as one observer put
it : " if the government wants to make a go of this place, they'll
have to let the south koreans in and probably the north koreans too . "

central africa colonialism in reverse most british colonial
governors ultimately reach the point where they stand by, erect and
proud, as the union jack flutters down over some distant possession and
the flag of independence is run up . as the new session of parliament
began in salisbury, southern rhodesia, last week, the pattern of noble
withdrawal was broken by lord dalhousie, governor-general of the nearly
extinct central african federation . required by tradition to read the
speech drafted by the local white government, lord dalhousie,
resplendent in a plumed cocked hat and silver epaulets, delivered a
sharp rebuke to britain because it " has betrayed the people of the
federation and has done them irreparable harm . " as if to rub the
british governor-general in the federation's plight, burly federation
prime minister sir roy welensky then rose to rail at britain's "
unparalleled treachery and deceit . " chin out, fists clenched, his
voice trembling with anger, welensky cried, " the interests of the
white man and the ordinary moderate african in his thousands are being
sacrificed in a long-drawn-out act of appeasement which puts munich in
the shade ! " he charged that britain intends the continent as a
whole to " be handed over to racialism, whether the cost be a congo or
an algiers . " what infuriated welensky was that britain has already
agreed to give independence to the two black-controlled states of
northern rhodesia and nyasaland, while reserving decision on southern
rhodesia (where 250,000 whites currently rule 4,000,000 blacks) until
an african conference is held this summer . in reply, southern
rhodesia's prime minister winston field repeated his refusal to attend
any such conference until he receives in writing from britain's deputy
prime minister r . a . butler a promise that southern rhodesia gets its
independence concurrently with either of the other two states . rab
butler's answer last week was that the conference settling the details
of the dissolution of the federation must be held first, which makes
the situation like so many in africa appear insoluble . fleeing a
police rap, southern rhodesia's black nationalist joshua nkomo showed
up in tanganyika to declare his determination to fight the whole idea
of southern rhodesia independence under white rule . viewing the
deadlock, britain's spectator commented : " what now exists in
southern rhodesia is a colonial situation in reverse, " that is, the
africans themselves earnestly hope britain will retain what power it
has, while the white settlers are demanding instant freedom .

1956 morocco has been struggling to annex " the stolen sands of
mauritania, " which it claims were illegally taken from colonial
morocco by french army surveyors the late king mohammed v, a " moroccan
liberation army " even tried to " free " mauritania ; with support
from russia, morocco managed to keep the new nation out of the u.n .
for a whole year . defying morocco, mauritania's sorbonne-educated
premier moktar ould daddah, 38, has argued all along that there is no
historical basis for union, and that the two countries have neither
language nor ethnic origins in common . one by one, the former french
colonies that backed morocco's claims have all dropped out of the
battle . algeria's militant ahmed ben bella allowed recently that
mauritania's nationhood is a " reality . " last week even neighboring
mali, which also claimed part of mauritania and permitted pro-moroccan
guerrillas to raid the desert nation a year ago, finally buried the
hatchet . with royalties beginning to flow into his treasury from big,
western-financed iron-ore mines, ould daddah cut off the $4,000,000
annual subsidy his government has been getting from france, thus
effectively answering african taunts that he is a " valet of the french
. " however, even though there turned out to be gold (and iron) in
mauritania's sands, it has become increasingly plain that morocco's
pragmatic young king hassan ii does not share his father's fervent
faith in a " greater morocco " and realizes, in any case, that its big
neighbor is here to stay . moreover, the king now has sufficient
political strength to resist pressure from the nationalist istiqlal
party, most dogged advocate of mauritania's annexation . last week, he
decided to repatriate four prominent mauritanian exiles who had been
leading the campaign against their country from morocco for several
years . in may, when africa's leaders meet for a " summit " conference
at addis ababa, hassan is expected to make morocco's new policy
official .

laos beckoning the undertaker " the clouds are still hanging in
the air and the weather looks bad, " said a diplomat in vientiane last
week . his gloomy forecast was prompted not by the upcoming rainy
season, but by the festering, communist-induced political crisis that
is slowly turning " neutral " laos into a red satellite . for months on
the plaine des jarres, headquarters of both the neutralist and
communist pathet lao armies, the reds have been slowly squeezing their
former neutralist allies in an effort to drive them off the grassy
plateau . defying last summer's 14-nation geneva accords guaranteeing
laotian neutrality, the pathet lao is still reinforced by communist
viet minh cadres from north viet nam ; to the north of the plaine des
jarres, red chinese troops are building roads linking china with
red-controlled laos itself . slowly the communists have been pinching
off supplies to neutralist army leader general kong le and bribing his
officers to defect . last week, with kong le's food and ammunition
rations down to the two-day level, the reds, in a blaze of gunfire,
sliced off another chunk of neutralist territory at xiengkhouang, just
south of the plateau . " foreign lackeys . " trouble began when the
pathet lao, supported by the viet minh, opened fire on a group of kong
le's soldiers fishing in their off-duty hours near the town of khang
khay . then the reds advanced on the neutralist stronghold at
xiengkhouang, and launched a mortar barrage that forced kong le's
forces out of the town . with full-scale civil war threatening to break
out on the plaine des jarres, kong le evacuated the wives and children
of his men to the laotian capital of vientiane, 120 miles away . as the
bedraggled neutralist forces tried to fight their way back to the
plateau from xiengkhouang, the reds attacked once more with artillery
and bazookas, inflicting heavy losses on kong le's troops . the
treacherous red attacks completed the political transformation of kong
le, who once was the darling of moscow and peking . two and a half
years ago, kong le had joined forces with the pathet lao on the plaine
des jarres and with them demanded the withdrawal of all the western
troops in laos . but consistently neutralist, kong le today is as
bitterly opposed to viet minh intervention in laos as he had been to
the presence of u.s . military advisers last october . fortnight ago he
raged that the viet minh were " foreign lackeys " who hoped to make
laos their base to spread their evil policies thoughout southeast asia
. heart in france . last week kong le was desperately urging his old
right-wing foes to send troops to his aid on the plaine des jarres .
but ineffectual neutralist premier souvanna phouma feared that any such
determined action might unglue his tottering left-right-center
coalition . souvanna could not even keep order in vientiane, where last
week another top neutralist the second in a fortnight was gunned down
in his own house . " i don't know which foot to dance on, " said
souvanna plaintively . " i wish i was on the seashore in france with my
family . " at week's end, after the reds had consolidated their hold on
xiengkhouang, the international control commission of canada, poland
and india, which had been set up by the geneva conference to police
laotian neutrality, finally got approval from the pathet lao to fly
into the plaine des jarres on a peacemaking mission . meanwhile the
u.s., shuddering at the prospect of another massive military commitment
in southeast asia, was hopeful that the onset of the rainy season would
stall off major hostilities . the most that optimistic u.s . officials
could hope for in laos was a continued stalemate ; realists felt,
however, that an eventual communist takeover was only a matter of time
. " asking what you can do sensibly about laos is like asking a patient
close to death to come in every two months to see what his doctor can
do for him, " said one ranking u.s . insider . " after a while, there
is nothing you can do but call the undertaker . /

laos a new civil war ? just nine months after the
14-nation geneva conference guaranteed laotian neutrality, laos last
week tottered on the brink of civil war and once again threatened to
drag the major powers into a bitter struggle . for three weeks, the red
forces, reinforced by cadres of viet minh troop commanders, mortar
specialists and artillery advisers from communist north viet nam, had
been nibbling away at neutralist positions around the 30-mile perimeter
of the grassy, pool-table-flat plaine des jarres . strategically placed
in the center of laos, the plain named after the ancient stone burial
jars still found in the area controls the approaches to the rest of the
country and is the primary access route to north viet nam . with the
plaine des jarres in their hands, the reds could solidify their hold on
all of northern laos . last week this gloomy prospect was all but a
fact, as 10,000 red troops poured onto the plain, forcing the
neutralists to its very edge . cigarettes & bullets . the week began
with a desperate flight to the plain by neutralist premier souvanna
phouma, who hoped it still might be possible to arrange a cease-fire
between the communist pathet lao and neutralist army chief kong le .
things seemed cheery enough as the opposing leaders embraced and their
troops exchanged cigarettes . but, as one neutralist put it, " we
exchange cigarettes during the day and bullets at night . " all too
true . hardly had souvanna departed when the truce abruptly collapsed .
no one knows who fired first, but all of a sudden the pathet lao was
shooting, and the neutralists were running . on the dusty plaine des
jarres airstrip, mothers breastfed dirty babies, and children sagged
under the weight of parachute packs crammed with household belongings
as they patiently waited for planes to evacuate them to the laotian
capital of vientiane, 120 miles away . in his ramshackle, tin-roofed
headquarters, guarded night and day by a patrolling platoon of tanks,
kong le worked round the clock drawing up a battle plan, although
weakened by a liver ailment and a serious sinus condition . " this, "
he said, " is the final showdown . " moving over the mountaintops and
through the passes girdling the plain, the reds at last surrounded the
six-mile-long plateau . from the heights, the communists laid a mortar
barrage on the airfield, kong le's last remaining lifeline to vientiane
. with the airstrip inoperable, kong le was forced to rely on runners
as his primary means of communication ; he had no choice but to pull
together what was left of his shattered forces and move off the plain .
pressure from two quarters . kong le's retreat caused consternation in
vientiane . with his left-right-center coalition fast coming unstuck,
premier souvanna phouma was fearful that kong le's troops would join
forces with a right-wing army just southwest of the plaine des jarres
and launch a joint counterattack against the reds that would surely
precipitate civil war . desperately he appealed to britain and russia,
overseers of the geneva agreement, for quick intervention to stop the
pathet lao's flagrant violations of the cease-fire . russia hesitated
to intercede, for fear of alienating the communists in laos and north
viet nam . soviet intervention at this stage might turn them
increasingly toward red china, russia's rival, for support in their
revolution . but nikita khrushchev was also under pressure from a
different quarter . in washington, president kennedy made it clear that
he expected moscow to put a stop to pathet lao pressure and live up to
the geneva agreement . " we will, i think, have a chance to see in the
next few days whether we are going to have a destruction of that accord
whether the soviet union and other signatories are going to meet their
obligations, " said kennedy . tougher u.s . action could not be ruled
out if the communists showed signs of moving south from the plaine des
jarres into the mekong river valley itself . this would strengthen
their supply routes to communist guerrillas fighting in neighboring
south viet nam, where the u.s . is deeply committed with both men and
money . though the state department dreaded the thought of any further
military involvement in southeast asia, officials made it clear that
more troops might be brought into the area to safeguard laotian
neutrality .

south viet nam the great emancipator for more than a year, the
u.s . has been urging south viet nam's president ngo dinh diem to
declare a general amnesty for communist viet cong guerrillas in order
to encourage wholesale desertions from the red cause . diem was in
favor of the idea . but he always replied that as abraham lincoln
waited two years after the beginning of the civil war before issuing
his emancipation proclamation, he, too, would wait for a propitious
moment so that the move could not be interpreted as a desperate gesture
by a sinking government to round up popular support . last week,
confident that the war against the reds had taken a turn for the
better, diem finally proclaimed an " open arms " clemency program .
diem's declaration was speeded by the encouraging results of an
informal government clemency program in effect since february that has
caused the defection of more than 2,700 viet cong followers, including
several minor red officials . under the terms of the new proclamation,
red defectors " will be given the opportunity to reform and redeem
themselves by deeds, and depending on these deeds, will be entitled to
lighter sentences or be absolved of past offenses . " but the offer of
amnesty applies only to viet cong sympathizers and not to hard-core
communist cadres, who, diem feels, are incapable of rehabilitation .
diem's announcement came on the first anniversary of the start of his
government's strategic hamlet program, under which 59 per cent of the
south vietnamese people have been brought into villages surrounded by
moats and bamboo fences . as if in celebration of the event, government
forces beat back a violent viet cong attack against a network of
villages around the city of quangngai, some 250 miles northeast of
saigon, where the government set up a successful fortified village
complex in an area that the reds had previously controlled . departing
from the usual communist hit-and-run tactics, a battalion of reds
attacked the hamlets under cover of darkness, drove to the edge of the
u.s . military compound in the city with a grenade assault before being
driven back . " it took two days for the government forces to stamp out
the fire, " said one u.s . official . " after that, they managed to
gain the initiative, and that's what they're keeping . /

italy fanfani's test along the grand canal in venice, a huge,
brightly lit red-and-white shield of the christian democratic party
gleams in the night ; sprouting from rome's janiculum hill,
overlooking the vatican, is the red-white-green flame of the tiny,
powerless fascists . from messina to milan last week, wide piazzas and
narrow alleyways sprouted in riotous campaign colors, and echoed with
the loudspeaker slogans of scudding little fiat 600s, as italy's
34,300,000 voters prepared to go to the polls for the first national
election in five years . the election is the most important since 1948,
when the communists were defeated in a crucial bid for power . the
threat of a red takeover has long since faded ; this time the main
issue is continuation of the apertura a sinistra (opening to the left),
premier amintore fanfani's year-old experiment in parliamentary
cooperation with the left-wing socialists . mixed blessing . the deal
has given fanfani the necessary majority to introduce a long list of
economic and social reforms ; it also provides the opportunity for
isolating the reds by finally breaking their hold on pietro nenni's
socialists . but the apertura also opens the way to far-reaching
government planning and higher taxes, both of which are strongly
opposed by large and small businessmen ; perhaps significantly,
liberal party leader giovanni malagodi, an economic conservative who
sharply criticizes fanfani's flirtation with the left, has been drawing
large and enthusiastic crowds . another anxiety created by the
center-left coalition is that neutralist nenni will weaken italy's
ties to the atlantic alliance . these fears could cost fanfani's
christian democrats as many as 1,000,000 votes . as always, the vatican
is a hot campaign issue ; this time, pope john has made it hotter than
usual by meeting aleksei adzhubei, nikita khrushchev's son-in-law, last
month, and otherwise establishing friendlier relations with the kremlin
. fortnight ago, the communist newspaper l'unita exaggerated pope
john's recent pacem in terris encyclical as an " an appeal for peace
based on nuclear disarmament . " this prompted a progovernment
newspaper to crack that the reds were suddenly " more papist than the
pope . " in fact, the vatican is quietly backing fanfani's christian
democratic-socialist partnership, though publicly it has steered a
neutral course ; this time, for example, parish priests are not saying
that to vote for the socialists is a grave sin . useful visit . another
john who casts his shadow over the campaign is john f . kennedy . the
u.s . has smoothly shifted its support away from christian democratic
right-wingers who would like to close the apertura, now favors
fanfani's coalition . one group of fanfani supporters is dubbed the "
kennediani, " and the premier, dashing about the countryside in a black
lancia, repeatedly recalls for townsfolk his recent visit to washington
as evidence of italy's high standing with the u.s . for campaign
purposes even fanfani's socialist allies have been warming to the u.s .
asked a socialist speaker, confident of an affirmative answer from a
crowd in bologna's piazza matteotti : " if kennedy were in italy,
would he not support the opening to the left ? " perhaps he would .
more to the point : will the italians ? as the voters head for the
polls this week, prevailing opinion was that they would .

france encore, non in a 20-minute tv speech last week, charles

conference at which he barred britain from europe . as the baroque
paragraphs unfolded, it became plain that france's president had not
retreated from the policies that have divided the western alliance and
halted the integration of europe in the three months since . his views
on key issues . . .europe . political integration of europe would "
inevitably end in foreign domination " of the continent . it would, in
any case, be " incompatible with the rights and duties of the french
republic " to surrender sovereignty to a supranational parliament,
which de gaulle disdainfully liked to an " areopagus, " the supreme
court of ancient athens . " in short, it seems to us essential that
europe should be europe and france, france . " . england . with all due
respect to " the great english people, " de gaulle firmly insisted that
/ union " of europe, meaning apparently the gaullist proposal for
closer ties between governments, cannot wait for britain . " one day,
perhaps, " england will be admitted to europe after it has " detached
itself " from its ties with the commonwealth and the u.s . .the western
alliance . the alliance is " indispensable so long as the threats and
ambitions of the soviets continue . " while " conjugating " its defense
with nato, however, france " intends to remain its own master . "
.nuclear independence . france's force de frappe is essential to "
dissuade " wouldbe aggressors and " contribute to the defense of its
allies, including who knows ? america . " for though the americans "
are our good allies, as we are theirs, " in the event of nuclear war
there is " immense and inevitable uncertainty " whether russia and the
u.s . would use nuclear weapons at all, or only in europe, or whether
the two " champions " might not " hurl death reciprocally into each
others' vitals . " critics who say france's deterrent is useless or too
expensive are in " the same category of laggards and scatterbrains who
cried, " no heavy artillery' until 1914, " and before 1939 " cried, "
no armored corps ! no fighter aircraft ! " ' as journalists like to
say, there wasn't very much that was " new " in the speech . but there

west germany an eclipse of princes when britain's prince
philip and his daughter, princess anne, 12, clambered out of their
raspberry-pink royal plane at frankfurt last week, there were no
tophatted officials to welcome them or respectful crowds cheering " es
lebe hoch .! " after greeting their waiting cousins, prince ludwig
and princess margaret von hessen, philip and anne got quickly into the
rakish alvis sports coupe, which had been flown ahead of the royal
party from london . then they headed down the autobahn to darmstadt,
where they stayed at the von hessens' palatial 18th century schloss
wolfsgarten . the british visitors' four-day stay made little stir in
west germany as a whole, but their presence worked like champagne on
the aristocracy's battered morale . in a society where most bluebloods
feel that they are displaced personages (there hasn't been a kaiser
since 1918), the romantik of a royal visit is rare indeed . thanks to
the nation's miraculous economic boom, west germans today are more
concerned with paychecks than with princely comings and goings . but
the country's economic and social transformation has failed notably to
produce a unified, national fuhrungsschicht (leadership layer) in place
of the old aristocratic ruling caste . the result is a confused and
confusing society in which, says sociologist ralf dahrendorf, there is
not one class of prominenz but " a multitude of competing groups . "
the " pyramids of power " include the church, the military, local
government and such venerable universities as tubingen, gottingen and
heidelberg, where a herr professor commands undiminished respect from
the community at large . salon from ford ? by far the most powerful
and conspicuous elite in present-day germany is, of course, the
geldaristokratie, the new industrial plutocracy whose yellow mercedeses
and chris-craft cruisers have largely replaced the iron cross and the
dueling scar as status symbols . the new upper crust is personified by
such tycoons as rudolf august oetker, who parlayed a baking powder
business into a 100-company empire ; hans gunther sohl, who as boss of
thyssen since war's end has turned a family ironworks into west
germany's biggest steelmaker ; and munich's rudolf munemann, one of
the nation's biggest and boldest financiers . yet, for all its wealth,
says sociologist dahrendorf, the geldaristokratie " is searching above
itself in the social hierarchy for its behavioral standards . but the
space above it is empty . " this, he suggests, accounts for the
joyless, frantic materialism that characterizes much of postwar german
life " the medieval choir stall in the dining room, the conspicuous
consumption, the complete lack of taste in art and literature . "
complains one sophisticated young princess : " if the ford foundation
really wants to do something for germany, it should endow a salon in
bonn . just a little salon . the old society is dead now . " vons in
volkswagens . like the last great auks waddling across the tundra, a
few ancient families still survive in the feudal splendor they enjoyed
when germany was a patchwork of petty principalities . in franconia,
convivial count franz erbach presides over three family castles (one is
kept for hunting parties) ; at dinner, his liveried chief huntsman
stations himself behind the count's chair to summon a footman whenever
his master's wineglass is empty . prince emich zu leiningen, 36, whose
escutcheon is at least 880 years old, is a globe-trotting big-game
hunter who honed his marksmanship as a youth by taking potshots at
family portraits in his handsome baroque palace at amorbach . many old
bavarian families stubbornly resisted the nazis and were singled out
for persecution by hitler ; after the war, they were able to reclaim
their confiscated holdings intact, and ever since have managed to keep
the boar from the door with conspicuous success . one of their
liveliest members is handsome prince " alfie " auersperg, who was down
to his last schloss a few years ago ; today he boasts a priceless
collection of french paintings and a u.s . heiress for a wife . because
the bavarian aristocrats have traditionally been less exclusive than
prussia's patricians, munich today is one city in which the rival
elites come together . munich's jet set, composed of the nouveau riche
and the ancient upper crust, shuttles between st . moritz and egypt's
resort of helwan . its reigning beauty is the statuesque blonde
daughter of banker munemann, " antschi, " who hurtles around town in an
eggshell-colored ferrari ; however, many families with " von " in
their names still prefer to drive volkswagens . " everything, " sighs a
jet-set princess, " is so mixed up these days . /
top ten thousand . scores of
young bluebloods have gone to work and often belie the aristocracy's
traditional reputation for stupidity . the boards of big industrial
companies are liberally studded with noble names . the names are
particularly in demand as public relations men . " i do like snobs, "
exclaims one princely p.r . man . " they are all so kind to one ! "
two of west germany's ablest journalists are titled : countess marion
donhoff, political editor of hamburg's weekly die zeit, and count hans
werner finck von finckenstein, a correspondent for die welt . says one
corporate count : " all you need to get ahead in industry is
reasonably good looks, self-assurance and organizational talent . this
the nobility had, and now the young ones are all fat people in their
firms . " germany's nobility was largely to blame for its own decline .
holding themselves aloof from politics, business and the intellectual
world, die oberen zehntausend (the top ten thousand), as bismarck
called the elite, devoted their lives either to hunting or to the army
; when hindenburg joined the cadet corps in 1859, 2,000 of 2,900
prussian officers were of nobel birth . however, in its emphasis on a "
citizens' army, " west germany's government has even closed off this
time-honored avenue for " aristocratic service . " as far back as 1826,
the year that cannon king friedrich krupp died, goethe bewailed a new "
century of able men, " protesting : " it is riches and speed that the
world admires and strives for . " the first krupp and the other new
tycoons were essential to the kaisers' dreams of empire ; the
aristocratic clans that accepted them won new wealth and a new lease on
life . finally decimated by two world wars, denigrated by hitler's
funktionarsgesellschaft (society of functionaries), their eclipse was
sealed by the postwar partition of germany . worst hit of all were the
wealthy junkers, the brahmins of teutonic society, who lost their vast
tracts of land in the eastern territories and in most cases came to
west germany as penniless refugees . company cousins . even today many
older aristocrats regard a business career as not quite salonfahig
(socially desirable) . at a dinner party in bonn last week, a
bespectacled count drew sympathetic clucks when he declared : " all my
young cousins are in industry now . incredible ! " another aristocrat
harrumphed recently : " the great problem in germany today is that
there are no gentlemen in the government . " it is to west germany's
credit nonetheless that nowadays talents are apt to count for more than
titles . " how do you get ahead today ? " asks a grey-templed
industrialist . " it's easy proficiency and elbows . " this new,
assertive sense of self-confidence has penetrated to every level of
german society . instead of accepting the old class divisions as
preordained, says sociologist helmut schelsky, german workers today
believe almost religiously in the slogan : " ich kann das auch werden
(i can get to be what he is) . " thus, despite the laments of the
aristocracy, argues schelsky, the end of the old order may prove to be
a blessing after all . " if you want democracy, " says he, " you can't
complain about the leveling and atomization of society . i'm pretty
optimistic about the future . /

great britain aldermaston's amen ? since 1958, when the
campaign for nuclear disarmament staged the first aldermaston march,
its 52-mile easter parade has turned into britain's biggest lunatic
fringe benefit . beardies and weirdies soon stole the spotlight from
the pacifist parsons and left-wing laborites who started the
ban-the-bomb movement . it also became evident that the four-day
shuffle was being manipulated by such highly motivated " pilgrims " as
communist agitators, anarchists, and a few thugs to boot . last week,
after the sixth annual spectacular ended in blisters and bombast in
hyde park, most responsible britons including several c.n.d .
co-founders were more eager to ban the march than the bomb . their
disillusionment was the result of a stratagem that struck even the
tolerant british as a disloyal act . even before the marchers left
aldermaston, there appeared copies of a crudely mimeographed,
twelvepage document headed : danger ! official secret . inside, its
anonymous authors declared : " we are spies for peace . we have
decided to publish an official secret . there are thousands more
secrets in captivity . this is not the only one we shall release . "
the information it contained was, in fact, highly classified : the
locations, code names and telephone numbers of twelve regional seats of
government from which british authorities would attempt to restore
order in the event of nuclear attack . " this, " exclaimed home
secretary henry brooke, " is the work of a traitor . " by no
coincidence, the only emergency headquarters described in detail was
r.s.g . 6, an underground bunker in the berkshire woods along the
marchers' route from reading to london . ignoring c.n.d . officials'
pleas to stay on the main road, 1,000 of some 15,000 marchers left the
procession and poured down the country lane marked on the " peace "
spies' map . after a scuffle with police, the shouting demonstrators
staged a mass squat around the bunker for more than an hour, until one
of their leaders announced : " we have achieved our object . "
whatever their real object, the " spies for peace " triggered a
full-scale scotland yard investigation and brought prime minister
harold macmillan scurrying back from his country home to london for
consultation with his cabinet . nevertheless, canon john collins, c.n.d
. chairman and preceptor of st . paul's cathedral, simpered on tv that
most marchers " treated it rather as a joke . " his merriment was not
shared by james cameron, a crusading journalist who has been a
prominent figure in c.n.d . since its inception . cameron conceded
sadly that the ban-the-bomb marches had become a vehicle for too many
secondary and dubious intentions . " admitting belatedly that c.n.d .
had been taken for a ride, cameron cried : " god save us from our

spain trouble this summer ? one day last week, three
impatient shrieks of a locomotive whistle shattered the morning calm of
sanlucar de barrameda, a small spanish city in the grape country around
cadiz . on the dusty railroad platform, the stationmaster nervously
paced back and forth waiting for the expected passengers, seasonal
workers who commute to their jobs in the vineyards . but scarcely a
soul showed up at the station, for in sanlucar and nearby jerez de la
frontera 3,900 workers were out on strike for a $2.50 daily wage (a 50
#$ boost), portal-to-portal pay between the vineyard and home, and two
not one daily cigars, the slang word for the workers' traditional
20-minute siesta . the strike was the latest and biggest in a wave of
labor unrest that has swept dictator francisco franco's spain this
spring . in barcelona the hispano suiza airplane-engine plant recently
laid off 150 employees following a series of work slowdowns, was forced
to hire them back when 2,000 olivetti factory employees threatened a
sympathy walkout . two sitdown strikes in a single week disrupted work
in a seville textile plant . six hundred madrid metalworkers have been
threatening similar trouble after stubbornly refusing to sign a new
contract . aid from the priests . the complaints are many, for the
spanish worker puts in longer hours for less pay than almost any other
worker in western europe, and strikes are legally banned . when el
caudillo granted substantial wage boosts for the 60,000 striking
asturias coal miners last summer, he merely whetted the appetites of
workers in the rest of the country ; another increase last jan . 1,
raising unskilled laborers from a minimum 60 #$ to $1 per day, did not
help the millions of skilled workers above this meager floor . openly
backing the latest wave of strikes are the priests of the workers'
brotherhoods of catholic action and several small but effective
catholic lay organizations that regularly blast the caudillo's tight
controls on workers from beneath the sheltering wing of the church .
one such group, the young christian workers, publishes an uncensored
and outspoken monthly bulletin, juventud obrera, that demands free,
western-style labor unions, lashes out at the anachronistic sindicatos,
which fix prices and wages throughout the country . said journal editor
francisco guerrero, 25, describing his mission last week : " our work
is god's answer to the evil negation of all human values . it is the
only salvation for spain's masses, oppressed from above (by franco) and
menaced from below (by the communists) . " a trip to cadiz . such frank
talk has the regime seriously worried, and a few of the more
progressive members of franco's authoritarian regime are anxiously
trying to improve labor conditions . the labor ministry is preparing a
bill to legalize " labor " strikes (as distinct from " political "
strikes) . another measure of the regime's concern was the swift

death at dawn julian grimau garcia was 25 and a detective in
madrid when the spanish civil war broke out in 1936 . but he was also a
member of the spanish communist party, and his professional police
training soon landed him a key job in the red apparatus . he became
chief of " criminal investigations " for madrid, valencia and
barcelona, ferreting out supporters of francisco franco . part of
grimau's job was to serve on kangaroo courts, called chekas (after the
onetime initials of the soviet secret police), which ordered dozens of
summary death sentences during the brutal three-year war . after the
republican collapse grimau fled, worked as a communist agent in
czechoslovakia, russia, mexico and cuba . a member of the central
committee of the outlawed spanish communist party, he was living in
france when he slipped across the frontier in 1959 to reorganize the
spanish communist underground . after several trips in and out of spain
since 1959, an informer gave him away to police in madrid last november
. franco's cops clapped him in jail and began a lengthy interrogation .
during one session, grimau leaped, fell, or was pushed from a
first-floor window, fracturing his skull and both arms . last week,
with a large dent in his forehead, gaunt, balding grimau heard a
seven-man military court tick off the charges against him ; they
ranged from " continuing military rebellion " to arson, torture and
execution of anti-republicans by the chekas 25 years ago . the maximum
penalty was death . did he care to say something before sentence was
passed only this, " replied grimau . " since 1936, i have lived the
life of a communist . i will die a communist . " then he took his seat
and listened intently as the court pronounced the sentence everyone
expected death . this was the cue for communist demonstrations in half
a dozen west european cities ; nikita khrushchev, no stranger to
executions, had the gall to send a personal appeal for clemency to
franco . grimau's wife vainly urged president kennedy to intervene .
the international pressure only stiffened the regime's determination to
carry out the penalty . at a meeting with his cabinet, franco upheld
the sentence . next day at dawn, grimau, pale but composed, was led
into the courtyard of carabanchel prison just outside madrid . he
walked alone to the wall, refused a blindfold, shouted " viva el
communismo " , and then collapsed under a volley of shots fired by
spanish moroccan troops .

ghana dealing with enemies during his six years as ghana's boss,
president kwame nkrumah has dealt with his opposition in a variety of
ways intimidation, jail, exile . last week he went a step further . in
a packed courtroom in accra, where mine detectors were used to check
spectators for weapons, an nkrumah-created tribunal passed out death
sentences to five enemies of the regime . the five men, four ghanaians
and a nigerian, were charged with treason in connection with half a
dozen explosions that killed 35 persons and injured 300 . the bombing
began last august, when the blast of a hand grenade wounded osagyefo in
the shoulder as he drove by in his russian-made chaika limousine near
the northern border village of kulungugu . nkrumah's cops have been
rounding up suspects ever since . as the five-week trial dragged on,
one of the defendants, nigerian immigrant malam mama tula, 44,
testified that the real brains behind the kulungugu attempt were three
men who had been nkrumah's closest cronies, ex-foreign minister ako
adjei, ex-information minister tawia adamafio, and h . h .
cofie-crabbe, former executive secretary of nkrumah's own convention
people's party . mama tula said that the trio conferred with the bomb
throwers at a village hideout, supplied eight british-made grenades and
promised a $560 bounty if nkrumah was killed . the three have been in
prison under the preventive detention act since last august . one of
the four other treason defendants beside mama tula in the dock, teiko
tagoe, 20, readily admitted to possession of a live hand grenade at a
meeting of nkrumah's party last january . another, joseph quaye mensah,
57, owned up to mailing the redeemer an anonymous letter warning, "
dear dr., this is to inform you i am still chasing you until i . . .
have you killed, " but pleaded that he was only trying to scare nkrumah
. when the testimony ended, the three wihite-wigged judges filed out,
spent another two weeks preparing a 6,000-word decision they returned
last week, the chief justice paused somberly to don a black cap before
pronouncing sentence, signal that the verdict would be death by hanging

the katanga town of jadotville, their love affair resulted in a savage
orgy of killing unlike any ever seen on the streets of verona . bands
of lunda natives, armed with knives, machetes, and razor-sharp bicycle
chains lashed to sticks, stormed through the streets looking for baluba
youths wearing monkey fur headpieces and animal-skin war dresses . both
sides chased terrified police out of native quarters, brushed aside the
pleas of katanga's president moise tshombe when he arrived in the city
begging for the carnage to stop . as the slaughter raged unchecked,
white children were evacuated from the city to a nearby methodist
mission . from neighboring northern rhodesia, blood was flown in to
meet the needs of the jadotville hospital, where doctors and nurses
worked nonstop for more than 48 hours trying to patch up a steady
stream of wounded and dying . many victims were maimed beyond
recognition . " a doctor lifted a bandage off one man's head, " said a
witness . " a large piece had been sliced out of his skull like a slice
from an orange, and i could see his brain pulsating . " after four days
of bloodshed, the rioting finally petered out, and cautious united

they're off only six weeks ago, most british politicians
believed that prime minister harold macmillan's government would not
dare call a general election before spring 1964 . but in westminster
last week m.p.s were wagering that the tories would go to the people
this fall . labor party leaders even claimed to know the date : oct .
24, about the last possible thursday (britain's traditional polling
day) before the end of campaigning season . reason for the shift in
thinking was the good economic news for the government that came with
spring's thaw after the worst winter of the century . suddenly came
word of new export records, booming retail sales and swelling company
profits . most welcome news of all last week was that the remorseless
five-month rise in unemployment had finally drifted down to 604,000,
off nearly 100,000 from the march figure . promises & threats . the
tories still faced a long, hazardous haul . politically and
economically, the biggest roadblock is that industry will not be able
to expand and compete in world markets without vigorous, unpopular
measures to hold wage boosts to half their rate of increase over the
past decade . on the bright side, economists now believe that, by fall,
chancellor of the exchequer reginald maudling's canny budget (time,
april 12) will have boosted production, whittled unemployment and put
extra spending money in lower-income pockets . in fact, many tory m.p.s
now fear that if the government waits until next year before calling
the election, it may lose its gains in another winter slump and have
even less time for recovery before its fiveyear mandate expires in
october 1964 . in any case, the campaign is already under way . prime
minister harold macmillan threw a straw in the wind by reappointing
hardheaded lord poole as cochairman of the party with leader of the
house iain macleod . poole, who raised record sums for the tories in
the 1955 and 1959 campaigns, is the reputed author of the "
never-had-it-so-good " theme that helped return the government at the
last election . grey utopia . last weekend, with poole and 32 other top
tories who were summoned to the prime minister's country home,
macmillan started drafting the party's broad, long-term program of
social and economic reform . its theme, said macmillan, will be "
modernize not nationalize . " in his fiercest attack on labor in many
months, the prime minister charged in a speech to glasgow tories that "
the socialists have nothing to offer except old threats supported by
sly promises . " the opposition, declared macmillan, still clings to
its " old-hat " view of a socialist utopia, in which " everybody is
more or less the same shade of grey . " he insisted that under labor,
britain would revert swiftly to the status of a " secondclass power . "
macmillan's final decision on the election date will be influenced by
the gallup poll percentages, which in april showed a fractional slip in
labor's massive lead, now 49.5 per cent to 34 per cent , over the
tories . other omens will be the results of three spring by-elections
necessitated by the deaths of hugh gaitskell and two other labor m.p.s
. one thing was certain : at 69, harold macmillan is still confident
that the party cannot yet dispense with his leadership . by way of
patching party morale, he has already quashed back-bench rumors that he
might step down . " i'll be leading you into the next general election,
/ he told tory m.p.s recently, " and i'll be with you in the new
parliament . /

west germany sweet success jovial and popular economics minister
ludwig erhard, after years of patiently and impatiently waiting, last
week finally got his party's promise to make him west germany's next
chancellor . even konrad adenauer had to say yes . vice chancellor
since 1957, " uncle ludwig " was the architect of the nation's postwar
prosperity and by far the christian democratic union's best vote-getter
. but chancellor adenauer, who hates to give way after 14 years in
power, and hates even more to give way to erhard, thought he could
stall off erhard's formal appointment . at a party meeting last week,
adenauer tried to talk about everything but his successor . grumpily,
adenauer declared that he could not tolerate a chancellor-designate "
looking over my shoulder " in the remaining months before his promised
fall retirement is a fact . besides, he added, " i simply don't see why
we must reach a decision now, " since there were three other candidates
for the job, and he named them : c.d.u . bundestag leader heinrich von
brentano ; adenauer's old crony, minister without portfolio heinrich
krone ; foreign minister gerhard schroder . the gambit did not work
: one after the other, to the old man's surprise, each of the three
prominent leaders rose to refuse candidacy for the nation's most
powerful office . der alte was licked, and to reporters outside, who
complained about being kept away from the meeting room, he snapped : "
how do you think i felt inside that room ? i would rather have been
outside . " next day, when the c.d.u . parliamentary caucus met to
formally ratify the choice of erhard as successor, the 87-year-old
adenauer was still burning . " i bear no personal animosity toward
professor erhard, " he said, " but my opinion is that he is not a
suitable man to be chancellor . " the caucus overwhelmingly disagreed,
voted 159 to 47 (with 19 abstentions) to name erhard, 66, the c.d.u.'s
next chancellor . for ludwig erhard, who sat chewing on a cigar
throughout the proceedings, success was too sweet for any thought of
revenge against his old foe . he pledged " to forgive and forget "
adenauer's insults . all eyes then swung to der alte, who swallowed his
bitterness, promised to abide by the majority decision . " i am
willing, " he told erhard, " to pass along to you all i know the
interests of the german people . " then he abruptly stood up, slowly
and impassively walked through the crowd to his waiting car, and with a
weary wave of farewell, drove home .

southeast asia a losing proposition the west's maneuvers to
counter the disintegration in laos last week were largely diplomatic .
in london, british foreign secretary lord home called on russia
co-administrator with britain of the geneva accords to sign a joint
appeal that the feuding forces in laos end their fighting . fearful
that such peace talk would nudge asian communist revolutionaries still
closer to rival red china and its " hard line, " russia refused, unless
the statement specifically blamed the u.s . for undermining the peace
in laos . britain vetoed the suggestion . president kennedy hustled
under secretary of state for political affairs averell harriman, who
had hammered out the basic format for the geneva agreement last summer,
to moscow to urge on khrushchev the need for russian intercession in
laos . " we regard the maintenance of the geneva accords as essential
to the security of laos itself, " said kennedy, " and as a test of
whether it is possible for an accord to be reached between countries
which have serious differences . " in moscow, harriman was received
coolly ; only a junior protocol officer was at the airport to meet him
. when he got to the kremlin, he found khrushchev more than happy to
give vague endorsement of the geneva accords, but less than willing to
take any concrete action to stop the fighting in the plain of jars.
the road builders . as the diplomats talked, the pentagon was quietly
flexing its muscles . units of the u.s . seventh fleet began cruising
in the south china sea, and though the move had been planned for
months, washington picked last week to announce that two combat-ready
battle groups would soon move into thailand to take part in next
month's full-scale seato battle maneuvers . it was reminiscent of the
crash buildup of troop strength in thailand just a year ago, when the
last serious flare-up in laos took place . left behind when these
troops were withdrawn were enough trucks, tanks and personnel carriers
to equip a third battle group that might be needed in the event of
emergency . the
plain is named for the scores of large, stone burial urns dotting the
area, in which the ancestral ashes of the laotian people were once
deposited . both the pathet lao and the neutralists avoid fighting near
the jars, for laotian tradition holds that the penalty for disturbing
them is a violent and fiery retribution from the spirits within .
apart from the combat troops, some 2,600
other u.s . military personnel chiefly engineers and signal troops are
in thailand . near the laotian border, a u.s . army construction
battalion is nearing completion of an allweather jet airstrip . at a
meeting with top u.s . aides in bangkok, admiral harry d . felt,
commander of all u.s . forces in the pacific, discussed contingency
plans in the event that the pathet lao moves off the plain of jars into
the mekong river valley . the u.s . is not committed to put troops
into laos,
and the military is not enthusiastic about the prospect of fighting
there, for the lack of airfields, railroads and good roads would make
it tough to sustain operations . but if the pathet lao showed an
inclination to sweep all the way south, the u.s . forces in thailand
might well have to move across the mekong and occupy the laotian
capital of vientiane and other strategic points in the valley .
meanwhile in laos itself, a lull had settled over the battlefield . in
a flying visit to the plain of jars, neutralist premier souvanna phouma
managed to arrange a shaky cease-fire between the pathet lao and kong
le's neutralists . though sporadic artillery duels still pockmarked the
plain, there were no outright red attacks, and the neutralists lost no
new territory . but hostilities threatened to erupt from another
quarter . around the perimeter of the plain, right-wing general phoumi
nosavan was reinforcing his positions, and in the foothills behind the
pathet lao lines, tough, well-armed meo tribesmen, who have no love for
the reds, posed a dangerous threat to communist supply routes from
north viet nam . if laos should fall to the reds, north viet nam's ho
chi minh trail (see map), the supply route which
cuts through the laotian thickets to communist viet cong guerrillas in
south viet nam, would open up, permitting the reds to pour arms and men
into that embattled land . control of laos' mekong river valley would
also give the communists a highway for subversion of neighboring
cambodia and thailand, which in turn would increase red pressure on
burma and malaya . fait accompli . for the moment, the reds appeared
content to consolidate their new territorial gains on the plain of jars
and to let the crisis cool of its own accord . if they moved off the
plain, they would surely march right into a civil war with phoumi's
rightist forces, thus inviting u.s . intervention, which they wished to
avoid at all costs . despite protests by both souvanna and the u.s.,
the pathet lao's territorial grab was a fait accompli . there were
those in the u.s . who thought the only long-range answer to the laos
problem was outright partition . already a de facto partition of laos
existed : the northern part of the country was firmly controlled by
the communists, and the rice-rich mekong river valley was in the hands
of the rightists . it was not the ideal solution for laos . but, as one
u.s . official said " there are no good solutions in laos . there
never will be . laos has always been a losing proposition . /

on the other hand nikita khrushchev's speech started off like just
one more of his exhaustive exhortations for harder work by party bosses
and factory hands . but by the time he was through, three hours later,
his rambling remarks in the kremlin's palace of the congresses had
touched off a fresh torrent of speculation about the future leadership
of the soviet union . and all because of a few vague sentences about
old age . mused the kremlin commissar : " here am i, a man of the
older generation . . . i am already 69, and everyone knows that i cannot
hold forever the positions i now hold in the party and the state . "
crystal balls . what on earth did khrushchev mean ? was he about to
resign as premier of the nation, first secretary of the communist
party, or both ? had he lost out in a back-room power struggle ? or
was he merely trying to smooth the way for a possible successor ? if
the public was baffled, so were the free world's kremlinologists, that
tight little band of experts who spend half their time reading between
pravda's lines and half peering into their crystal balls . for weeks,
the experts had been ferverishly speculating over khrushchev's possible
heir . the favorite was handsome, hard-boiled frol kozlov, 54, no . 2
man in the party, whom nikita had quietly singled out as his choice
almost four years ago (time cover, july 13, 1959) . but other experts
excitedly pointed out that kozlov was the only kremlin leader absent
from a major moscow blowout last week marking the 93rd anniversary of
lenin's birth, thus concluded that kozlov might be on the skids . on
the basis of such barely visible clues, weary kremlinologists stake
their reputations . one of the best of the bunch, britain's edward
crankshaw, inspired one theory of nikita's future with a frontpage
story in london's observer declaring that aging khrushchev might
announce his retirement " within two years " at the coming may 28
meeting of the communist party central committee . who told him ? "
well-informed soviet sources, " of course . all guesswork . it is not
easy to say who should be believed . from jeremy wolfenden, london
daily telegraph correspondent in moscow, came word that " russian
sources decisively reject the idea that mr . khrushchev will retire
either from the premiership or the secretaryship of the party . " merle
fainsod, director of harvard's russian research center, said crankshaw
/ is spinning things out rather thin . " william griffith, research
associate on communist affairs at m.i.t.'s center for international
studies, declared, " i would not say that the weight of evidence is on
crankshaw's side . " but just in case it was, griffith added : " you
can argue either way ; either khrushchev is in trouble, or he's so
secure in power that he can perfectly well afford to mention retiring .
/ one daring demonologist even suggested that nikita himself gaily was
spreading the rumors in order to rally more support . on the other
hand, wolfgang leonhard, the ex-communist who now analyzes red affairs
for west germany's die zeit, thought it was " very possible that
khrushchev will give up one of his posts, more likely the government
job . " the free-for-all was clearly getting out of hand ; somewhat
unprofessionally the guardian's polish-born soviet expert, victor

middle east sheik jackpot five times a day for the past 30
years, thin, threadbare sheik shakhbut bin sultan faced west, bowed
low, and prayed for an oil strike . his realm of abu dhabi was
desperately in need of some good luck . up and down the persian gulf,
the states of qatar, saudi arabia, kuwait and iran were rolling in oil
wealth . but year after year, abu dhabi's 25,000 sq . mi . of sand,
date palms and barren offshore islands just got hotter, more humid and
windswept than before . perpetual truce . but then allah responded to
the sheik's prayers belatedly, but in overwhelming measure . two vast
oilfields have been tapped by british drilling teams, one at murban in
the sandy interior, the other in the shallow coastal waters of the gulf
. conservative oilmen estimate abu dhabi's proven oil reserves at about
3.8 billion bbl., which at present royalty rates would return some $1.4
billion over the years . ridiculous, say other experts : on the basis
of latest discoveries, reserves may be as great as 38 billion bbl .
this has all been rather unsettling to abu dhabi, whose 15,000 bedouins
have got along for centuries on piracy, pearl fishing and intertribal
raids . in the 19th century, the swift pirate dhows were swept from the
gulf by britain, which established " a perpetual maritime truce " hence
the name trucial states, given to abu dhabi and six other sheikdoms .
pearl fishing became unprofitable when the japanese cleverly introduced
cultured pearls to the world . there was nothing left to abu dhabi but
intrigue : of the twelve predecessors of the present sheik, only three
died peacefully in their palace beds . the rest were either murdered or
violently deposed, usually by close relatives . sheik shakhbut took
over in 1928 when his uncle was assassinated, after having earlier
killed shakhbut's father who, in turn, had come to power by killing his
older brother . shakhbut is said to have ruled so long and safely only
because his own two brothers swore a solemn oath on the koran not to
murder him . bugs in the treasury . in his long years of oil-less rule,
sheik shakhbut ran his country on customs duties of $140,000 a year,
fought some desultory wars with his neighbors in sharja and dubai, and
lived quietly in his mud-walled palace on an offshore island . he
installed an air conditioner in his bedroom but seldom used it because
he disliked the noise . he also put in a flush toilet and a pump to
supply it with water ; sewage disposal was simply a pipe jutting out
from the palace wall . nearly every day, the sheik sat crosslegged in
his throne room holding a majlis, at which he listened to complaints of
citizens, while bedouin chiefs grouped around him, some holding on
their wrists the hooded falcons that were abu dhabi's only status
symbol . when the oil revenues began to flow in last year, everyone
expected great things of sheik shakhbut . but it soon developed that
what shakhbut liked to do with money was count it, not spend it . he
refused to accept checks from the oil companies, at first kept his cash
under his bed . when the bedsprings began to bulge, he had the cash
carted to a palace dungeon . it was only after rats began nibbling at
the treasure chests and insects started eating the folding money that
shakhbut reluctantly agreed to accept the principle of banking . he now
flourishes an outsize checkbook, emblazoned with the red and white flag
of abu dhabi, but he still hates to sign checks . putting off payday .
britain, which has a mother-hen relationship to the allegedly
independent trucial states, last year promoted an abu dhabi development
program calling for $70 million worth of roads, schools and public
works . sheik shakhbut, 58, accepted the plan only in
theory.businessmen dealing with the sheik have a tendency to overnight
grey hair . " he simply asks for 50 per cent in every business deal !
/ sputtered a levantine entrepreneur . shakhbut may amiably concede
that he has signed a contract for work to be done, then adds cagily, "
but i didn't say i would pay for it . " his penny pinching even extends
to abu dhabi's 470-man army : each soldier is paid personally by
shakhbut, who stalls off payday as long as possible . the sheik's mind
resembles a revolving door . since abu dhabi has virtually no water (a
glass of water costs about the same as a glass of gin), there is a
desperate need for modern equipment to distill sea water . but the
sheik has three times shifted the location of a proposed new
distillation plant and may well shift it three or 30 times more .
groaned a frustrated british engineer : " we frequently do six weeks'
work for nothing . " the british produced plans to make abu dhabi city
into a glittering modern capital that would be the pride of the persian
gulf, but as fast as engineers lay out a new boulevard, shakhbut grants
permission to a local merchant to build a store in the middle of it .
fishy freshness . in an effort to broaden the sheik's outlook, oilmen
and the british government have given him redcarpet trips to paris,
london and new york . what interested him most was the large number of
automobiles in the three cities . " keep the cars going, " he said
earnestly, thinking happily of the future consumption of abu dhabi
gasoline . new york city struck him as a " town where people are not
civilized . they live like ants or swallows in cliffs . the sun never
gets down into the streets . " he was appalled by tv westerns : " all
that shooting upsets the basis of good government ! " what delights
shakhbut is the traditional life of his people . " the thing that
pleases me most, " he says, " is hunting for bustards with our falcons
. it's tremendous to see the falcon fighting the bustard and killing it
. each falcon has its own special owner and refuses to hunt for anyone
else . " the sheik is also a connoisseur of camel's milk his only drink
and can tell by the milk's taste what the camel has been eating and
where it was in the desert for the best milk, he explains, we feed
camels
on sea mangrove and dried fish . this gives the milk a slightly fishy
freshness we appreciate . " shakhbut once owned a cadillac, but when it
finally broke down he just abandoned it . now he makes his state visits
in a bone-jarring land-rover, but without enthusiasm . " i did all my
traveling by camel in the old days, " he sighs, " but now i have to go
by car because if the ruler went by camel, people would think it
peculiar . /

communist boss palmiro togliatti, the reds have always taken care to
balance their ideology against the fact that italy is a catholic nation
. at one time they backed the monarchy ; nowadays they even favor the
capitalist common market . as a nation, italy is less than a century
old ; first under the monarchy, then through the long night of
fascism, the country has had little time to accustom itself to
democracy . thus, to many italians, communism or at least their brand
of it does not appear the fearful specter that it does in many other
lands . in part, the communist showing was due to red defections from
pietro nenni's sharply divided socialists, the leftwing crowd that had
thrown its lot with fanfani . and in part it was due to pope john
xxiii, who had given a modicum of approval to the far left with his
pacem in terris encyclical, and with his warm welcome to the vatican
last march for nikita khrushchev's visiting son-in-law, aleksei
adzhubei . new low . from the right, apertura's chief challenge was
among the free-enterprising liberals, who more than doubled their
previous vote of 1,000,000 ; this was a spectacular gain, even if it
amounted to only 7 per cent of the total turnout . most of the credit
went to tireless liberal campaigner giovanni malagodi, 58, a banker
turned politician, who hit out hard at fanfani's schemes for more
government planning and higher taxes . it was fanfani's own christian
democrats who took the worst drubbing of all . the party had no trouble
remaining in first place with 11.7 million ballots, but on a percentage
basis it sank to the lowest share of the total vote (about 38 per cent

dissension and " incessant clamor had the effect of driving away voters

messaggero's advice to stop squabbling went unheeded . last week
right-wing christian democrats, who opposed the apertura in the first
place, seized the election results as a signal to demand that fanfani
step aside as premier in the new government probably to be formed this

europe a jolly nice chap at first meeting, few would have
guessed that giuseppe martelli's line of work was tracing the
trajectories of strongly accelerated nuclear particles . taller (6 ft .
1 in.) and handsomer than most of his scientific colleagues, martelli,
39, spoke fluent russian and english, and could even make a certain
amount of small talk . son of a world war i italian general, he had
studied at the university of rome and pisa's institute of physics,
where he specialized in cosmic ray research . later, he was hired by
euratom, europe's communal atoms-for-peace agency, and went off to
brussels, leaving his wife maria and their two children behind in pisa
. an expert on thermonuclear power and a jolly nice chap, martelli came
to the attention of a british physicist, through him won a place on the

in the cotswolds . there, in room 103, giuseppe spent his days in pure
research, the kind of science that is not expected to yield concrete
results until the 1980s ; like all euratom projects, it involved no
classified information . after a few weeks in england, giuseppe set up
house among a group of scientists in nearby abingdon . returning to

yugoslavia talking to tito on his way home after a 16,000-mile
swing through ankara, teheran, karachi and new delhi, u.s . secretary
of state dean rusk squeezed in a short stop in belgrade . for the
diplomatic record, rusk officially was repaying a 1961 visit to
washington by yugoslav foreign minister koca popovic . but there was
more to rusk's courtesy call than that . u.s.-yugoslav relations were
never really warm ; since the u.s . congress last summer served notice
that it would eliminate belgrade's " most favored nation " trading
clause this year, they have been positively chilly . marshal tito's
ostentatiously friendly trip to moscow last year did not improve
matters, either . but belgrade was anxious to assure the u.s . that it
was officially still " unaligned, " and to smooth things over, rusk
agreed at the last minute to make his visit . popovic was out at modern
sucrin airport to greet rusk when the big u.s . jet touched down . also
on hand was a red carpet and a military band . but that was the end of
the fanfare . since the yugoslavs do not unfurl foreign flags along the
new autoput that leads from the airport to the city except for a
visiting chief of state, rusk's route was lined with blueand-white
finnish banners in place for president urho k . kekkonen's arrival next
day . there were no crowds at all, since the yugoslavs did not bother
to announce rusk's trip in advance . after lunch with popovic and a
reception at the u.s . embassy given by retiring u.s . ambassador
george kennan, rusk paid a call on tito in his belgrade villa .
yugoslavia has some 1956 vintage u.s . military equipment for which
tito would like spare parts ; since 50 per cent of yugoslavia's
commerce is with the west, it is worried about the rising tariff walls
of the six-nation common market . naturally, tito raised the problem of
/ most favored " nation status which, if eliminated, could sharply
boost import levies on yugoslavia's $30 million annual trade with the
u.s . rusk could offer no assurances that the clause would be restored,
since the decision is up to congress . on the whole, it was a pleasant
if inconclusive chat . then, less than 24 hours after he arrived, the
secretary of state, his wife, and 28 aides who had accompanied him on
the five-nation trip, packed up and headed for washington .

france liberte, egalite mais verite ? " every frenchman, " by
ancient axiom, " is willing to die for his country ; but none is
willing to pay for it . " so passionately do the french pursue their
democratic ideal of representation without taxation that cheating le
fisc, as they call the income tax bureau, has become the most pervasive
and engrossing national passtime after love-making and a far less risky
one . as a result of the centuries-old duel between chronically
strapped governments and perennially poor-mouthed citizens, france in
theory imposes higher income taxes than almost any other western
country, and in practice collects less : a mere 14 per cent of
government revenue v . 60 per cent in the u.s . " everybody is a
conspirator, " lamented premier (and onetime banker) georges pompidou
as his government launched a fact-finding program called operation
verite (operation truth), whose main aim is to get frenchmen to do what
comes unnaturally to report their earnings . why, cried the premier, "
it is nearly impossible to know even what a government employee earns
! " in 1961, the government estimates, at least 36 million of
france's 46 million people paid not a single sou of income tax ; by
the most conservative reckoning, 50 per cent of those who should pay
taxes got off scot-free . even more remarkable, in the midst of
unparalleled upper-crust opulence, was that in all france only 1,014
citizens barely enough to support one of paris' #$ #$ #$ restaurants
admitted to earning more than $12,800 a year . fiscal camouflage . the
injustice of the system is that hapless wage earners, whose incomes are
recorded on company payrolls and are thus easily available to le fisc,
shell out two-thirds of all the income taxes collected in france .
while the rich get richer, thanks to an economic boom and the native
genius for fiscal camouflage, rich and poor alike most shoulder massive
consumer taxes, such as the 74 per cent levy that makes french gasoline
(90 #$ a gallon) europe's most expensive . tax reform has seldom seemed
more imperative, for the government needs urgently to be assured of
ever-rising revenues for such huge undertakings as its force de frappe,
including an extravagant three-year buildup for france's first hbomb
tests in the pacific, announced last week . at the same time, the
economy is threatened by a burst of inflation that has boosted incomes
and prices 11 per cent in the past year and threatens to get out of
hand in the wake of the recent, successful miners' strike for higher
pay . poodles & picassos . to put teeth in its tax-extraction campaign,
the government has unleashed a horde of expert snoopers who descend
unexpectedly on companies and can spot a padded payroll as unerringly
as a michelin inspector exposing a warmed-over sauce bearnaise . but
experience proves that it will take far more ruthless measures to make
individual frenchmen divulge their true earnings . in 1947, when robert
schuman was finance minister, the government did its best by
introducing the theory of " external signs of wealth, " a wondrously
complex latin formula whereby tax inspectors gauged a man's richesse by
counting and grading his servants, cars, yachts, dogs (purebred or
mongrel ? ) and declarable mistresses . as a result, wealthy
parisians let the paint peel from their houses, put their picassos in
the attic, and claimed that their pedigreed poodles were used
exclusively as watchdogs, which are taxexempt . (le fisc finally
abandoned its hit-and-mistress methods this year.) when the inspectors
started demanding taxpayers' financial records, artful frenchmen from
plumbers to landlords retaliated by insisting on cash for their
services ; the most fashionable doctor in paris today would sooner
vote for socialized medicine than accept a patient's check . the
government's biggest problem is that honesty, as french taxpayers see
it, is not merely irrelevant but almost certainly disastrous as well .
a high-minded young parisian artist once filed a scrupulously accurate
tax return and was horrfied to find that the skeptical local inspector,
applying the standard correction factor, credited him with three times
the income he reported . this week the government presented an
ambitious program of social and economic reform to the national
assembly, and the perennial question of how to pay for it once again
came to the fore . of course, de gaulle could always imitate the
anglo-saxons and send tax evaders to jail . but then how would he raise
the revenue to build all those new prisons ?

middle east shifting fortunes in a letter to the moslem wise
men of egypt's 1,000-year-old al azhar university, a distraught iraqi
electrician wrote : " i vowed to sacrifice my son for arab unity . now
that it has been achieved, should i carry out my vow and kill my boy .
an al azhar scholar replied that he was moved by the writer's faith,
but warned that moslem law forbids human sacrifices . therefore, " your
vow carries no obligation and should not be executed . " lowered flags
. there was a more material reason for the electrician to abstain from
filial murder : arab unity has been loudly trumpeted by egypt, syria
and iraq, but it has hardly been consummated . on the surface,
everything seemed to be proceeding according to plan . syria and iraq
lowered their national flags and raised instead the official three-star
banner of gamal abdel nasser's united arab republic . ministers raced
from capital to capital discussing plans for merging foreign services,
school systems, airlines and textbooks . military delegations brooded
over the vital amalgamation of the three armed forces . jurists were
hard at work on a draft of a new federal constitution to be jointly
voted on next september . neighboring jordan seethed with an unrest
that might dethrone king hussein and force the nation to join an arab
union . cairo's press headlined that hussein was challenged by his army
. syria and iraq papers reported " spreading revolution " and "
guerrilla war with pitched battles . " in damascus a band of jordanian
exiles, led by handsome, hotheaded ex-colonel ali abu nuwar, 40, set up
a rival " government . " abu nuwar had nearly toppled hussein in 1957,
but because of old friendship, the king spared abu nuwar's life and
banished him . ever since, abu nuwar has repaid the act of mercy by
promoting anti-hussein conspiracies . people's noose . as the pressures
mounted, radio baghdad called hussein the " hireling king " and the "
grandson of uncle sam, " warned that flight was the only escape from "
the noose the people are preparing for you . " instead of decamping,
king hussein last week closed his border against syrian arms and
agents, toured the old city of jerusalem, al birah and ramallah, where
he chatted with army officers and inspected troops in their sandbag
dugouts facing the israeli positions along the frontier . in his
determination to stay in power, hussein jeered at israel, partly to
pacify the palestinian arabs, who make up two-thirds of his 1,800,000
subjects, partly because israel's support for jordan independence is a
political embarrassment . the problem threatened to involve the
u.s . washington had given hussein assurances of support . with next
year's
u.s . election campaign to think about, president kennedy had to
concern himself with israel as well . in washington, new york's
republican senator jacob javits led a band of colleagues in calling for
a sharp change in the u.s . policy of " dealing evenhandedly' with
friend and foe alike in the middle east, " and attacked continued
financial aid to nasser . not an inch . at week's end, however, jordan
was still intact, and it was the arab unity movement that was reeling .
it had to do with a cabinet crisis in syria between the majority
belonging to the baath socialist party and the minority of strongly
nasserite ministers . the struggle had been brewing for two months, and
pro-nasser ministers frankly told newsmen that they intended to
overthrow the baathists . the baath counter-strategy, as enunciated by
its founder, michel aflak, was : " do everything to preserve unity,
but don't give an inch, and don't surrender any power . " when rumors
of a pro-nasser army coup last week swept the volatile syrian capital
of damascus, baath acted . more than 100 army officers were dismissed
or clapped in jail . in retaliation, all six nasserite ministers handed
in their resignations . deputy premier nihad elkassem, who had led a
syrian unity delegation to cairo last march and had sobbed with joy on
nasser's shoulder, cried, " we are giving up our responsibilities
because we have not been given the means to carry them out . " the
cabinet walkout was intended to bring the baathists to heel, and it
well might . isolated in power, with the street mobs sympathetic to
nasser and the army of uncertain loyalty, baath's only available allies
are the merchants and landowners, who most oppose nasser's social
objectives . their embrace could be as fatal to baath as israel's would
be to hussein . during the crisis, nasser was off on a good-will visit
to algeria, but, for once, egypt's press and vituperative radio showed
surprising self-control neither mentioned the syrian struggle or the
nasserite resignations . at week's end, cairo's military leaders
abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting to plan the merger of arab armies.

yemen another job for the u.n . to the blare of military
bands and the skirl of bagpipes, a troopship last week steamed into
egypt's sweltering sinai port of tor . aboard were 2,000 egyptian
soldiers, the first big contingent returning from the war in yemen .
army chief of staff lieut . general ali amer hailed them as "
victorious troops who have achieved a 20th century miracle, " to wit :
/ snatching the yemeni people from the pit of poverty, ignorance and
disease and leading them toward the path of dignity and development . "
double trouble . the return home of even a token contingent of
egyptians was achieved by the quiet diplomacy of veteran u.s . diplomat
ellsworth bunker, 68, who last year put together the dutch-indonesian
settlement that handed west irian to indonesia's sukarno . last week
the united nations announced that the parties embroiled in the yemen
civil war had accepted bunker's proposal for a u.n . observer team with
a double job . it will make sure that saudi arabia ends its support of
the royalist tribesmen fighting to restore imam mohammed el badr to the
throne he lost seven months ago, and also that egypt's 28,000-man
expeditionary force pulls out as promised . in obtaining the
settlement, bunker made three trips to saudi arabia and held "
extensive talks " with president gamal abdel nasser in cairo . giving
force to bunker's arguments was the basic policy decision of the
kennedy administration to back the pro-nasser yemeni republicans
against the feudal royalist tribes . this decision was undoubtedly
conveyed, tactfully, to saudi arabia's premier prince feisal by bunker
. unquestionably, nasser was also told that there is a limit to his
expansionist drive in the middle east, and that the u.s . unalterably
opposes his stirring up trouble in other arab countries . uppermost in
washington's mind was the danger that the fighting might spread into
saudi arabia, where the u.s . has big oil holdings . switched
allegiance . the u.n . observer team, which will be set up by the
former u.n . congo commander, swedish major general carl von horn, is a
device to save political face for everyone . saudi arabia had already
been cutting back on its supply of money and guns to the royalists,
largely because egypt's projected plan for unity with syria and iraq
made nasser far too formidable an opponent . the u.n . intervention
also gives nasser a way out of the yemen mess, which has tied up a
third of his army at a cost of $1,000,000 a day and nearly 5,000
casualties . on balance, nasser emerges as a clear winner . though
promising to remove his troops, he has the privilege of leaving an
unspecified number for the " training " of yemen's republican army .
about the only group not consulted was imam mohammed and his royalists,
whose grip on yemen has dwindled from half the country to the mountain
spine in central yemen . some 25,000 armed supporters of the imam are
still in action and still dangerous, but they are increasingly
isolated, and short of fuel and weapons . with the royalists cut off
from saudi supplies, nasser may well be able gradually to consolidate
his gains, cut down on his commitments, and ultimately complete his
victory by admitting republican yemen into his grandiose scheme for a
new united arab republic .

south africa dispensing with judges in 1960 chocolate-skinned
robert sobukwe, 38, head of the black nationalist pan-african congress,
was sentenced to three years in jail for " incitement to riot . " as
his release date drew near last week, sobukwe, a slim onetime
university lecturer, was hustled from the maximum-security prison in
pretoria to a bleak detention camp on robben island in table bay, six
miles from cape town . there he learned, just the day before he was to
receive freedom, that south africa's parliament had rammed through a
new security act empowering justice minister johannes vorster to keep
political prisoners in custody indefinitely, even after their sentences
have expired . shrugged sobukwe : " if you believe in freedom, you
must suffer for it . " endless repetition . the new measure, which was
demanded by prime minister hendrik verwoerd to meet a " crisis of
survival, " makes last year's sabotage act seem tame by comparison, has
already been dubbed the " no trial " bill . it promises the death
penalty for citizens who receive training in subversion abroad or urge
intervention by force in south africa . postal authorities can open,
read and hold suspicious mail . any political suspect, without trial,
can be placed in 90-day detention, which may then be endlessly repeated
. commented justice minister vorster : " this is as much power as i
need for existing circumstances . if necessary, i will take even
stronger steps . " only one member of the all-white parliament voted
against the bill .
amid government jeers, the lone progressive party representative,
brunette helen suzman, warned that black nationalism as well as white
nationalism feeds " on this type of kragdadigheid (toughness) . "
although prime minister hendrik verwoerd and vorster describe the
menace facing south africa as " communism, " the bill is clearly aimed
at two african nationalist groups calling themselves poqo and spear of
the nation . poqo (pronounced paw-kaw and meaning " for ourselves alone
/ in the xhosa tongue) patterns itself after the dreaded mau mau, which
terrorized kenya in the 1950s . it first rose to prominence last
november, when some of its members rioted in the wine-growing cape
community of paarl, hacking two whites to death with pangas . later,
opposing the total apartheid scheme to move most of south africa's 11
million blacks into nine tribal reserves, poqo butchered five whites in
the transkei . into the sea . according to black nationalist potlako
leballo, who fled to the british-ruled enclave of basutoland, poqo is a
terrorist offshoot of sobukwe's militant pan-african congress and is
determined to " murder the whites or chase them into the sea . " as it
turned out, leballo's big mouth did poqo more harm than good .
embarrassed british officials ordered his arrest, and he barely escaped
into basutoland's rugged mountains, leaving behind him a list of 10,000
black rebels in south africa . thanks either to coincidence or to
basutoland's connivance, south african police rounded up 2,000 rebels,
and poqo was on the run . spear of the nation, which operates with more
finesse than poqo and at present tries to spare human life, is the
militant arm of the african national congress, whose nobel prizewinning
leader, ex-chief albert luthuli, is under house arrest in rural natal .
spear's most spectacular coups to date have been the bombing of the
agricultural minister's office in pretoria and the blowing up of
several giant power pylons around johannesburg . sabotage trials
continue up and down the country . in the east rand town of benoni, a
black prisoner disrupted the court by shouting " shoot me now ! shoot
me now ! " the " no trial " bill has a provision aimed directly at
spear's saboteurs : it provides up to 15 years' imprisonment merely
for unauthorized presence in key factories or any other installations
which the government may choose to designate as " no-entry areas . "

overpowered their own officers, then raided leopoldville's city hall,
where they took some two dozen hostages, including two deputy mayors
and the mayor's pregnant wife . barricading themselves in their police
barracks, the well-armed cops waited for the government to ante up more
money . instead, premier cyrille adoula's government dispatched the
congolese army commander, general joseph mobutu, and units of
red-bereted paracommandos to the police compound . ordering his men not
to shoot, mobutu opened the camp's gate and strode in alone and unarmed
to face the mutineers . roughly he yanked the ringleaders out of the
mob one by one, and demanded that they give up . with that the revolt
collapsed, and mobutu his well-creased trousers stained with a spot of

driven off to jail through the jeering crowd at the camp's gate .

last week with the first cargo shipped from china to japan since the
two countries signed a recent trade agreement ending their five-year
official boycott of each other's goods . then, half way across the east
china sea one afternoon last week, the leap forward suddenly radioed
for help . four hours later, the pride of china's merchant fleet lay on
the ocean floor . the chinese crew, who took to the lifeboats and were
rescued by japanese fishermen, excitedly insisted in sign language that
their ship had been pursued by a submarine and hit by three torpedoes .
but to japanese naval authorities their story seemed as full of holes
as the leap forward herself . if the ship had really been torpedoed,
they pointed out, its 59-man crew could hardly have escaped without the
loss of a single life . besides, who would want to sink an unarmed
merchantman ? the u.s . announced that it, for one, had no subs in
the area . a more logical explanation lay in jagged scott rock, an
ill-defined group of reefs barely beneath the surface 120 miles
southwest of korea . the head of japan's maritime safety board was sure
the leap forward had gone aground . " an error of navigation, " he
shrugged . even radio peking seemed unable to swallow the idea of
hostile attack, announcing only that the government was " attaching
great importance " to the sinking . the tone of the broadcast suggested
that whatever face the skipper had saved in japan with his torpedo tale
would be quickly dissipated once he came back to face the music in

president was antoine meatchi, 37, a tall, ambitious northern tribesman

agreed in advance on the makeup of a 56-member national assembly,
divided among virtually all political parties, including olympio's
comite d'union unite togolaise and its onetime youth wing, juvento, so
that none has a majority . backing up the whole package is togo's
french-trained army, whose discontent over low pay and manpower led to
olympio's overthrow . its ranks have since been doubled to 550 men .

the fleet was really on . climaxing a two-year investigation, a

cream of the top naval leadership of conspiring to smuggle a
treasure-trove of contraband into the country . chief among them is the
former naval chief of staff, rear admiral royce de mel, 47 . when he
sailed grandly home from a 1960 goodwill cruise in asian waters, the
commission charged, the magazines of de mel's flagship and an escorting
frigate had been loaded with some $10,000 worth of bounty bought in
duty-free ports . main source was singapore, where de mel's bluejackets
had joyously laid in 100 cases of grant's scotch, 25 cases of other
brands of whisky, plus cases of rum, gin, brandy, champagne and beer,

tired of concessions . how far this grand design has receded from
reality is only now becoming fully apparent . the disintegration
started last january, when, as all the world knows, charles de gaulle
vetoed britain's admission to the common market . but while other
members of the six were varyingly irritated by de gaulle's way of
saying non and disappointed by britain's exclusion, few at the time
could have predicted the depth and duration of distrust that de gaulle
has stirred in europe . among the six, who have been deadlocked on all
major issues ever since, there is increasingly widespread apprehension
that france's adamantly self-centered policies may have dealt the
deathblow to the european community that was envisaged by its founders
. in brussels last week, at an angry meeting of common market foreign
ministers, west germany's foreign minister gerhard schroder declared
flatly that his government is tired of making economic concessions to
suit the french, while germany's dominant interests are imperiled by de
gaulle's foreign policy germany, which relies heavily on foreign trade,
is deeply concerned by the common market's isolation from the rest of
europe, and for strategic reasons is increasingly uneasy at france's
alienation of the u.s . the six, urged schroder, must " take a positive
attitude " to the " kennedy round " of tariff negotiations, " even if
it means a slowdown in our internal development . " france's foreign
minister maurice couve de murville, whose government is afraid of u.s .
competition in europe, repeatedly muttered " absurd " as schroder and
other foreign ministers pressed their case . however, schroder had a
potent weapon . france, europe's lowest-cost agricultural producer, is
demanding that the six adopt a uniform policy on farm prices by july .
since germany would be forced to find new work for at least a million
of its high-cost farmers if this happens, schroder warned that his
government would frustrate any attempt to adopt a common agricultural
policy unless france in return agrees to seek the broad reciprocal
tariff cuts that the other common market nations hope to achieve in
negotiations with the u.s . sixes & sevens . the most explosive issue
was a demand by a majority of common market nations that the community
form a permanent committee to maintain consultation with britain .
after insisting that the palais des congres caucus room be cleared of
advisers including several ambassadors couve de murville said furiously
that britain had been trying to undermine the common market ever since
de gaulle's veto . said he : " france cannot possibly accept this
british behavior . " but the shock waves have spread far beyond the
common market . britain, which only four months ago had such faith in
europe that it was ready to sunder its ties with the commonwealth and
with the european free trade association, had to swallow its pride in
lisbon last week and make a desperate effort even to keep efta together
at its first top-level meeting since february . the reason is that
britain's government has accepted the fact that it will probably not
enter europe during de gaulle's lifetime and, if the common market
should stagnate, may never join . france's design for a narrow,
protectionist, third-force europe has had its most traumatic effect on
washington, which ever since world war ii has taken for granted that
the u.s . and europe have common ideals and interests . last week, on
the eve of a ministerial conference to discuss the scope and approach
of the kennedy round of tariff cuts, it was already plain that france
is again determined to seek its own narrow self-interest, without
regard for its common market partners and with every intention of
blocking u.s . hopes of expanding trade with the new europe . indeed,
as long as the inner six are splintered and the seven remain outer,
there will be no new europe .

france an island fling france's premier michel debre last
week rushed from humiliating obscurity back to the very center of
french political life . eased out of office by president charles de
gaulle in 1962 and replaced by georges pompidou, debre had seemed
permanently relegated to the shadows last november when he ran as a
candidate for the national assembly in a supposedly safe constituency
and, despite a gaullist landslide, was solidly beaten by a local garage
owner . but debre was determined to try again, even though he had to
travel 6,000 miles to french-owned reunion island, a tiny volcanic rock
in the indian ocean, where a by-election offered another opportunity to
run for the assembly . the dour, fussy debre took no chances . he flew
to the capital city of st.-denis and campaigned vigorously, holding 70
meetings in three steaming, sweaty weeks . as was confidently
predicted, debre swamped his luckless opponent 30,908 to 7,365, partly
through the reunion tactic known as the " promenade, " in which
opposition voters are sent fruitlessly from polling place to polling
place, being told at each that they are not registered there . de
gaulle now views debre with a more kindly eye than he did during his
premiership a year ago ; according to waggish paris comment, pompidou
was like a mistress whom de gaulle saw with pleasure, but who lost many
of his charms when he became la legitime, that is, wife . if de gaulle
gives the expected nod, michel debre will take over the job of
president of the gaullist u.n.r . faction in the assembly and employ
his undeniable talents in dealing with the ineffective leadership, poor
organization and internal friction that have recently plagued the party

russia two on trial neither of the men who glared at each other
across the prisoner's dock in a crowded moscow courtroom looked very
much like a spy . dapper greville maynard wynne, 44, was a salesman who
lived quietly in london's fashionable chelsea section with his wife and
young son when he was not on the road selling electrical machinery in
russia and eastern europe . slender oleg penkovsky, 44, was a
muchdecorated russian war hero who recently had held the delicate job
of arranging east-west scientific exchanges for a soviet state
committee . but last week the incongruous pair went on trial for
espionage before a military panel of three soviet supreme court
generals . while klieg lights glared and some 300 perspiring spectators
sat on the edge of their seats for five days, the most bizarre spy
circus in postwar soviet history unfolded before their eyes . if the
two men's confessions could be believed, the west had pulled off a
spectacular coup in the cold war struggle for intelligence secrets .
for 18 straight months, from april 1961 until last october, penkovsky
had funneled to wynne and other couriers a stream of nearly 5,000
photographs of secret soviet data on missile developments, troop
movements, economic and political inside stuff from the communist party
central committee itself . just a chauffeur . it began in november
1960, when penkovsky got fed up with his moscow job . seeking " the
easy life, " penkovsky said he sent a letter to the u.s . embassy in
moscow, offering his services to the u.s . according to penkovsky,
officials in washington ignored the offer, fearing a trap . but
penkovsky was determined to work for the west . his chance came at last
when he struck up a conversation with wynne the following month at a
moscow reception for visiting british technicians . wynne was happy to
meet the russian, he said, because soviet contacts were useful for his
machinery business . thus, when penkovsky showed up next april in
london, supposedly to set up an exchange with british scientists, wynne
went out to the airport to meet him and show him around town . were you
merely a chauffeur ? asked the prosecutor . that's it, wynne replied
. exploded penkovsky to the court : " this is a child's tale . believe
me, citizen judges, i cannot understand why wynne tries to minimize his
role . i didn't need a chauffeur . i could have taken a taxi . " truth
was, said penkovsky, he was already relaying film to british
intelligence, and now was in touch with the americans as well . in
london he delivered two bulky packages of state secrets to wynne, tried
on british and u.s . colonels' uniforms just in case he decided to
defect, even discussed a possible escape from russia by submarine if
things got hot . he recalled more relaxed moments pub-crawling and
nightclubbing . box of chocolates . after london, there was paris .
wynne gaily showed the russian around fontainebleau, versailles, the
lido and the moulin rouge and willingly picked up the tab . penkovsky
handed over 15 more rolls of film and had five sessions with western
intelligence agents . on occasions when wynne came to moscow on a
business trip, penkovsky usually passed his information to him
concealed in a box of chocolates, which wynne allegedly gave to mrs .
janet chisholm, wife of a second secretary of the british embassy, for
relay to london . when mrs . chisholm suspected she was being followed,
she suggested that wynne give the " chocolates " to her children . on
his flights out of moscow, wynne carried book-size packages of secrets
wrapped in plain brown paper . penkovsky said that when he did not have
wynne around to act as courier, he used his code name, " young, " and
dealt directly with u.s . and british embassy employees through an
elaborate set of signals and telephone codes . it all worked fine until
last fall when the soviet police swooped down on penkovsky, extracting
the confession that implicated wynne . a few days later, russia's
agents located wynne in budapest and hustled him back to moscow .
learning from experience . through it all, wynne doggedly maintained
that he was only a businessman who had been snared in the coils of
british intelligence . at first, he said, he had no idea what the brown
packages or boxes of chocolate really contained . after it dawned on
him that he was a spy, he demanded no part of the " dirty business, "
but his superiors threatened to wreck his commercial affairs, and so he
kept at it . " my answers might seem naive to you professional
gentlemen here, " he said, to the laughter of the courtroom, " but i
had no idea how intelligence operated, i now know even before the
prosecutor finished his summation at the end of the trial, the
government newspaper izvestia appeared in the courtroom reporting his
demand for punishment : a death sentence for penkovsky and ten years
in jail for wynne . the military tribunal retired to confer, then
passed judgment . penkovsky would be shot ; wynne would do eight years
in jail .

west germany feather for ludwig's cap west germany's next
chancellor, economics minister ludwig erhard, passed his first test for
the big job last week . a week-long labor stoppage among 400,000
metalworkers in baden-wurttemberg was threatening to spread to the
industrial heartland of the ruhr . already $100 million had been lost
in idle factories . it was up to " uncle ludwig " to act and fast . he
did . summoning both sides to a wood-paneled conference room of the
economics ministry, erhard sat them down face to face, providing two
antechambers for both groups to use for their own discussions . then
the doors were shut and plentiful supplies of cigars, beer and schnapps
were brought in to loosen up the bargainers . erhard shuttled from room
to room, chiding, encouraging, cajoling each group as the struggle
continued to find a common ground . then in the early morning hours he
came up with a solution that just about split the difference between
union demands and management's offer . it was the propitious moment,
for each side now was groggy with fatigue or beer and before long each
side accepted the compromise a 7 per cent wage hike spread over 18
months (current average hourly wage : about 77 #$ ) . the feather was
in ludwig's cap, and he knew it . " it was a restless night, " he
beamed to cheering christian democratic union deputies next day . " you
know that i put all my prestige on the scale . " the c.d.u . lost no
time putting their hero's new prestige to use . worried over a string
of c.d.u . defeats in state elections, the party hustled erhard off to
start work in the campaign for next week's election in lower saxony .

1 berlin 2-12 two inches to safety since the hated wall went up in
1961, escapees have ingeniously gotten past it by tunneling, climbing,
jumping, or by just knocking it down . last week a young austrian
outdid them all, smuggling out his pretty fiancee and her mother
through the simple expedient of keeping his head down . heinz meixner,
20, had moved to west berlin two years ago to take a job as a lathe
worker . as a foreigner, he was able to cross the line freely into east
berlin, where, at a students' dance last september, he fell in love
with tiny, attractive margarete thurau . when margarete applied for
permission to emigrate to austria, communist police told her that she
should marry her young man in east berlin and settle down there . this
was more than meixner could bear . " as soon as i heard that, " says
meixner, " i made up my mind to get her out . " last exit . he laid his
plans with meticulous care . to get a good look at the communist side
of the friedrichstrasse crossing point for foreigners, meixner stalled
his motor scooter near the peppermint-striped steel beam that closes
the last exit in the wall . pretending to have engine trouble, he
measured the height of the barrier, found that it was only 37f in .
from the ground . his next step was to search the car rental agencies
in west berlin for a sports car small enough to slip under the beam .
he finally decided on an austin healey sprite, which, without its
windshield, measured 35f in . high . meixner confided in another young
austrian, gave him an exact timetable of his plans and asked him to
prevent any cars on the western side from starting into the barrier
area at the critical moment . at last, when his plans were complete,
meixner drove his little sports car back into east berlin to
margarete's house . margarete crouched in the narrow space behind the
driver's seat ; her mother was wedged into the luggage compartment . "
luckily, " says petite margarete, " mother is just like me . " leaving
nothing to chance, meixner also let air out of his tires to lower the
car . shortly after midnight, meixner drove to the entrance of the
frontier area, showed his austrian passport to a guard, who waved him
on to the customs
officer . bricks for mamma . it was the time for action . instead of
pulling up at the customs shed, meixner gunned his motor, skidded
around the slalom barriers, and shot past the startled guard . looming
before him was that last bar . for one terrifying moment, it seemed too
low to clear . but he had measured well . jamming his foot on the
accelerator, meixner ducked his head and whizzed into west berlin . by
the time he got there, he was going so fast that he left a 96-ft . skid
mark when he jammed on the brakes . safe with his passengers, meixner
explained his escape plan to startled west berlin police : " i figured
it would take the vopos three seconds to draw their weapons once they
realized what i was doing . but i thought i could make it in those
three seconds . besides, we had 30 bricks behind mrs . thurau to
protect her if firing started . /

great britain yer pays yer money, yer tykes yer choice
psephology, as guessing elections is called in britain, is about as
inexact an art as playing the football pools . faced with a general
election this year or next, the experts last week studied a rich crop
of auguries with unusual diligence and the usual results : they
disagreed . certainly, there was little to encourage prime minister
harold macmillan's conservatives in the outcome of 401 local borough
elections . with 2,973 seats at stake, the tories lost a total of 550
; the labor party gained 544, winning control of local governments in
such major cities as leicester, liverpool, bradford, bristol and
nottingham . labor officials claimed that if a general election were
held tomorrow, they would return to power with a margin of 90 to 130
seats . also last week, however, three separate opinion polls indicated
that labor's lead has shortened dramatically in the past month . a
daily mail survey estimated that tory support has increased a startling
7 per cent since april . the daily telegraph gallup poll reported a 2.5
per cent gain for the conservatives, whose support is now estimated at
36.5 per cent, to labor's 46.5 per cent the clues were not quite as
contradictory as they seemed . council elections in britain generally
mirror local economic conditions . while tory candidates were hurt by
high unemployment levels in many big cities, they also took a beating
in many prosperous suburban communities where householders were still
cross with the government for recently increasing their local taxes
(from 50 per cent to 300 per cent ) . national opinion polls, which in
the past have proved fairly accurate, apparently reflected britons'
satisfaction with a new head of steam that has begun to appear in the
economy . torn between contradictory portents, psephologists and
politicians were about equally divided on whether the general election
will be held this fall or next year .

1 great britain 2-12 remember mrs . sweeny ? you're the top, you're
mussolini, you're mrs . sweeny, you're camembert . back in 1935, when
cole porter's anything goes was the hottest ticket in town, margaret
whigham sweeny was more top than mickey mouse or a coolidge dollar .
chic, beautiful and rich in her own right, the 21-year-old english
beauty was married to gentleman golfer charles sweeny, for whom, the
gossip columnists insisted, she had jilted the young earl of warwick .
that same year ian campbell made headlines by taking as his second wife
louise vanneck, daughter of u.s . sculptor henry clews . (his first :
janet aitken, lord beaverbrook's daughter.) though unmentioned in the
song, campbell was even more top than mrs . sweeny . in 1949 he became
duke of argyll (family motto : " forget not " ), chief of clan
campbell, hereditary master of the king's household in scotland,
admiral of the western coasts and isles, hereditary sheriff of argyll,
keeper of dunstaffnage, carrick, tarbert and dunoon castles, and heir
to a burke's dozen earldoms, viscountcies, marquisates and baronetcies
. favored four . in 1951, two weeks after a lurid divorce from louise,
the duke married mrs . sweeny . last week in edinburgh, the toppers too
were divorced . their decree, 65,000 words long, took the judge, lord
wheatley, 4f hours to read through . it was no cole porter lyric . on
the basis of the evidence, declared the judge, the duchess, now 49, "
was a completely promiscuous woman whose sexual appetite could only be
satisfied by a number of men . " he named four specific adulterers :
john cohane, 50, a u.s . businessman living in ireland whom the court
described as a " self-confessed wolf " with " the morals of a tomcat "
; harvey combe, 37, onetime press officer at london's savoy hotel ;
baron sigismund von braun, 52, brother of rocket scientist wernher, who
was counselor of west germany's london embassy until 1958, and is now
his government's u.n . observer in new york ; and an unidentified
partner who had been photographed in the nude with the duchess . the
judge did not spare the duke, who, he said, admitted that he had shown
/ pornographic photographs " to " a mixed gathering in new york and
seemed to treat it as a joke . " added the judge : " i do not commend
his standard of taste and habits . " home with harvey . though argyll
had already discovered suspicious letters to his wife and a diary
inscribed with " cryptic " signals, he " succumbed to her charms, " as
the court put it . thus, the duke, said judge wheatley, had " condoned
/ his wife's adultery with von braun by resuming marital relations with
her in paris . the divorce was granted on the grounds of her adultery
in 1960 with harvey combe at the argylls' london house in upper
grosvenor street . the argylls' litigation, which had dragged on for 3f
years, was the longest, most expensive (estimated cost : $140,000) and
most sensational in scottish history . and it may not be over, since
the duchess has said that she plans to appeal the court's verdict . in
any case, she still faces charges of libel and conspiracy to sustain a
malicious charge of adultery, stemming from her own divorce petition
against the duke, which she dropped last may . in that suit, she
accused her husband of committing adultery with her stepmother .

moment gamal abdel nasser sailed into algiers harbor to begin his state
visit . the day he arrived, an algerian minesweeper that had escorted
nasser's yacht sank with the loss of three crewmen . then a pall was
cast over the celebrations by the death of algeria's foreign minister
mohammed khemisti, who had been shot by a crazed assassin (see
milestones) . on top of all that, a most unusual tornado swept across
the country, killing twelve algerians in one village . many a
superstitious algerian peasant was convinced that the egyptian visitor
had brought a hex with him . but there was a more concrete reason for
the disappointment nasser took with him last week when he pulled up
anchor and sailed away three days earlier than planned . from host
ahmed ben bella, algeria's young premier, nasser had gotten hearty
cordiality and words of acclaim, but no real promise to bring algeria
into nasser's scheme for a united arab republicsciple . as the only two
socialist rulers in the araz world, they had much in common . and ben
bella was duly grateful to nasser for his aid in the long struggle
against france . but at the conference table, nasser found ben bella to
be no fawning disciple . cool, tough and independent, the algerians
appeared more interested in their own revolution than in more grandiose
schemes . ten months after independence, algeria's 46-year-old bachelor
premier is busy consolidating personalized control over his restive
land . last month he eliminated his most dangerous rival, old
revolutionary comrade mohammed khider, by forcing him out as
secretary-general of algeria's ruling national liberation front . ben
bella took over the party post himself . also, ben bella is implanting
his own brand of " arab socialism . " he has nationalized one-third of
algeria's farm land, most of it french-owned, and handed it to "
management committees " of turbaned peasants . his regime has seized
scores of cinemas, hotels and restaurants from algerians who, in ben
bella's words, " fattened themselves like pashas " by buying up
property from fleeing frenchmen . unspoken alliance . but ben bella's
brand of socialism has distinct limits . algeria's chief alliance is a
strange, unspoken one, not with the communists or with any arab land .
it is with france, algeria's onetime overlord . as if to make clear its
continued endorsement of ben bella, france recently agreed to speed up
payment of its subsidies to algeria, budgeted for $210 million this
year, which comprise ben bella's chief economic support . in return,
algeria promises to use one-fifth of the total to compensate
expropriated french landlords .

syria to unity by disunion in cairo last week, egypt's no . 2 man,
field marshal abdel hakim amer, stormed at a syrian delegation : " is
nasserism a crime in syria now ? if it is, how can we face the future
together ? if there are in damascus people who consider nasserism a
crime, then how do you expect me to cooperate with them ? " what set
off amer's flood of rhetorical questions was the threat posed to
nasser's dream of arab unity by the gyrations of syria's baath party
leaders, headed by tall, lugubrious premier salah bitar . the baath
leadership wants arab unity as much as does nasser, but it has refused
to let the party be drowned in an allencompassing nasserite national
front . the conflict became acute last month when the regime began
purging the syrian army of pro-nasser officers and noncoms . in
retaliation, six nasserite cabinet ministers resigned . while students
staged sitins in the schools, pro-nasser mobs poured into the streets
of damascus and aleppo, where scores of demonstrators were killed or
wounded battling soldiers and police . as the violence in the streets
grew worse, the baath leaders faced the prospect of destroying arab
unity and lowering the prestige of their party . last week harassed,
mournful premier bitar finally gave in and resigned to be replaced by a
compromise candidate, dr . sami jundi, 40, a dentist from hama who was
previously minister of guidance and culture . there was some
possibility that the new premier might be acceptable to both sides :
to the baathists because jundi was once a party member and had stood by
the government ; to the nasserites because he has been a longtime
admirer of egypt's strongman and believes in unity at all costs . at
week's end, the regime in neighboring iraq was also giving ground to
the nasserites . the entire baath-dominated cabinet resigned, but lean,
balding premier hassan bakr was commissioned to form a new government,
presumably one with greater pro-nasser representation, which might
forestall street demonstrations and disaffection in the army .

south viet nam the pinprick war lumbering low over stone
age villages and thick jungles, troop-carrying helicopters swarmed
across the wild central highlands of viet nam last week . on the
ground, 10,000 south vietnamese infantrymen and marines spread out over
a vast, inhospitable sector south of tamky where no government troops
had set foot since 1938 . in one of the biggest drives against the
communist viet cong since the guerrilla war broke out in 1959, south
viet nam's government hoped to flush six red battalions and a
headquarters company from its longtime stronghold in the mountains .
main object of the month-long operation was to destroy viet cong food
caches and cut the reds' main supply line, the 400-mile ho chi minh
trail to north viet nam through neutral laos . the reds had plainly
evacuated the area in advance, but vietnamese officials explained that
they did not aim to kill viet cong guerrillas, only to isolate them .
if successful, said one, the sweep " will solve 50 per cent of our
military problems in the central highlands . " not so, retorted some of
the u.s . officers who were taking part . " it would take a whole u.s .
army division to block that trail, " said one . the clash of opinion
extends to virtually every aspect of the frustrating, wearisome war in
south viet nam and reflects its shadowy, hide-and-seek nature . it is a
war with no front lines and no decisive battles ; a war of
containment, not of conquest ; a war of lilliputian pinpricks and
brobdingnagian stakes . it is a day war and a night war, in which the
government controls most highways and waterways by daylight (though a
u.s . lieutenant and two vietnamese soldiers were killed in a daylight
roadside ambush last week), and the viet cong slip in from jungles and
swamps to take charge after dark . in the rugged north, it is a
mountain war, in which the reds are short of food, medicine, weapons,
and largely on the defensive ; in the south, it is a battle for the
nation's rice granary, where the guerrillas have cunningly foiled every
government attempt to clean them out . turning the corner . how is the
war actually going ? measured against the desperate situation that
faced general maxwell taylor on a fact-finding mission for the
president 19 months ago, there is room for qualified optimism . when
secretary of defense robert mcnamara returned from a conference with
service chiefs in pearl harbor last week, the pentagon said " the
corner has definitely been turned toward victory . " no one was setting
any timetable, but u.s . military chiefs and south viet nam's president
ngo dinh diem say that the war should be won " within three years . "
there are many soldiers in south viet nam who consider this wildly
optimistic ; some believe that the war may never be won . but almost
everyone agrees that things have improved . today there is little
danger that the viet cong will take over any of south viet nam's cities
. captured red documents indicate that they have given up hope of a
swift conquest, now aim merely, as the guerrillas' north vietnamese
boss ho chi minh said recently, " to wait out the americans . " the
south vietnamese government and its 14,000 u.s . military " advisers "
pin their hopes on an integrated, long-term plan that aims at isolating
and driving out the viet cong . basic element of the government's
battle plan is to resettle almost the entire rural population in some
12,000 " strategic hamlets, " with bamboo fences, barbed wire and armed
militiamen to keep the predatory viet cong from exacting food and
manpower from a helpless peasantry . already 8,000,000 villagers 59 per
cent of south viet nam's population are living in the 6,000 hamlets
that have so far been completed . problem with peasants . though the
government admits that fewer than onethird of the hamlets are
defensible against a determined onslaught, the reds are reluctant to
attack the villages for fear of antagonizing the people . in some
areas, thanks to higher standards of living in the hamlets, peasants
are for the first time informing government troops of the movements of
the viet cong . " if these people believe we can protect them with the
hamlets, " says one u.s . adviser, " our problem may be licked . "
however, most south vietnamese peasants are still either passive or
actively resentful of the diem regime, which is often personified by
oppressive, corrupt local administrators . for all his high hopes for
the program, aloof, autocratic president diem seldom stirs far from his
yellow palace in saigon to visit the hinterland and generate enthusiasm
for his cause .
sneaky petes . the area of the government's greatest frustration is the
mekong river delta, where 55 per cent of south viet nam's population is
centered and 75 per cent of its rice is grown . the peasants there have
resisted the hamlet program and have often been forcibly resettled in
fortified villages because they resent having to walk miles to their
paddies . in a successful attack on two hamlets last month, some 2,000
villagers simply vanished . the reds are particularly hard to flush out
of the delta because they often are impossible to distinguish from
peaceful peasants . on the other hand, u.s . special service troops "
sneaky petes " have made dramatic progress in the north by winning over
and training the dark-skinned, aboriginal montagnards . though they
have for centuries been victimized by the lowland vietnamese, who
contemptuously call them moi (savages), 150,000 montagnards now belong
to an aggressive, native force . help for bananas . militarily, the
decisive factor in the war to date has been the introduction of some
170 u.s.-piloted helicopter transports, which give the government's
troops the advantages of surprise and mobility that had hitherto been
the guerrillas' monopoly . the antiquated " banana " copters have
become increasingly vulnerable as the viet cong learn how to use new
rapid-fire weapons ; in one sortie near the delta village of apbac
last january, they downed five of 14 helicopters, including one of the
24 fast, rocket-firing hu-1b ( " huey " ) helicopters that now escort
most missions . last week a second company of 24 hueys arrived at a new
base near vinh long . " operations were down in the hundreds a year
ago, " says general paul harkins, commander of u.s . forces in south
viet nam . " now they're in the thousands . " but normal battlefield
statistics are largely meaningless . the viet cong's casualty rate is
rising, but the reds have actually increased their hard-core strength
(to an estimated 25,000) by recruiting more peasants . and though the
reds are losing many weapons, those that they are capturing are modern
mortars and machine guns, while those that they lose to government
forces are generally crude devices and obsolete rifles . vain pleas .
as the government troops become more efficient, the wily viet cong are
also learning new techniques . one of the viet cong's latest tactics
has been to mount a series of feinting attacks on a target, then to
withdraw, luring government reserve forces into a well-laid ambush . as
a result, badly needed reinforcements often hang back for fear of
walking into a trap . such a war is a new and frustrating experience
for u.s . military advisers . mindful of the fact that 73 americans
have lost their lives in the fighting so far, their most bitter
complaint is that military operations are constantly hobbled by
political considerations . the big command decisions have to be cleared
with president diem, who still leans heavily on such members of his
family as brother ngo dinh nhu, and the beauteous madame nhu, for
advice and support in the struggle against the communists . diem is
mistrustful of many of his best soldiers and fears also that continued
heavy casualties will undermine what public support he enjoys . u.s .
officers have pleaded in vain with diem to allow more small-unit
sallies and night operations to challenge the viet cong's after-dark
supremacy . in their impatience with diem, some exasperated u.s .
officials wish that he could be replaced by a more flexible man . but
they admit that there is no other leader in sight . the regime tends to
exaggerate its successes and minimize its failures, insists that its
airborne attacks have finally " disheartened " the reds and " caught
them off balance . " many combat-seasoned u.s . advisers think that
this is hardly enough . " hell, " says one, " if all we did was to keep
them off balance on guadalcanal, we'd still be there . " the advisory
war . strategically and politically, of course, the war for viet nam
has little in common with the battle of guadalcanal . the u.s . is not
running the war, but is trying to help a sensitive young nation to win
for itself . it is a guerrilla war in which, as president diem says, "
psychological aspects " may prove more important than killing the enemy
even though, in the u.s . view, his regime has done far too little, too
late, to win the support of the rural populace . after prolonged
pressure, the government agreed only last week to assume the $17
million annual cost of the hamlet program the u.s . in addition has
been spending $400 million a year in south viet nam and even this
reluctant decision by diem was largely influenced by fear that the
villagers were showing greater loyalty to u.s . administrators than to
the regime . distressing as they may be, the differences of opinion
between the government and its u.s . advisers are unlikely to abate .
in fact, if the war turns more clearly in south viet nam's favor, the
regime will probably become more impatient of u.s . advice . for the
vietnamese, it is,
after all, a war
for independence .

sarawak the rajah's return the brookes of
sarawak might have stepped from the pages of a conrad novel . the first
and last english family to occupy an oriental throne, they fought
pirates and hostile sultans, pacified head-hunters and brought the
white man's law to their cruel, vibrantly beautiful land in northwest
borneo . the brooke rajahs ruled their kentucky-size kingdom with the
stern dignity of a victorian paterfamilias, but with humanity and
imagination as well ; in the annals of colonialism, few dynasties have
been so selflessly devoted to their subjects' welfare . the first
brooke rajah was james, a wealthy, high-minded adventurer who sailed
out from england to " rid the malay archipelago of barbarism . " in
sarawak he found his opportunity . for the sultan of brunei, he subdued
a stubborn civil war between the malays and dyaks . in gratitude for
his services (plus $2,000 of brooke's cash), the oppressive sultan in
1841 made him rajah of sarawak . indifferent to crocodiles, boa
constrictors and poisoned arrows, the white rajah lived only for his
handsome, amiable people . in 1848 he was knighted by her britannic
majesty, and in 1864 britain recognized his raj . he died a bachelor in
1868 and was succeeded by his nephew charles, who ruled for 50 years .
ranee pan . the rajah who brought sarawak into the modern world was
charles brooke's son, who took over in 1917 . in the more humdrum world
of the 20th century, witty, cambridge-educated sir charles vyner brooke
became even more of a legend than his predecessors . he issued his own
stamps, flew his own flag, maintained his own army and police force .
his ranee was sylvia brett, the beautiful daughter of a viscount who,
it was said, had been sir james barrie's inspiration for peter pan .
another literary admirer was george bernard shaw . when sylvia married
the rajah in 1911, he wrote : ride a cock horse to sarawak cross to
see a young ranee consumed with remorse . she'll have bells on her
fingers, and rings through her nose, and won't be permitted to wear any
clothes . the brookes had three pretty daughters, who grew up in
england and were known to every tabloid reader as princess gold,
princess baba and princess pearl . at a glittering society wedding in
1933, gold became lady inchcape, but baba and pearl were toasted in
every pub when they were married : baba to a wrestler, pearl to a
bandleader .
stockpiling heads . their father
had little time for frivolity . a shrewd, selfeffacing administrator,
sir charles traveled to the far corners of his land persuading tribal
chiefs to end their wars and forswear head-hunting . when they
protested that their enemies' heads were needed to propitiate the gods,
the rajah ordered his english civil servants to stockpile mummified
leftovers from previous wars and to lend them out to the villagers as
needed . from his handsome riverside fortress in kuching, he brought
modest prosperity to the kingdom by exploiting its oil and rubber
resources as well as diamonds, birds' nests (for chinese gourmets) and
gutta-percha (for golf balls) . in 1941, celebrating the 100th
anniversary of the brooke
raj, sir charles gave
his people a constitution and set them on the road to self-government .
contemplating war-ravaged sarawak in 1946, sir charles sadly realized
that his raj had become an anachronism in the postwar world . ceding
sarawak to britain, he explained that his people would find " new hope
in an era of widening enlightenment, stability and social progress . "
another chance . when sir charles retired to london, with a $2.8
million trust fund that will ultimately revert to sarawak, the natives
fought bitterly against british rule, even killed the second governor,
who occupied the brookes' old palace . the country has never recovered
from the loss of its leader . when the malaysian federation (time
cover, april 12) comes into existence in august, strifetorn sarawak
will be one of its states and will have its best opportunity yet to
achieve prosperity and stability . the last white rajah did not live to
see that day . last week, at 88, sir charles vyner brooke died in his
london home . when the news reached sarawak, the spirit-worshiping
dyaks rejoiced, for they knew that his soul would return to the
stream-laced land of his fathers .
not to be confused, however, with
hemingway's fictional lady brett ashley or the reallife sylvia ashley .

attempting to seize power in december . after all, six of the seven "

dissolve by force during the abortive coup . they just might be a
little

observe all the flowery decorum of gallic justice . the presiding judge
was resplendent in erminetrimmed long red robes, and sat listening with
calm dignity . moreover, dia was not even charged with " plotting, "
only with the more vague " acting against the internal security of the
state . " taking the floor in his own defense, dia argued that he was
not guilty of the charges . when he sent gendarmes to overthrow
president leopold senghor and arrest pro-senghor deputies, dia said, he
was only trying to head off a plot against himself that stemmed from
his efforts to crack senegal's peanut monopolists . cried dia : " i
wanted a constitutional solution, they (senghor's men) wanted a
political one . " in reply, the prosecutor sounded downright
sympathetic . there were extenuating circumstances, he agreed ; dia
was obviously a misguided patriot who " thought that one could not be a
good senegalese when one was against mamadou dia . " but at week's end
the court gaveled an end to courtliness . after two hours and 15
minutes of deliberation, the justices sentenced dia to the maximum
penalty, life imprisonment .

she was black, and he was white . on the front pages of every southern
rhodesia paper last week was the fairytale romance of the rich, widowed
white rancher to the penniless darky daughter of one of his squatter
tenants . it began in 1961, and had pygmalion overtones . in his
iron-roofed big house, fuller-sandys, like henry higgins, daily gave
margaret lessons in the social graces of the region . margaret learned
to speak and read, slowly mastered the assembly of cutlery for a
four-course dinner . for hours, teacher and pupil pored over arithmetic
primers, encyclopedias and fashion magazines . one evening
fuller-sandys gazed at her in a special way ; she said yes and in
english . promptly fullersandys called on her gnarled father, an aged
and respected laborer on the place . naturally, fuller-sandys handed
over a bride price ($100) ; then fuller-sandys slipped a diamond
engagement ring on margaret's finger . it was a brave step in
white-ruled southern rhodesia . immediately the government fired
fuller-sandys as an adviser in the native affairs department, curtly
explaining : " you cannot administer africans and sleep with them . "
of 48 white friends fuller-sandys invited to the wedding last week, 34
sent their regrets . the beaming bride, carrying a bouquet of white
dahlias and wearing a white satin gown, had three african bridesmaids
for the ceremony on fuller-sandys's veranda, performed by the rev .
richard hughes, rector of an anglican church at que que 64 miles away .
that night, under a full moon, the wedded couple attended an african
celebration in their honor . there was much leap-dancing and yelling
around a campfire . during the evening fuller-sandys had a chance to
open a letter delivered to him earlier in the day . bearing neither
return address nor signature, it said, " you bloody white kaffir, what
a disgrace to the country you are . . . your beloved black bastard

and eye new arrivals at hellenikon airport . greek army engineers
prowled the sewers of athens, searching for hidden bombs ;
grey-uniformed cops stood guard 25 yards apart along the eight-mile
parade route . emotionally, a retired greek general announced that he
was personally ready to slash his wrists to give blood, if de gaulle
were shot . more prudently, greece's premier constantine karamanlis had

drifting smoke . in the event, the precautions seemed excessive . de
gaulle arrived promptly at noon in his blue-andwhite caravelle jet
airliner, inspected an honor guard as cannon smoke from the 21-gun
salute drifted into his face, then climbed into a rolls-royce
convertible with greece's tall king paul . as the motorcade reached the
city limits, de gaulle jumped to his feet, waved theatrically to the
athenians gathered under the pepper trees . at hadrian's arch, near the
temple of olympian zeus, he said with feeling : " no frenchman,
especially myself, could fail to be moved by this city, nor forget what
has been accomplished here for liberty in 3,000 years . " then he
plunged nearsightedly into the curbside crowd to shake hands a
procedure that gives his security guards perpetual jitters . but the
chance of a potshot at de gaulle was not the only worry of greek
leaders . the government was also uneasy that de gaulle might try to
embroil greece in his quarrel with britain over the common market, and
with the u.s . over nato defense . it was france, not greece, which had
pushed the trip . de gaulle had picked up an invitation made seven
years before to then president rene coty . paris also suggested that
the french fleet drop anchor in the piraeus to coincide with de
gaulle's arrival, and discreetly broached the plan of having de gaulle
address the greek public, as he had done with such success during his
german tour last year . when greek reaction to both ideas was cool,
they were abandoned . the hinge . nevertheless, greece was in a mood to
be wooed by le grand charles . athens officials were shocked last
summer, when the $20 million annual u.s . defense and economic aid was
abruptly cut off on the theory that the greek economy no longer needed
it . de gaulle is said to be prepared to climax his visit with an offer
of a $10 million development loan ; french investments in greece
already total $60x million and are second only to u.s . investment . at
a palace banquet, de gaulle made clear in a toast to king paul that he
hopes to extend france's influence from the " northern seas, " which he
called one of france's boundaries, to the eastern mediterranean, where,
he pointed out, greece is the " hinge between the latin and slavic
worlds, as well as between western europe and the middle east . " these
words, and de gaulle's wooing manner, set diplomats everywhere to a
fresh study of his upcoming ambitious travel plans : in october,
charles de gaulle, 72, is scheduled to visit iran and he is considering
later trips to japan, south america, north africa, and the newly
independent nations of black africa . " today, france, " murmured one

russia a
long, hot summer for months, dozens of speakers in scores of soviet
cities had been readying their ponderous lecture texts for the most
anxiously awaited date on the kremlin's spring calendar of events, may
28, when a special meeting of the communist party central committee
plenum would lay down the ideological law to restless intellectuals .
last week the long-scheduled meeting was put off until june 18 . the
last-minute breakdown in the kremlin's usually well oiled machinery
naturally touched off a wave of speculation . could nikita khrushchev
be having second thoughts over unleashing a wave of neo-stalinism ?
was the delay caused by the reported heart attack of the party's second
secretary, hard-liner frol kozlov (time, may 10), whose tough hand
might be needed on the spot to draft the orders for a cultural
crackdown ? was it another ploy against red china ? who knew ?
whatever was behind postponement of the plenum, the abrupt switch
served to delay moscow's coming confrontation with its rivals in peking
. two weeks ago, the red chinese finally got around to answering the
soviet invitation to discuss their nasty ideological quarrel face to
face, suggested a mid-june meeting in moscow . but since the soviets
could scarcely conduct two showdowns at the same moment, they suggested

first secretary of the communist party, bowed to mounting pressure from

birmingham, race riots exploded in the heart of the communist capital .
it began at midday near the ambassador hotel just off ancient wenceslas
square . two foreign students one from africa and another from the
middle east were out for a stroll when they were attacked by a gang of
300 czechs who pummeled them with fists and bunches of keys while
police stood idly by . that evening another group of young czechs began
swinging at an african walking with his czech wife, then picked a fight
with two more africans who had been arguing with some cubans . this

occurred . an african diplomat had parked his car to investigate the
trouble ; he returned to discover that all four of his tires were
slashed . five days later, when radio prague finally got around to
reporting the antiafrican outbursts, the regime glossed over the
incident as the work of drunken hooligans . it was more serious than
that . for months, czechs have complained that subsidies to
underdeveloped countries, including direct outlays to scholarship
students, are responsible for czechoslovakia's worsening living
standard . and the black students in prague sometimes seem to walk away
with the prettiest girls . the arrival of africans has created race

italy search for the feasible in rome's handsome,
half-moon-shaped chamber of deputies last week, everyone had to move
literally to the right to make room for the 166 newly elected
communists, a 20 per cent increase over their previous showing .
the reds promptly made their power felt in the balloting for presiding
officers : for the first time in history, a woman, maria lisa rodano,
42, was elected chamber vice president . she is a communist who insists
she is a roman catholic as well and attends mass on sundays . red boss
palmiro togliatti's cocky demand that communists be admitted to the
government was coldly refused . only solution . red jubilance was
matched by continued dissension in the christian democratic party .
focus of blame for the party's 4 per cent drop in votes is
premier amintore fanfani . hardfisted deputy mario scelba declared red
success " is the fruit of our mistakes and not of the superiority of
communist ideals . " scelba and others of the center and right strongly
oppose a continuance of the apertura a sinistra, the so-called opening
to the left, initiated last year by fanfani when he formed his alliance
with pietro nenni's socialists . trouble is, no other alliance seems
feasible . for the christian democrats, a coalition with the rightwing
monarchists and neo-fascists is unthinkable . " given the parliamentary
situation and the prevalent trends among the party, ented milan's
corriere della sera, " no solution is possible other than the so-called
center left . " what seems less certain is that pintsized, peppery
amintore fanfani will survive as premier . in accordance with italian
procedure, fanfani last week handed his resignation to president
antonio segni, who is expected to name a premier-designate this week
nfani is passed over, no . 1 candidate for the office will be the
christian democrats' tall, unassuming aldo moro, 46, who became interim
party leader in 1959 and has since emerged as party strongman . only a
caretaker . moro is said to be reluctant to take on the job, and his
lavish praise for fanfani at the party's national council meeting last
week suggested that he, for one, would press for little amintore's
continuance in office . in any case, he would not likely change
fanfani's policies, since he himself was one of the architects of the
apertura a sinistra and forced party acceptance of the plan with a
six-hour speech at last year's national congress of the christian
democrats in naples . but moro is somewhat less enthusiastic than
fanfani about economic planning, and could be expected to be more
outspoken about the need to check the communists . moreover, he might
be a lot more popular . where fanfani enjoys sharp exchanges and is
quick to trade insults, moro is reserved, anxious to avoid angry
debates whenever possible, and detests name calling . says one of his
friends, admiringly, " moro runs the party the way he drives a car . he
keeps both hands on the wheel and both eyes on the road, and he never
drives more than 35 miles an hour . " whether segni chooses moro or
sticks with fanfani, the premiership will probably be no more than a
caretaker's position for the next two months . for not until mid-july
will nenni's socialists hold their annual convention and decide whether
or not to stick with the christian democrats and keep the center-left
alliance alive .

economy, achieved a hefty trade balance, and socked away more than $500
million in foreign-exchange reserves that encouraged foreign investment

an agricultural diversification program to lessen dependence on rice,
thailand's single cash crop . today, the u.s . maintains some 4,500

army will work to perfect its counterinsurgency techniques . more than
its neighbors, thailand has a motive to fight against a potential
communist takeover ; of all the nations in southeast asia, thailand
alone has never been dominated by a colonial power, has been
independent since the 13th century . sarit is confident that his
program will keep it so . " the situation was quite serious, " he
admits, " but since we started to move in the northeast, the danger has
become less acute . " adds a top military aide : " thailand is in the

middle east from god, or nasser it is never fun to break up
a vacation and rush home to deal with some problem at the office . for
egypt's gamal abdel nasser, it was especially provoking, for he was
enjoying some of the world's loveliest scenery at marshal tito's villa
on the yugoslav island of brioni . but the cables from cairo carried
word that nasser's arab unity scheme was in a state of collapse .
reluctantly, egypt's leader boarded a plane and headed across the
mediterranean to deal with his troublemaking partners, the syrians .
behind the crisis was a gamble three weeks ago by syrian nasserites
that by yanking their six ministers from the cabinet they could bring
the government down, touch off street rioting, and snatch control from
the dominant baath party in the resulting confusion . up to a point,
that was exactly what happened . baathist premier salah bitar had to
quit ; his replacement was dr . sami jundi, supposedly a nasser
admirer . but as it turned out, jundi, after three sleepless days and
nights of trying to persuade both sides to cooperate, wearily stepped
aside to let another premier seek a solution . who was the new premier
? none other than bitar, who promptly filled the nasserite cabinet
vacancies with baath supporters and tightened the party's grip over the
army, thus completing a purge that had already sent two planeloads of
officers suspected of egyptian leanings into exile . within hours of
the antinasser stroke in syria, much the same thing happened in iraq .
there two nasserites were dumped from the cabinet and were replaced by
more pliable fellows . cairo was enraged at baath's " trickery,
treachery and terrorism . " thundered egypt's al gumhuria :. "
punishment from god is sure to come . or if not from god, from nasser .

morocco experimenting with elections arab and african leaders
generally sneer at hassan ii of morocco because he is a king in an era
of crumbled monarchies . yet such " progressives " as egypt's nasser
and ghana's nkrumah would not dare to let their own people indulge in
the measure of press freedom and political democracy that hassan
allowed in last week's national elections . at stake were 144 seats for
a house of representatives, the first freely elected chamber since
morocco won independence from france seven years ago, and the field was
wide open . hassan's major opposition parties, the nationalist istiqlal
and the leftist national union of popular forces, were out in strength,
and even the communist party officially outlawed but quietly tolerated
fielded three candidates . opposition newspapers circulated freely, and
one prominent politician got away with calling the king a liar . two
months before the election, hassan also entered the race by having his
closest confidant, interior-agriculture minister ahmed reda guedira,
40, organize a pro-hassan party christened the front for the defense of
constitutional institutions . unsurprisingly, the f.d.c.i . enjoyed the
use of government vehicles to haul wondering tribesmen to rallies, plus
the organized support of the government's administrative bureaucracy .
flush with compaign cash, f.d.c.i . leader guedira (who got some
pointers when he witnessed the 1960 u.s . election campaign) passed out
thousands of free miniature soccer balls, t-shirts and campaign buttons
bearing the royalist party color (yellow) . more important for hassan,
however, was the traditional apathy of morocco's 75 per cent illiterate
population . in the ancient city of fez, a heavily veiled scrubwoman
candidly declared, " i do not know what it is all about, but i am going
to vote for my king . " hassan's royalists expected to win enough seats
to assure the king of a plurality . in any case, he did not have to
worry much, for there were limits to his experiment in democracy .
under a new constitution he personally drafted last year, he can
dissolve the house at any time he chooses .

saudi arabia the ailing, failing king in recent months
62-year-old kingsaud of saudi arabia has suffered a succession of
intestinal, stomach, chest, circulatory and heart ailments . often they
seem to be aggravated by the swirling political events in his desert
capital of riyadh . after the yemen rebellion last fall threatened the
stability of his throne, saud's health was so upset that he turned the
government over to his able brother, prince feisal, and flew to
switzerland for treatment . while saud spent weeks convalescing in
paris and on the riviera, prince feisal was using a new broom at home .
he fired all of saud's sons and aides who held government posts, and
cut royal family allowances a whopping 20 per cent . in a series of
speeches, feisal told wide-eyed citizens : " with god's help, you and
your government are going the right way . education, medical care and
social security are all completely free . " in answer to doleful pleas
from his sons and relations, king saud cautiously returned home last
month . a few tribal delegations came to riyadh to pay their respects .
one, led by deputy premier prince khalid, another of saud's 39
brothers, handed the king an ultimatum . tactfully but plainly, the
chieftains warned him not to interfere with feisal or make any attempt
again to wield power, at the risk of dethronement . they also demanded
instant banishment of saud's personal aide, eid ben salem, who rose
from palace chauffeur to royal entrepreneur and became vastly rich in
the process . saud caved in . ordered out of the country, ben salem,
who has his fortune stashed in european banks, flew off nonchalantly to
beirut . forty-eight hours later, saud got an even worse shock : one
of his favorite wives, handsome princess im mansour, vanished from the
palace to join her lover, ben salem, in exile . the personal and
political blows combined to impair the regal health once again . moslem
pilgrims to mecca who were booked on half a dozen jet flights home
suddenly found their passages had been canceled . instead, the
airliners flew to riyadh, picked up the ailing king and his huge
retinue, and carried them off to vienna . at week's end king saud was
reportedly in an oxygen tent, responding to treatment for a duodenal
ulcer . doctors predicted recovery within a few weeks, but rumors still
filtered through vienna that saud was in fact quite ill . should saud
die, prince feisal will become king in name as well as in fact .

africa together at the " summit " the normally sleepy ethiopian
capital of addis ababa was astir with feverish activity last week .
crowds of ragged citizens stood gaping as workmen rushed to install
huge portraits of prominent africans across from haile selassie's
palace . finishing touches were being put on a spanking new hotel .
mile after mile of 8-ft.-high corrugated iron fence was being put in
place along main streets to hide the city's shabby slums . all the
excitement was in anticipation of this week's pan-african " summit "
conference of some 30 african heads of state . never before had so many
leaders of africa sat down in the same place at the same time, and
their proud host, the aging (70) ethiopian emperor, was out at the
airport in person with his green-andblack rolls-royce to greet many of
his illustrious guests, including liberia's president william v .
shadrach tubman, who arrived five days early so as to squeeze in a
state visit . the guest list was a who's who of africa's successful
revolutionaries and moderate nation builders . ghana's egocentric
osagyefo (redeemer), kwame nkrumah, was due in from accra . from the
congo would come the embattled premier cyrille adoula . also on the
list : nigeria's able prime minister sir abubakar tafawa balewa ;
senegal's senghor ; guinea's sekou toure ; and dozens more,
including, of course, that affable fellow from up north, egypt's gamal
abdel nasser, who was an african of a kind . predictably, there were
those interested in bending the conference to their own ends :.
ghana's nkrumah sent a 120-member delegation piling into addis ababa
complete with a high-life dance band . osagyefo would be peddling his
pet scheme for a bicameral all-africa parliament and other similar
quickie approaches to a united africa . no one was likely to buy
nkrumah's schemes, however, for it has long been obvious to all of
africa that it is basically nkrumah that nkrumah wants to promote .
apart from that, regional differences make it clear that the most that
can be achieved in the foreseeable future is a loose association of
african countries patterned after the organization of american states,
with a permanent secretariat, council and program for economic
cooperation . such a grouping might help heal the rifts among the
continent's current rival blocs chief among them the leftleaning
casablanca group (ghana, guinea, mali, morocco, algeria, egypt), and
the more moderate monrovia group, now composed of nigeria, liberia,
sierra leone, ethiopia, the former belgian congo, and most of the
former french dependencies .

europe first, the shell in major diplomatic conferences on
both sides of the atlantic, the u.s . last week confronted the new,
assertive europe . at geneva, the u.s . started to bargain for its
future economic relations with the common market, which is just five
years old and is already the world's biggest trading bloc . at ottawa,
in recognition of its allies' new strength, the u.s . initiated the
slow, painful process of sharing with europe control of nato's nuclear
armory . if neither conference produced dramatic results, both narrowly
skirted breakdowns that might have gravely damaged the atlantic
partnership . naked europeans . despite france's aversion to
tariff-cutting, u.s . negotiators at geneva hoped to achieve
far-reaching liberalization of world trade through president kennedy's
trade expansion act . special envoy christian herter and his 20-man
delegation who were dubbed " onward christian's soldiers " by the press
corps aimed for an agreement whereby europe and the u.s . would make
big, equal, across-the-board percentage cuts on huge categories of
goods . nothing doing, retorted the europeans, who pointed out that u.s
. tariffs are generally higher than europe's, while the highest u.s .
tariffs cover far more goods (20 per cent of all u.s . tariffs are over
30 per cent v . 1 per cent of europe's) . thus, protested eurocrats, if
european nations cut their already lower tariffs by the same percentage
as the u.s., they would end up " naked, " while the u.s . would still
be comparatively well protected . in any case, shrugged europeans, the
u.s . in 1962 earned nearly twice as much ($4.4 billion) in the common
market as it bought from the six . so why make things easier for the
americans ? inside the egg . the talks actually had broken down, when
west germany's ludwig erhard devised the last-ditch compromise that
proved acceptable to john f . kennedy . it calls for both sides to make
equal, across-the-board percentage reductions, as proposed by the u.s .
though they will probably fall far short of the ideal 50 per cent
envisaged by washington . in return, the u.s . agreed in principle to
make drastic cuts in the highest tariff categories . since the fine
print will not actually be negotiated until may 1964, some u.s . and
british officials were fearful, as one put it, that " france has only
moved her roadblock down the road . " concluded erhard : " we are
agreed on the shell of an egg . what will be in the egg, we do not know
. " at ottawa everyone knew what was in the egg, but no one knew what
to call it . well in advance of last week's semiannual nato council
meeting, the u.s . and its allies had agreed on a new addition to
nato's alphabetical armory : ianf, meaning interallied nuclear force .
a limited first step toward giving nato its own nuclear deterrent, ianf
now consists mainly of 180 british v-bombers and three
mediterranean-based u.s . polaris submarines that the two nations will
turn over to nato command . while it also includes 60 french tactical
bombers, for which the u.s . controls the nuclear warheads, the french
government hinted that it might withdraw them if ianf were made to seem
bigger and more powerful as it is than france's vaunted force de frappe
. thus the allies agreed that if france agreed not to make any scenes
at ottawa, ianf would be nameless it soon became known as that thing by
any name, the new force is intended to give the nato allies a greater
sense of participation in nuclear strategy, but will do little to
increase their actual role in the defense of europe . a more
significant development, in the u.s . view, would be formation of a
multilateral force (mlf), comprising some 20 polaris-firing surface
vessels that would be jointly owned, crewed and paid for by the
participating allies . its main purpose, of course, would be to
accommodate west germany's eagerness for a nuclear role commensurate
with its economic and political power . but the u.s . will have to
yield far more if it is to meet its allies' demands for control of
their own nuclear defense . in ottawa, as at geneva, the dialogue had
barely begun

great britain trollope, hot tide better education . new industries
. better transport . that promise, in five columns of type across
newspaper pages, was made last week by the conservative party,
launching its first advertising campaign since its
you-never-had-it-sogood series in 1959 . the tories' new theme : "
britain is modernizing now and only the conservatives have got what it
takes to see the job through . " though the government has yet to set a
date for the election, the costly manifesto suggested that prime
minister macmillan intends to go to the people sooner rather than later
perhaps in the fall . next day the opposition burst into print with its
own long-planned ad campaign featuring a new symbol, a well-knuckled
thumbs up the toiler's equivalent of the tory v-for-victory gesture and
the slogan : let's go with labor . the laborites devoted half of their
first bold spread to a picture of party leader harold wilson for once
without a pipe and used the rest of the space to explain the " changes
the new labor government intends to make . " they ranged from a
shake-up in industry ( " too many directors sitting in board rooms
because of their family background " ) to an expanded scientific
program to " prevent our best brains from taking jobs abroad . " if
there was nothing startlingly new in labor's promises or, for that
matter, in the tories' copy many britons were astonished that the
socialists had taken any advertising at all . after the 1959 election
campaign, laborites thundered that the tories' ad agency had used "
madison avenue methods " to " sell macmillan like a detergent . " when
he projects his own image, harold macmillan sounds more like trollope
than tide . in an interview with publisher jocelyn stevens in last
week's issue of queen magazine, the prime minister indulged in some
mellow ruminations that could never have been cued by an adman : on
power . i never had any feeling about becoming prime minister . i took
things as they came and still do . power is like a dead sea fruit .
when you achieve it, there's nothing there . the art of government is
mixing the thinkers and doers . on himself . yes i am sensitive to
criticism . one has to be . there are moments when i loathe everybody,

africa a small taste of unity
in the cavernous,
thatch-roofed banquet hall of addis ababa's menelik palace, 30
colorfully garbed african heads of state and 2,000 other guests, all
backslapping and jovial, were feasting at the board of their medaled
host, ethiopan emperor haile selassie . as waiters in green-and-gold
livery moved among foodladen tables, the throng fell to on caviar,
roast chicken, spiced lamb and watt (spongy ethiopian bread), washed
down with hundreds of gallons of french wine, ethiopian honey wine, and
vintage champagne . then, as the clock ticked past midnight, everybody
sat back to watch the emperor's select group of flimsily clad dancing
girls writhe to the tootles of the imperial bodyguard band . " unity
now ! " for all their festive camaraderie at haile selassie's party,
not all the delegates to africa's first " summit conference " last week
were pals . tunisia's habib bourguiba loathes ghana's powerseeking
kwame nkrumah who is jealous of egypt's abdel nasser who despises the
ivory coast's felix houphouetboigny who in turn is contemptuous of
senegal'spoet-president leopold senghor . the antagonisms became amply
evident during the long oratory that flowed out of the conference work
site, haile selassie's proud, new " africa hall . " eyes glittering,
nkrumah took the floor to demand " unity now .e in the form of a vast
united states of africa, ruled by a bicameral congress and a strong
presidency (which, no one doubted, nkrumah feels himself eminently
qualified to occupy) . nkrumah likened the addis ababa meeting to the
1787 constitutional congress in philadelphia, whose delegates, he said,
thought of themselves not as " virginians or pennsylvanians, but simply
americans . " cried ghana's self-styled redeemer : " we meet here
today not as ghanians, guineans, egyptians, algerians, moroccans,
malians, liberians, congolese, or nigerians, but as africans . " slap
for kwame . there was polite applause, but much of the audience was
lukewarm to the ambitious scheme . malagasy's president philibert
tsiranana replied candidly : " you cannot decree a text for african
unity of our states are not mature enough . " urging a slower,
step-by-step approach, sir abubakar tafawa balewa, the able prime
minister of nigeria, africa's most populous state (42 million, six
times ghana's population), took the opportunity to spank nkrumah for
his notorious meddling in his african neighbors' affairs . " unity
cannot be achieved as long as african countries continue subversion
against others, " balewa declared . he drew a storm of cheers, and even
nkrumah's old friend, modibo keita of mali, joined in to denounce "
black imperialism . " with the conference obviously in no mood for
grandstanding, egypt's ubiquitous gamal abdel nasser prudently confined
himself to generalities .
africa's summiteers did
manage to put together an agreement of sorts in their four days of
talks . in a marathon final session, the delegates solemnly and
unanimously adopted a draft charter for a loose " organization of
african unity . " to go into effect when ratified by twothirds of
africa's nations, the scheme calls for a heads-of-state gathering every
year, a permanent council of ministers (with no real powers), and a
permanent secretariat . pending ratification, a provisional secretariat
will be set up in addis ababa, to the delight of haile selassie, who
dreams of making his ramshackle capital africa's capital as well .
under the plan, committees would be formed to mediate intra-african
disputes, promote economic and social progress, joint defense, and
mount a common front against africa's remaining vestiges of colonialism
and white supremacy .

france apres de gaulle blossoming chestnuts cast their shade over
the bookstalls along the seine, traffic wheeled insanely around the
place de l'etoile, and the first tourists with their cameras sank
contentedly last week into chairs at sidewalk cafes . but to french
politicians, the coming of spring meant revival of that heady
atmosphere they call " apres de gaulle . " with presidential elections
just two years away, it has simultaneously occurred to many pundits
that de gaulle may become ill, die, be assassinated, or just decide not
to run . the infectious presidential fever has spread to all parties .
on the non-gaullist side, possible candidates range from antoine pinay
(at 71, he may be too old) to the last premier of the fourth republic,
pierre pflimlin, to the glib radical spokesman, maurice faure . the
socialists have contenders in veteran guy mollet and the shrewd,
affable mayor of marseille, gaston defferre . most prominent on the
gaullist side are premier georges pompidou, the national assembly's
tennis-playing president jacques chaban-delmas and ex-premier michel
debre . recently elected as a deputy from reunion island, debre cannily
refused the confining job of faction leader of the gaullists in order
to establish himself as mr . fixit for problems throughout the country
. under the spur of debre's competition, pompidou is now functioning
more like a politician and less like a banker turned statesman . in
nationwide broadcasts, he has proved to be a relaxed, avuncular
performer and has displayed wit as well as competence in the national
assembly . into this list of hopefuls, the intellectual, left-wing
l'express last week introduced a weirdly different suggestion . it
claimed that de gaulle's own choice as his successor is none other than
henri d'orleans, 54, comte de paris, descendant of king henri iv, and
pretender to the throne of france . l'express pointed to the warm
personal friendship between the count and de gaulle, recalled that le
grand charles's earliest political sympathies were monarchist, and
noted that the count's gaullist leanings had made him a target of a
bombing by secret army terrorists . l'express concluded : " this
vision is one which haunts de gaulle's meditations, and it would
reconcile two heretofore antagonistic principles monarchy and republic
in a single legitimacy, that of royal descent and universal suffrage .
/ only trouble with this vision is that l'express hates de gaulle and
would be the last paper to know what he is thinking . paris-presse
characterized the story as little more than " a good question to toss

concessions on both sides, " insisted a french diplomat . true enough,
but who else these days is wringing concessions from charles de gaulle
.q? not kennedy, macmillan or khrushchev . only stubborn, tenacious
prince rainier . the crisis began last year, when france issued an
ultimatum ordering monaco to align its tax structure with france and
end its status as a haven for freeloading french corporations and
businessmen . the monegasques, enraged at the prospect of losing their
freedom to pay no income tax to anyone, rallied behind their prince .
rainier struck back at de gaulle by issuing a series of three stamps
commemorating louis xi's recognition of monaco's independence in 1512 .
both
sides mobilized their resources . france had nuclear bombs and 600,000
battletested soldiers v . monaco's 80-man palace guard and 170
policemen . france could also cut off monaco's gas, electricity, postal
and telegraph services . but monaco had a sharper weapon : ridicule .
moreover, prince rainer's little principality could halt the " blue
train " as it passed through monte carlo to the italian border, and
could revoke its agreement to collect garbage in the adjacent french
town of beausoleil . there were some tense moments last fall when
french police set up a customs post at monaco's border and began
stopping cars, but cooler heads at last prevailed . throughout the long
winter months, delegates of both states hammered out six separate
treaties covering everything from taxes (no income tax for monegasques
or longtime french residents of the principality) to postal rates .
monaco emerged largely victorious . when the treaty was signed last
week, prince rainier and princess grace ended a tour of the u.s., flew
back home to receive a grateful welcome from their still taxfree
monegasque subjects .

happy night, with plenty to eat, talking about the struggle now past
for they had been seven days passing through the country of the kurds,
fighting all the time, and they had suffered worse things at the hands
of the kurds than all that the king of persia, and his general,
tissaphernes, could do to them . anabasis of xenophon enemies of the
kurds have always had a hard time of it, from xenophon and his ten
thousand greeks in 400 b.c., through persians, mongols, turks,
crusaders, arabs and british, up to this year, when the regime of
iraq's karim kassem was bled white by the effort to crush one more
uprising of the ever-rebellious kurd strike . in baghdad last week, the
new iraqi regime that deposed and killed kassem in february finally
faced up to the issue of peace or continued war with the kurdish
leader, mustafa barzani . " the very day of the revolt against kassem,
/ said an angry kurdish rebel, " the new iraqi revolutionary command
called for kurdish support . with the revolution, the iraqi armed
forces were totally disorganized, and we could easily have struck deep
into iraq . instead we accepted their promises and held our fire . "
what the kurds are demanding is regional autonomy with a kurdish
legislature and executive council, a proportionate share for kurds of
all revenues, oil royalties and foreign aid and, finally, special
kurdish army units with the sole right to garrison kurdistan . the
iraqi government last week stiffly rejected the kurdish memorandum,
offering them instead only local self-government in a restricted
mountain area that would have excluded virtually all major kurdish
population centers . three plagues . the kurdish homeland begins above
biblical mount ararat and extends south in a long, mountainous loop to
the persian gulf (see map) . because of the accidents of history and
their own inability to unite, the estimated 6,000,000 kurds are today
divided among five different nations : the soviet union, turkey,
syria, iran and iraq . like the kurdish landscape, the kurdish
character has remained constant for thousands of years . many kurds are
tall, fair-skinned and blue-eyed . of life they ask little more than
flocks of broad-tailed sheep, a fine horse, a rifle with sufficient
cartridge bandoleers, and a woman who can bear strong sons . for
generations, the lowland arab has been terrorized by the mountain kurd
. an arab proverb says, " there are three plagues in the world : the
rat, the locust and the kurd . " the kurds reply, " a camel is not an
animal, and an arab is not a human being . " of iraq's 7,000,000
people, at least 1,500,000 are kurds . they live in the foothills of
the zagros mountains, and are divided into 22 major and 54 minor tribes
. unlike the arabs on the river plains, they are hard-working and full
of bounce . broad-shouldered mustafa barzani, 60, has spent most of his
adult life fighting for independence . after world war ii, with russian
backing, barzani became military boss of the soviet-inspired kurdish
people's republic in iran and, when it collapsed, was for twelve years
in exile in the soviet union . the younger brother of the ruling sheik
of the barzan tribe, barzani denies he is a communist, but echoes other
kurdish leaders who say that if war breaks out again the kurds will "
accept all the help we can get from anyone " russians included . shoot
on sight . at week's end, as their delegates still wrangled in baghdad,
both the kurdish rebels and the iraqi army prepared for the worst . the
government proclaimed a dusk-to-dawn curfew around northern iraq's
oilfields, pump stations, airfields, and military depots, warned that
violators would be " shot on sight . " iraqi troops blocked all roads
leading into the zagros mountains . nearly three-quarters of the army
was busy building concrete pillboxes and fortifications covering the
mountain passes . but during the cease-fire the kurds were not idle .
food has been stockpiled, arms replenished, and a standing army of
35,000 readied for battle, backed by a reserve of 100,000 . the rebels
are buttressed by scores of kurdish officers who deserted from the
iraqi army, and are linked by a network of 100 captured field radio
sets . but at week's end, the government called for more negotiations
and promised to reconsider kurdish demands . inturn, the kurds agreed
to hold up hostilities . " we don't want the responsibility for
starting the war again, " said a kurdish spokesman, " but we and the

police lines to loop garlands over the soldiers' necks, and children
scrambled up trees and statues . everyone screamed " marhab bil abtal

helicopters displayed military flags, and mig fighter squadrons
thundered past . the 3,000 troops, the first veterans to return home
from the seven-month civil war in yemen, formed up in republic square,
where president gamal abdel nasser mounted the dais, advanced to a
battery of microphones and cried : " o men ! faithful sons of your
nation, image of its heroes, vanguard of its march to freedom,
socialism and unity, you have witnessed on your way here the delight of
your nation over your victorious return ! " the soldiers clearly
shared the nation's delight, for even egypt's povertystricken villages
would look good after the harsh wilderness of yemen . nasser's
34-minute speech contained menace as well as hyperbole . he got down to
cases about his intentions in yemen, where, up till now, each returning
battalion has been replaced by an equal number of new egyptian levies .
egyptians would remain in yemen, he said, " until it is ascertained
beyond any shadow of a doubt, and beyond deception, that the
reactionary elements have, as a result of their defeat, contained their
rancor against the revolution . " he also sounded a warning to his
baath party rivals in syria, who had just purged their regime of
pro-nasser elements . but his words were curiously mild . during the
twelve days of nasser's trip to algeria and yugoslavia, radio cairo had
made the air waves blue with abuse of syria's baathist leaders . on his
return, nasser abruptly choked off the broadcast vituperation . he gave
a place of honor to a visiting syrian delegation during his republic
square speech and conferred lengthily with the syrians until their
quiet return to damascus at midweek . he had clearly decided that the
moment was not yet ripe for a showdown with baath leaders in both iraq
and syria, especially since the projected tri-state united arab
republic is still not formed . but the fight was not over, and if the
past was any guide, it would not be long before radio cairo was aiming
curses at the arabs who stand in the way of gamal abdel nasser .

turkey insurrection 22 as commandant of the ankara war college,
turkey's west point, colonel talat aydemir last year decided to treat
his cadets to a sort of after-hours seminar in current events . his
subject was the slow pace of government reform under premier ismet
inonu . to speed things up, aydemir, 43, a tough ex-artillery officer,
suggested that the lads support him in an armed rebellion against the
shaky inonu regime . but everyone flunked the final exam in
insurrection i an abortive coup led by aydemir in february 1962 that
fizzled out in six hours . teacher lost his job and his uniform, and
the cadets were disciplined . undaunted, former colonel aydemir, some
200 other ex-army officers and about 300 cadets last week tried
insurrection ii ; they flunked again . the revolt began shortly after
midnight when mutineers stormed the ankara radio station and broadcast
a declaration that the " revolutionary headquarters of the armed forces
/ was taking over the country . roused from their sleep, loyal army
troops raced to the scene, regaining control of the microphones
briefly, only to lose it once again to the insurgents . the claims and
counterclaims going out over the air waves were all very confusing to
the folks tuned in at home . in the distance, they could also hear the
rumble of tanks manned by rebel cadets, and the whoosh of government
air force f-100 jets that were spraying the rebels with machine-gun
fire from rooftop level . when at last it was clear that the
revolutionaries were clearly outgunned, aydemir, who had again donned
his colonel's uniform, raced for safety back to the war college . as
government troops threatened to level the building, he sneaked out a
back door, later was captured in a friend's home while changing back to
civilian clothes . the revolt was ended less than twelve hours after it
started . seven were dead and 26 others wounded, including aydemir's
successor as commandant of of the war college, who was shot in the leg
by his own cadets when he tried to persuade them to surrender .
arrested along with aydemir were about 20 other ex-officers accused as
ringleaders of the uprising . they will go on trial before a military
court, and most turks doubted that they will live long enough to try

angola bond of blood portuguese infantry patrols in northern
angola peered at the skies last week and waited prayerfully for the end
of the rains . in the third year of their campaign to quell a stubborn
native revolt against portuguese rule, government forces counted on dry
weather to throw armored units and paratroops against the african
guerrillas, who throughout the rainy season had mercilessly harassed
the bogged-down europeans . nonetheless, government troops this season
face tougher odds than ever before in the 2,000 sq . mi . battle zone,
known to the colonists as the rotten triangle . the rebels, admitted a
portuguese officer, have " tremendously " improved their tactics and
firepower in recent months . shuttling freely into angola from
congolese bases across the 400-mile northern border, wily terrorist
bands have replaced machetes and canhangulas, their crude, homemade
muzzle-loaders, with belgian mausers, u.s . carbines and czech machine
guns . and, unlike portugal's 50,000-man expeditionary force, they know
every inch of the terrain . says a longtime white administrator : " it
would take 100,000 men to clean up the triangle . " the rivals . the
bloody fight for angola is the only shooting war still raging in africa
. to win it and " liberate " the continent's biggest colonial
territory, african leaders in addis ababa last week vociferously
supported algerian premier ahmed ben bella's call to " establish a bond
of blood " with the angolan nationalists . the war is a grievous burden
for tiny portugal, which already has western europe's lowest living
standard . but strongman antonio de oliveira salazar, 74, is by now too
deeply committed to preservation of angola as a " province " of
portugal to yield the africans even token self-government without
imperiling his own 31-year reign in lisbon . despite the steady rise in
the guerrillas' strength and effectiveness, salazar's best hope of
victory lies in the bitter enmity between the two nationalist movements
that are struggling to win angola's independence . aid from mulattoes .
the rival rebel groups, both based across the border in the congolese
capital of leopoldville, often seem more intent on destroying each
other than the portuguese . the popular movement for liberation of
angola (m.p.l.a.) is led by smooth, sorbonne-educated mario pinto de
andrade, 34, a mulatto whose backing comes mainly from other
assimilados, the educated half-castes who have long had full portuguese
citizenship ; to widen its appeal, however, an angolan black, poet
agostinho neto, was recently made m.p.l.a.'s nominal leader . andrade,
who, like most of salazar's foes, is often denounced as a communist, is
an astute politician and an able organizer . he has built a nationwide
following among the mulatto elite who would be the logical leaders of
independent angola, and last week in addis ababa urged africa's
statesmen to help lance " the abscess of rivalry " between the two
movements . andrade's offer of cooperation was rejected by his
implacable foe, holden roberto, 38, a member of the far-flung bakongo
tribe, whose union of angolan peoples (u.p.a.) has powerful support
from the congo's premier cyrille adoula, roberto's longtime friend .
the u.p.a . has received aid from tunisia as well . with a training
camp near thysville, 40 miles from the congolese border, roberto's
guerrillas are the only militarily effective rebel group in angola,
though they have not succeeded in extending the conflict beyond the
triangle, where the bakongo and allied tribesmen are dominant . dy's
puppets . " nonetheless, roberto's u.p.a . has fought off insurgents
from andrade's movement . this month, at a makeshift hospital in
leopoldville, three young, algerian-trained m.p.l.a . fighters told a
grim tale of an ambush at the loge river, deep inside the triangle, in
which roberto's men massacred the rest of their 14-man guerrilla unit .
the u.p.a . leader is just as fiercely determined to resist
intervention from any other quarter . to algeria's offer of 10,000
volunteers to fight in angola, roberto snapped : " we will kill them
if they show up . we are nobody's puppets . " roberto, who promises a "
big move soon, " is expected to open a second front in the rich,
cotton-growing malange area, where a savage native uprising was stamped
out in 1961 . with the congo's katanga province now under
leopoldville's control, the anti-portuguese rebels could start moving
in through angola's " back door " as well . roberto has reason to be
confident . it took the french five years and 500,000 troops to achieve
even a stalemate in algeria . portugal is hard pressed to field
onetenth as many men . but lisbon and leopoldville may soon have little
say in the war . the governments of egypt, ghana, guinea and algeria
last week reached broad agreement on a plan to funnel equal aid to
mario pinto de andrade's m.p.l.a . and holden roberto's group . in
angola the portuguese themselves have become increasingly skeptical of
salazar's ability to suppress the rebellion . hard-bitten portuguese
colonists, many of whom were born in angola, have already organized
their own paramilitary volunteer corps to fight the guerrillas and, if
necessary, to wage an o.a.s.-style campaign to preserve white supremacy
in angola . " this is our war, " vowed one grimfaced plantation owner
last week . " we'll all be killed rather than move out . /

israel the man without enemies to the ceremonial blare of a ram's
horn, israel's third president was sworn into office last week . he was
schneor zalman shazar, 73, a balding, bespectacled scholar of jewish
history . the country's first minister of education, he was elected by
the knesset to fill the vacancy caused by the death of izhak ben-zvi
last month . russian-born shazar emigrated to palestine via central
europe during the '20s, was hand-picked for the job by an old
political crony, premier david ben-gurion . shazar has another
important qualification . as ben-gurion puts it, he is " a man without
enemies . " normally soft-spoken, shazar is an impassioned, skillful
orator when he gets onto a speaker's platform . during last month's
commemoration of the warsaw ghetto uprising, shazar brought the
audience to tears simply by repeating the word " warsaw " in hushed
tones before beginning his address ; on another occasion he was so
carried away by his own oratory that he fell off the stage and had to
be taken to the hospital for a badly sprained leg . shazar is also
notoriously absent-minded . years ago in poland, the story goes, he
boarded a train only to find that he had lost his rail ticket . assured
by the conductor that he could buy another, shazar replied : " i know,
but if i don't find the ticket i won't know where i'm going . /
shazar's original surname was
rubashov, but like many veteran zionists, he hebraized his name . david
green became david ben-gurion ; isaac shimshelevitz became izhak
ben-zvi . schneor zalman rubashov became shazar by combining the
initials of his first, middle and last names . an exception to the
common practice : israel's first president, who remained chaim

indonesia present & future it has been a month of hatred in
indonesia . more than 500 shops in bandung were wrecked in a single
daykabumi, youthful rioters hurled six automobiles over a precipice .
fistfights were common in dozens of other towns and villages . the ugly
violence has one common denominator : all the victims were chinese,
that minority of 3,000,000 among indonesia's 97 million which by hard
work and nimble brain has extracted wealth from the overheated,
forested archipelago of president sukarno . the racial bitterness beats
even birmingham, for despite repeated government efforts to crack their
economic power, the chinese sometimes operating through middlemen to
circumvent official sanctions still control trade, agriculture, small
industry, the black market and other forms of commerce . " go into even
the smallest village in indonesia, " an indonesian army officer once
complained, " and you will find one man whose house has electric lights
and a refrigerator . that man will be chinese . " we are hungry . "
there is nothing new in indonesia's prejudice, since the overseas
chinese have been running things there for years . but feeling against
the chinese has risen higher as indonesia has slid toward the brink of
economic ruin . inflation is out of control ; banknotes in circulation
have doubled in the past year, and the u.s . dollar, officially pegged
at 45 rupiahs, now gets 1,500 rupiahs on the black market . a good
sarong costs a worker three months' pay, and one indonesian airline
pilot has complained that he can make ends meet only by smuggling in
cameras from hong kong . governmentsubsidized schoolbooks are too
expensive for some students . there are periodic rice shortages, and
production of rubber, copra, and tin on expropriated dutch estates has
declined sharply under the management of fumbling government
bureaucrats . students have staged demonstrations with banners
screaming : " we are hungry . " resentment against the rich, well-fed
chinese minority finally exploded after a fistfight between an
indonesian student and a chinese student at bandung's institute of
technology . when a youthful rioter was shot by police in one town,
mobs with bamboo clubs herded chinese from their houses and made them
bow their heads as his funeral procession passed by . firing over the
heads of a screaming throng in bandung, police brought down a power
line which electrocuted two indonesians . prone to enjoy . predictably,
indonesia's president sukarno blamed neither himself nor his chaotic
economic policies for the riots, said that they were caused by "
counter-revolutionaries trying to capitalize on the food and clothing
situation and on the chinese minority problem . " he went right ahead
with plans to squeeze out western oil companies, though in the process
he risked losing the source of onethird of his nation's total export
earnings . not one to be disturbed long by mere economic questions,
sukarno was more interested in tenure . so as to be able to cope with
any future disorders, he had his rubber stamp congress " appoint " him
to the presidency for life . " this decision might not entirely live up
to certain constitutional requirements, " harrumphed an indonesian
cabinet minister, " but it should be remembered that it is a political
revolutionary product and not a legalistic product . " with his
continued career thus assured, sukarno flew off for what was described
as a long rest in japan, belgrade, vienna, rome, and france, which he
is always prone to enjoy . at sukarno's stop in tokyo last week, the
buss was waiting at the airport in the form of three delectable things

the last remaining neutralist toe holds on the plateau, as well as on
the headquarters of neutralist army leader general kong le at muong

canada, which was set up to police laotian neutrality, tried to restore

its icc representative to warsaw in the wake of vigorous u.s . protests
that the pole's " obstructionist tactics " and deliberate boycott of
icc field observation work were sabotaging efforts to maintain a
cease-fire between the neutralists and the pathet lao . as the sporadic
artillery duel continued, neutralist premier souvanna phouma
desperately tried to get his pro-communist half-brother, pathet lao
leader prince souphanouvong, to agree to a resumption of truce talks .

russia sin along with sig to some of the younger staffers in
britain's moscow embassy, smooth, charming sigmund mikhailski was
living proof that a communist needn't be a cad . an interpreter,
smiling sig was hired in 1954 and soon made himself a regular man
friday around the chancery offices on sofiiskaya quay . when no one
else could get bolshoi ballet tickets, sig did . he was equally
skillful at producing hard-to-get goodies, or black-marketing their
clothes or western currency for a handsome profit . he always went out
of his way to help the lonely ones, showed them the sights, even took
them to restaurants where they invariably met russians who seemed not
at all afraid to talk freely with westerners . older embassy hands were
skeptical about sig, knowing that he was probably a soviet spy . after
all, local help in moscow must be hired from u.p.d.k., the government
personnel agency for foreign employers of the embassy fired sig, they
reasoned, he would probably only be replaced by another spy who might
be a bounder to boot . in any case, the younger britons, who invited
him to their parties and went to his, knew that all his friends were
attached to western embassies, and felt certain that he hated the
russians . " you see, " explained sig, " i'm a pole . " he made a
determined pass at every new english girl he met and at the boys as
well . when they resisted, he explained mournfully that life in moscow
was hard on a passionate pole . unusual happenings . alas, poor sig !
one day in 1956, after nearly five years at the embassy, the british
suddenly fired him . not without cause . sig's saga finally came to
light last week in a remarkably bland report by the judicial tribunal
that has spent three months investigating the latest british spy
scandal : the strange case of william john vassall, a homosexual
admiralty clerk who had been assigned to the moscow embassy for two
years, and had been spying for the russians for seven . vassall's
superiors, and all but one of the officers who picked him out of 40
applicants for the moscow assignment, were exonerated by the tribunal,
which judged him " weak " but not overtly queer . however, admitted the
report, vassall's young colleagues in the moscow embassy ridiculed his
/ effeminate " ways and called him " vera . " the passionate pole soon
guessed his secret, and life began anew for vera vassall . eager to
share his new conquest, sig introduced vassall to other gay types . " i
shall never forget, " vassall wrote to an older man in london, " the
many unusual and extraordinary happenings that go on here, which must
come to few people . " he did not apparently regard it as too unusual
when one of his new russian friends photographed him in the act one
evening . it was not until vassall was caught redhanded with a soviet
officer that russian secret police intervened and explained to him the
gravity of his offense . when they threatened to show the compromising
photographs to lady hayter, wife of the ambassador, vassall agreed to
provide them with the classified embassy documents they wanted .
manufactured compromise . during his years at the british embassy, said
the tribunal's report, sig tried to blackmail three other britons for
black-marketing, got at least two members of other western embassies
involved in homosexual activities ; all these victims were hustled
home by their governments after refusing to spy for him . sig also
tried his best to seduce a female secretary in the british embassy, but
she guessed his aim and reported him . still sig stayed on . " the
manufacture of compromising situations, " concluded the judges' report
last week, " must be regarded as one of the regular instruments by
which the soviet secret service seeks to suborn and enlist british
agents who can furnish it with our state secrets . " thus was britain's
security system warned about soviet sigmunds . but would it ever get
wise to british veras ?

kenya the return of burning spear in dazzling sunlight last
week, 30,000 singing, dancing africans gathered before nairobi's
ministry of works . a great roar went up as two solemn men emerged .
one was kenya's british governor malcolm macdonald . the other, wearing
his customary leather jacket and beaded beanie, was burly jomo ( "
burning spear " ) kenyatta, the man who served seven years in jail as
the convicted " manager " of the mau mau terrorists, and who only three
years ago was denounced by the previous governor as " the leader to
darkness and death . " lifted bible . as if to brush away the bitter
past, macdonald told the crowd that this was a " glad day in kenya's
history " and wished kenyatta ('every success in his task of leading
kenya forward to uhuru (freedom) . " kenyatta echoed the cry of uhuru,
then, lifting a bible high in his right hand, he took the oath of
office as prime minister of self-governing kenya . jomo kenyatta made
the giant step from prisoner to prime minister with the help of his
kanu (kenya african national union) party, which last week won a
landslide victory in kenya's national elections, capturing 66 of 117
seats in the house of representatives, and 19 of 41 seats in the senate
. kenyatta not only defeated ronald ngala's rival kadu (kenya african
democratic union) and paulngei's african peoples party, but also dealt
skillfully with the clever kanu rivals below him who have been hoping
to be named as kenyatta's heir apparent . they are tom mboya, 32, the
bright, able and ruthless labor leader who leads a moderate faction
inside kanu, and communist-leaning oginga odinga, 52, who wears a blue
mao tse-tung-style workingman's uniform . kenyatta moved promptly to
secure a proper balance in his new administration, handed almost equal
cabinet posts to the two contenders : mboya was named minister of
justice and constitutional affairs, and odinga was given the
potentially powerful home affairs ministry . against all predictions,
kenyatta named no one at all as vice premier . no congo . kenyatta has
mellowed with age, imprisonment, and repeated marriages (he has had
four wives, three of whom survive, as do seven children and four
grandchildren) . in nairobi last week he said flatly : " kenya is not
going to be another congo . " as for the future of the 55,000 whites
living nervously among kenya's 8,000,000 africans, kenyatta says that
the white man " will be protected as any other citizen in kenya is
protected . he will have the right to own property . he will be equal
to every other citizen . " under the compromise constitution worked out
last year in london, britain was to retain control of defense, foreign
affairs and internal security . but last week, presumably impressed by
kenyatta's moderate words, britain's macdonald disclosed that all three
would be transferred to the new government, and complete independence
may well be won by the first of the year . a high british official in
nairobi expressed guarded optimism : " it's much more promising than i
expected . more and more european settlers have decided to remain in
kenya, and i think their view is justified . of course, tribalism could
muck it all up . but with a little luck, i think kenya can gradually

power minister hafiz mohammed ibrahim with little difficulty . the
defeat was doubly galling for nehru, for ibrahim's campaign was

china's newest folk hero . otherwise celebrated as the forever
rustproof screw, young communist lei feng soared to posthumous fame
when party officials conveniently discovered a200,000-word diary that
established him as the confucius of collectivism . by contrast with the
vast majority of china's peasants, whose reluctance to be herded into
agricultural communes in 1958 has been largely responsible for the
nation's persistent food shortages, lei feng actually waxed lyrical
over such selfless, soulless " service to the people . " said he : "
one's role in the revolutionary cause is just like a screw in the
machine . a man has his greatest strength only when he is merged with
the collective . " with a marked improvement in food supplies this
spring, the government has mounted a massive " learn from lei feng "
propaganda campaign, in an effort to halt what ideologists call the
peasants' " spontaneous tendency toward capitalism . " to the dismay of
enterprising peasants, the government started cutting down on the
minute private plots that they have been allowed to cultivate and to
use as a source of independent income . it seemed illogical, since it
was the incentive that helped boost farm production in the first place
. nevertheless, in kiangsi province, radio nanchang exhorts daily : "
the collective must come before private plots . " at a commune in
kwangtung province, where peasants used to have to supply the
collective with 33 lbs . of human ordure a month, their quota has been
boosted to 55 lbs., thus limiting the only fertilizer available for
freelance farming . as an added turn of the screw, production quotas
for collective output have been sharply increased, in hopes that the
peasants will have to spend more time working for mao tse-tung and less
for tsu-fa, meaning " self-prosperity . " the government campaign may
well fizzle, as it did in 1958 . says one expert on china's agriculture
: " in the debris of the great leap forward, compulsion cannot work .
all that is left is persuasion . " most peasants are convinced
nonetheless that they are in for a far more rigorous existence ; many

of the 144-member house of representatives . things did not work out as
planned . semiofficial results last week confirmed that hassan's party

nine cabinet ministers running for the house under the king's banner
lost their races, and the two opposition parties, the nationalist
istiqlal and the left-leaning national union of popular forces, showed
startling strength, winning 43 and 28 seats respectively . if they
ganged up in a coalition, the two groups might be able to control the
house . steamed up by their new prestige, opposition leaders were

dissolved and boldly accusing the government of fraud at the polls .

achieve without losing royal face . or he could declare a " recount "

monarch . using the constitution he drafted last year, hassan could

were posted outside his hotel room . the bavarian took the commotion in
stride . after all, he admitted, " the past lies like a shadow between

communist party filed a complaint demanding the german's arrest for war
crimes allegedly committed when strauss was a young lieutenant and
battery commander at a german antiaircraft school near the end of world
war ii . strauss retorted that he had never been in charge of a

holy land historical sites, spent one night at a kibbutz (cooperative
farm) . en route, he promised to press for the establishment of
diplomatic relations between west germany and israel, and to try to bar
west german scientists from working for israel's archenemy, egypt .

great
britain 2 on the fence with mlf field marshal viscount montgomery of
alamein has his own ideas about the u.s . proposal for a nato fleet of
polaris-firing surface ships manned by crews of several nationalities .
/ utter and complete poppycock ! " he cried in the house of lords
last week . " how, " he snorted, " can a ship fight effectively if
one-third of its crew is portuguese, one-third belgian and one-third,
say, danish .? the thing is just not on . you might as well man a
ship with a party of politicians . " many british politicians and
military experts share montgomery's mistrust of the multilateral force
(mlf) and its sponsor the u.s . indeed, though prime minister harold
macmillan nominally agreed at nassau last december to support the nato
force, his government has been hoping ever since that mlf would quietly
capsize of its own complexity . naughty questions . the british approve
of its primary aim, to satisfy west germany's demand for a bigger role
in nato's nuclear defense, but argue that they cannot afford to build
their own independent polaris submarine fleet and contribute as well to
mlf, whose 20 to 25 ships are expected to cost $5 billion over a
ten-year period . thanks to washington's success in selling mlf to
germany and then to italy, it seemed at first as if the fleet might be
built with only a token contribution from britain . however, when aldo
moro took over as italy's premier-designate last month, washington
realized that his fragile government is in no position to honor its
commitment to shoulder mlf's cost, or even to participate . thus the
u.s ., which has promised to contribute 40 per cent, and persuaded
the germans to pledge another 40 per cent , has finally put pressure on
britain . to whitehall's dismay, washington announced its top mlf
expert, admiral claude ricketts, deputy chief of naval operations,
would fly to london this week to discuss the government's technical
reservations and satisfy british complaints that they have so far
received nothing but " computer answers " from the pentagon . said one
british official gleefully : " we've got a lot of naughty questions .
/ compelling logic . britain's main objection to mlf is that it is
primarily a " political " scheme to promote nato solidarity . however,
if britain decides not to support mlf, it faces one of two unpalatable
alternatives . either the project will be abandoned, with the
likelihood that the germans and other european nations will ultimately
develop their own nuclear weapons ; or the force will come into being
anyway, and in time may develop into a truly european deterrent,
exclusive of britain . in either case, britain might seriously strain
its ties with the u.s . by refusing to participate . recalling that
only a few years ago the government argued with compelling logic
against membership in the common market, the sunday telegraph concluded
last week : " what is so sad is that once again we seem to be climbing
reluctantly into a back seat on the bandwagon only after it has started
to move . /

great britain lots of loot in british movies, crime usually pays
handsomely at least if the crook is a dear old crank whose only motive
is to raise some lolly for the league against cruel sports . in real
life, larceny is even more lucrative for the professional who
specializes in the sophisticated jobs that the english call "
yankee-style " crime . robberies alone have soared by more than 200 per
cent (to some $5,000,000 yearly) in metropolitan london over the past
decade, while payroll thefts have gone up almost 500 per cent since
1960 . chief reason for the increase in " snatchings and rakings, " as
scotland yard calls them, is that the underworld is now managed by
executives with a flair for organization that outstrips the sleuths .
they also have style . in the past year one gang has made frequent
headlines by knowledgeable thefts of priceless silver from stately
homes, whose doughty walls, it seems, scarcely quiver when burglars
blast open the pantry safe . one victim, the marquess of bristol,
learned recently that $56,000 worth of silver pinched from his mansion
last february is now in russia . another underworld spectacular that
fascinated britons was carried out last year by eight dapper dastards
in bowler hats, and dark suits and carrying tightly furled umbrellas,
who marched into london airport, grabbed a $175,000 airline payroll,
and beat an elegant retreat in two matching blue jaguars . last week
britons could talk of little else but a cool little coup in which four
men swiped a half-ton of gold from a financial-district bullion
warehouse in the lunch hour . after tying up a watchman, the villains
nonchalantly lugged forty 27-lb . gold bars worth $560,000 across a
sidewalk into a blue delivery van, then made a clean getaway despite a
traffic-stopping dash the wrong way on a one-way street . hoping to
keep the culprits from leaving the country, scotland yard posted men at
every airfield and seaport in britain . flying-squad officers checked
every small foundry in london on the off-chance that they might nab the
gang in the act of melting their haul into easily portable nuggets . at
week's end the new lavender hill mob, as fleet street inevitably
christened it, was still at large probably, guessed scotland yard,
holed up within metropolitan london . unlike alec guinness' mob, which
melted down its loot into sold-gold eiffel tower souvenirs and shipped
them to paris, the real-life quartet probably aimed to export its
bullion to india, where gold fetches twice the world market price . " i
see no reason why they should be caught, " said one expert . " they
have a market for it all ready . it's that kind of job . /

france warning to les flics to foreign tourists, the paris cop
seems a model of quiet courtesy . he directs them to american express

traffic with a calm nonchalance . frenchmen look on le flic quite
differently . apart from their dislike of taking orders from anyone,
they know that frequently in the hem of his natty blue cape is sewn
enough buckshot to break a man's and sometimes a woman's nose . they
have seen him wading into a crowd flailing a 6-ft . riot cane like a
scythe . parisians recall many bloody heads across the years,
especially the nine people killed in the crush when police broke up a
1962 peace rally . but the latest uproar began in april, when
cinemactor jean-paul (breathless) belmondo dared to protest that a cop
was neglecting an accident victim while quizzing witnesses ; belmondo
was knocked flat . during may, four prisoners detained for trifling
offenses hanged themselves in their cells . there was no evidence to
prove that the police were at fault, but no one could convince
suspicious frenchmen that the deaths were not caused by third-degree
tactics . paris has also gotten a little tired of the overzealous use
of submachine guns issued during the past algerian terrorist outbreaks
. when a panther escaped from a circus, a flic mistook a shadow for the
beast and in error plugged a passer-by . another ludicrously chopped up
a cow, broken loose from a slaughterhouse, with his tommy gun . with
newspaper headlines growing ever more critical, public animosity became

minister roger frey last week called top police officials together and
spoke some harsh words . he told them " to orient their essential
activities toward their traditional job . " / your action will
contribute most to the public peace, " frey upbraided them, " when it
is carried out with humanity, sang-froid, tact and courtesy, with
unrelenting care for the respect of human beings . this requires not a
little urbanity in relations with the public . " whether the cops
really cared to improve their public image was open to question ; the
tradition of stern authoritarianism is deeply rooted . the paris force
dates back to the days of augustus caesar and assumes the role of a
state, rather than municipal, police . until the recent criticism, they
could hold a suspect up to two weeks without explanation . they still
issue passports, license everything from prostitution to driving, and
keep close track of the whereabouts of everybody in paris . will the

russia meet comrade punkovsky there was no applause from the
crowd that jammed a tennis court in southwest moscow's luzhniki sports
grounds . in the biggest trial of its kind ever held in the soviet
capital, 2,000 muscovites met at the stadium as a people's court to
pass judgment on three " young, healthy fellows " who were accused of
having " wasted their youth " on drunken sprees, gambling, and black
market dealings with foreigners . after the citizens voted unanimously
to banish the wastrels from moscow, all three were sentenced to five
years' hard labor in what the authorities delicately called " a remote
part of the country . " the trial, which was front-page news in pravda,
was staged as part of a new soviet campaign to make life harder for
western spies and duller for communist partygoers . since last month's
trial and execution of oleg penkovsky, the scientific official who was
convicted of slipping secret information to british and u.s . agents,
the soviet press has been urging comrades to " break the criminal chain
of espionage " by showing " revolutionary vigilance and being
ideologically well-steeled . " russians were particularly warned
against moscow's diplomatic cocktail circuit, where, said pravda
darkly, western spymasters recruit new talent . warned pravda : " that
was how they got hold of penkovsky, and the same thing may happen to
anyone who, in his blindness, nibbles at the bait the imperialists so
lavishly toss out . " izvestia chimed in with an acid-etched portrait
of the kind of comrade the imperialists are looking for . dubbing him "
punkovsky " for punk izvestia reported that this unsavory type
cherishes a neverending stream of gold-embossed invitations to
diplomatic receptions, where he can be spotted by his " empty phrases
and full glass . " he is the sort of man who, when benny goodman visits
moscow, carries his clarinet case . those old pants he wears so proudly
were bestowed on him by a british traveling salesman . " give me a tie
and some socks, " punkovsky tells a western cultural attache, " and
i'll introduce you to some of moscow's angry young men . " the soviet
people are not inclined to see a spy in every foreigner, " officials
insisted . nonetheless, they warned, if foreign diplomats and newsmen
continue to invite punkovskys and penkovskys to their parties, " real,
honest soviet people " might boycott them altogether . to show that its
diatribes were not just cocktail talk, the government last week
stripped artillery chief marshal sergei varenstov of his rank for
having befriended penkovsky, disciplined some of " the scientist's
other friends and boozing companions . " / of course, " added pravda, "

belgium 2-12 lingua belgica in charleroi, the walloon banners screamed
/ no to a flemish dictatorship ! " an orator in flanders shouted, "
we reject all further compromises ! " the angry shouts over much of
belgium last week were the latest outbursts in the ancient hostility
between the nation's 5,250,000 dutch-speaking flemings in the north and
the 4,000,000 french-speaking walloons in the south . since belgium
seceded from the netherlands 133 years ago, the numerically superior
flemings have always resented the traditional economic and social
superiority of the walloons . " we're the only country in europe with
an oppressed majority, " says belgium's flemish premier theo lefevre .
lefevre was overstating the case . since the end of world war ii,
flanders has capitalized on a healthy dollop of u.s . aid to
industrialize and acquire a patina of prosperity, while wallonia, with
its played-out coal mines, has been plagued by chronic
unemployment.last year, when violent riots broke out between the two
factions, the flemish majority in parliament passed a law dividing
belgium into two separate unilingual sections along a line extending
from the german border south of aachen to the french frontier ; to the
north, flemish would be the official language in schools, courts and
administrative offices ; to the south, only french would be recognized
. the compromise was a failure, and last week demonstrations broke out
in brussels and louvain, both of which are north of the line and both
of which have always been accorded a measure of bilingual status . at
louvain university, walloon professors and students went out on strike,
boycotting lectures and classes in protest over the proposed bilingual
split of the traditionally french-speaking university . in an attempt
to solve the explosive situation, premier lefevre called for a two-week
/ language armistice " while his government tried to work out another
compromise . but with parliament split along language lines, there was
little hope of a solution . unless flemings and walloons learn to live
with each other, said one deputy in parliament last week, " i can only
conclude that in a small country live small people . /

south viet nam the makeshift killers into the
valley of death last week flew the 800 . they were south vietnamese
troops being lifted by a company of u.s . h-21 troop-carrying
helicopters to clean out a communist-infested jungle hideout 175 miles
northeast of saigon . the region was a tangled, menacing battleground,
whose name, like tennyson's balaclava, derives from its bloody history
in south viet nam's ugly guerrilla war . as each flight dipped into the
tiny landing zone, an escort of twelve rocketcarrying uh 1-b ( " huey "
) choppers sprayed the scrubby underbrush with rockets and machine-gun
fire . not a single hostile shot was returned as the troops hit the
ground and fanned into the jungle . the absence of enemy opposition in
the landing area could be largely traced to viet cong fear of the
rocket-carrying hueys . before their arrival in south viet nam last
fall, devastating communist ground fire against the lumbering,
defenseless h-21s threatened to halt the government's helicopter
airlift campaign, which had been the most effective offensive tactic
against the red guerrillas . reluctantly the top u.s . military brass,
which had long been skeptical that a helicopter could ever be a deadly
offensive weapon, threw the newlyarrived hueys into combat . their
mission : to escort and protect the troopcarrying copters . " the most
essential unit . " so effective have the hueys been in counteracting
viet cong ground fire that some h-21 pilots have refused to carry out
missions rather than fly without huey escorts . since last october, the
hueys have flown 3,600 sorties, fired 1,800 rockets and 200,000 rounds
of machinegun ammunition, and killed countless hundreds of reds . two
enlisted men of the company (whose official military designation is
utility tactical transport company) have been killed in combat, and 19
other members of the 113-man unit have been awarded the distinguished
flying cross . today u.s . military officials estimate that, although
the viet cong has doubled its antiaircraft effort in the past year, the
troop-carrying choppers are suffering 25 per cent fewer hits than
before the hueys arrived on the viet nam scene . " the hueys, " says
general paul harkins, the capable boss of the 14,000 u.s . advisers in
south viet nam, " are the most essential unit in my command . " the
irony of the hueys' success is that they are makeshift killers,
originally designed as utility aircraft and personnel carriers . but
huey pilots became convinced that their speedy, maneuverable choppers
would be ideal support aircraft in the kind of guerrilla war situation
that southeast asia presents . on their own, company personnel
outfitted their hueys with 16 homemade rocket mounts and four
machine-gun brackets, pestered dubious brass for months to let them try
out their ideas in action . the hueys' effectiveness is mainly the
result of their ability to chug right along in the same formation with
the h-21s . unlike fixed-wing fighter bombers, which fly too high and
too fast to pick out specific targets and sometimes drop napalm on
innocent civilians, the slowcruising hueys can spot ground fire in the
landing zone and move in to neutralize it with discriminating fire that
spares noncombatants . " if we kill one woman or a child on a mission
and 90 viet cong, " says one huey pilot, " then that mission is a
failure . " psychological effect . as a previously untried combat
innovation, the hueys can afford to experiment in heliborne assault
tactics, are providing the army with invaluable operational experience
in new doctrines of guerrilla warfare . " we're writing the book of
tactics ourselves, " says major ivan slavich, 35, commanding officer of
the u.t.t . company . in combat, the hueys usually fly a circular "
daisy chain " pattern so that each ship is always covered by the
chopper immediately behind it . " our machine guns have more actual
killing power, " says slavich . " but our rockets seem to have a much
greater psychological effect on the viet cong . /
the makeshift killers with their maneuverability, the hueys
can slide back and forth just a few feet over the sun-scorched rice
fields, sorting out their targets like cowboys cutting steers from a
herd . on one recent mission, the desperate reds tried to lob hand
grenades into the open side doors of the low-circling choppers . when
two hueys tried to box in and capture a fleeing red guerrilla, he
suddenly wheeled and headed straight for them, a hand grenade in each
hand . a burst of gunfire from the choppers cut him down ; both
grenades exploded beneath his body . from the door of a grass hut, a
guerrilla blazed away at a hovering huey, missed its copilot by only a
few inches . the huey's wingman planted a rocket smack in the doorway
of the hut and blew it to pieces . scared princess . the chopper pilots
credit slavich for the outstanding success of the hueys, call their
outfit " slavich's people . " son of a retired san francisco democratic
ward politician, slavich served as a marine corps enlisted man after
world war ii, became an army officer after graduation from the
university of san francisco in 1951 . he won a combat infantryman's
badge in korea, became a pilot in 1955, took command of the u.t.t .
company last november . slavich runs an easygoing outfit at his base at
the edge of saigon airport . like tourists, some pilots tote cameras on
missions, and slavich himself used to take his german shepherd,
princess, along on sorties until the pup became so shell-shy that she
nearly jumped out of the chopper when the rockets were fired . the
pilots have a jargon of their own . they " zap " the viet cong on a
good day, call saigon " the ville, " express fervent approval of
everything from a girl to a chopper with the word " outstandin' . "
top-ranking visitors often hitch rides on their flights to get in a few
personal licks at the viet cong . brigadier general joseph stilwell
jr., son of " vinegar joe, " frequently rides shotgun in slavich's own
chopper . once, with stilwell aboard, slavich had to make an emergency
landing in a red-infested area . " i was scared to death, " said
slavich . glad the viet cong didn't come along, because i know damn
well that general stilwell would have made us fight for the machine
instead of letting us run . " / pucker up & pray . " deadly as the
hueys are, they have their faults . as both doors must be kept wide
open to give the automatic rifle-toting side gunners complete
visibility, the blast of the rockets creates an ear-shattering din in
the copter's cabin . even worse, the hueys are virtually unarmored, and
enemy flak cuts through them easily . all four crewmen not only wear
flak vests but also sit on a pile of vests to protect private parts . "
when an enemy is shooting at you at that low altitude, it's the most
hopeless feeling in the world, " says one pilot . " there's nothing to
do but pucker up and pray . " but because of the hueys' performance,
the army is now encouraging the design of a much better, armored,
attack helicopter, which might achieve speeds of 175 knots and employ
heavier machine guns and permanently installed turrets for the lethal
rockets . from major slavich comes the rationale for such an aircraft .
/ we can stay in the same environment as the helicopters we are
protecting, " he said . " we can work in close, we can work in
unlimited visibility, we can vary our airspeed from 100 knots to zero .
we can seek and find a hostile menace to helicopters better than anyone
else . /

great britain the price of christine what the hell is
going on in this country ? shouted the daily mirror . as if anyone
didn't know . what went on was just the kind of story on which the
mirror thrives . although it had started out
merely as venery in high (and
several low) places, it grew into a major scandal that not only smashed
the career of a promising tory politician, but also raised some
troubling questions about british security and rocked the macmillan
government . otherwise, it read like la dolce vita, anglo-saxon style .
the story first emerged partially last march, when its leading
characters became publicly identified : red-haired christine keeler,
who came from middlesex to sling hash at 17, and at 21 was the west
end's most-called girl ; john profumo, 48, the able war minister and
man-about-mayfair, whose virile charm proved something of a tory asset
after those homosexual spy scandals ,; and dr . stephen ward, 43, a
social osteopath (and son of the anglican canon of rochester
cathedral), who said he liked helping attractive girls of humble birth
adapt to " the needs and stresses of modern living . " after months of
rumor, a labor m.p . challenged the government to deny the rumors of a
minister's indiscretions with christine . profumo's firm denial of
wrongdoing, and a demonstration of support from prime minister
macmillan, quashed the story temporarily until it burst forth again
last week . this time profumo resigned from the government after an
abrupt, abject confession that he had previously lied to the prime
minister, his colleagues and the house of commons . coexistence . of
noble italian descent, john dennis profumo had every qualification to
reach the tories' top ranks : harrow and oxford, fine war record,
brains, drive, and a beautiful wife, movie actress valerie (great
expectations) hobson . together, the profumos were weekending at
cliveden, famed country estate of lord and lady astor, when they were
introduced to christine in 1961 . also present : stephen ward, who had
a cottage on the place . thereafter, valerie stayed home while jack
visited christine at ward's flat in wimpole mews . what the war
minister never knew was that christine had another regular visitor,
evgeny ivanov, who was a soviet naval attache in london . a round-eyed
observer of their coexistence was nymphet marilyn ( " mandy " )
rice-davies, a well-developed 16-year-old, who was one of christine's
intimates . " the farcical thing about it all, " as mandy told the
press, " was that, on more than one occasion, as jack left christine at
the flat, ivanov walked in . " it possibly seemed less hilarious to
british mi-5 intelligence agents, who were shadowing ivanov at the
time, to find that their war minister was unwittingly sharing a bed
with a suspected soviet spy .
the price of christine though they tried not to be seen in
public, profumo sometimes took christine for drives, she later recalled
. " he showed me the war office, where he worked . he even showed me
downing street . " but in time profumo stopped seeing christine
because, she explained, he was " scared it would ruin his career . "
comrade ivanov was shipped off to moscow, and the " model " from
middlesex, who had acquired a taste for jazz on the way up, hit the
blues belt and acquired a jamaican lover named johnnie edgecombe . but
he could never understand what her telephone was for . " he seemed to
think, " christine complained later, " that i was going to live with
him forever . " one day, johnnie showed up with a gun and fired several
bullets into the door before the bobbies bagged him . multiracialism .
after johnnie went to jail, there was another west indian lover,
aloysius " lucky " gordon, who, if anything, was even more narrowminded
. in april he beat her up . last week, at his trial for assault,
aloysius was so ungallant as to testify that he had kept her supplied
with marijuana, while all she gave him in return was vd . " you can say
this for christine, " said a leading labor politician . " at least
she's multiracial . " the scandal might have died, had it not been
resurrected by stephen ward himself . seven weeks after profumo's
denial, he told the prime minister's private secretary that the war
minister had lied in commons, that he had indeed had an affair with
christine keeler . ward repeated his charges in letters to home
secretary henry brooke and labor party leader harold wilson . profumo
was confronted with this new accusation, but it was not until last week
that he startled tory officials by blurting the truth about christine
in a letter to the vacationing prime minister, profumo resigned as
war minister and as m.p . for stratford-on-avon, confessing his " grave
misdemeanor . " said he : " i cannot tell you of my deep remorse . "
macmillan accepted his resignation, describing the affair as " a great
tragedy . " then profumo and his wife left their regent's park home and
disappeared into the country . dilemma . the scandal he left behind got
livelier every day . christine keeler, who was back from a continental
holiday and suddenly sported a " business manager " and a new
rolls-royce, added more off-color to the saga by telling and selling
her story to the papers . " i was very fond of jack, " she said
wistfully . " if ever we meet again, we have at least this in common
both our careers have been ruined . " mandy chimed in with details of
the high living that had earned her a jaguar, mink and diamonds by her
17th birthday . at one dinner party, she recalled, " a naked man
wearing a mask waited on table like a slave . he had to have a mask
because he was so well known . /
meanwhile stephen ward's explanations filled the newspapers and tv
screens . the affair, he protested, had given rise to " a whole train
of rumors, and all sorts of people were mentioned, with the implication
that i'd been trying to procure them for miss keeler . " despite his
subsequent attempt to protect profumo and the government, said ward, he
had reported profumo's liaison to british intelligence when it was at
its height in 1961 . said he : " i've almost had a nervous breakdown .
it's a terrible dilemma . one didn't want to bitch up anybody . you owe
it to your friends . but i must clear myself . " for the immediate
future, stephen ward will do his explaining in court . at week's end
scotland yard plucked the osteopath from his white jaguar sports car
and jailed him on charges of violating britain's sexual offenses act by
/ living wholly or in part on the earnings of prostitution . " unrest .
as a matter of political tactics, the labor party decided to treat the
profumo affair not so much as a moral indictment of uppercrust britain
but rather as another flagrant example of the erratic workings of
britain's security system . if, argued laborites, british intelligence
had known all along that britain's war minister had shared a call girl
with a soviet agent, why was nothing done to break up a liaison that
might expose him to russian blackmail ? was macmillan told ? if so,
had the government encouraged profumo to lie about his dalliance with
christine keeler solely in order to avert a damaging scandal ?
unflappable harold macmillan, who did not allow last week's events to
interrupt his golfing vacation, will be able to present the
government's case when parliament reconvenes next week . he may yet, as
in the past, confound his critics in commons . but the affair may
seriously affect the tories' already shaky chances at the next
elections, which macmillan will now probably try to delay . said tory
backbencher lord lambton : " the harm this will do to the conservative
party will be enormous . there has been for some time a general feeling
of unrest in this country as to the morality of the present government
. this feeling will be immensely increased . /

the allies three on a horse top british defense officials
listened politely in london last week while a u.s . navy task force
argued the merits of a missile-firing surface fleet manned by mixed
nato crews . the britons' real feelings toward the multilateral force
(mlf) were best expressed in a sardonic limerick that made the rounds
of whitehall : hooray for the multimixed force, german, british and
yankee, of course ! each produces a knight, and the plan is to fight
or deter with all three on one horse . behind u.s . efforts to sell mlf
was the ill-concealed fact that military washington does not really
believe in it either . privately the pentagon considers it at best a
gimmick to postpone " proliferation " of independent nuclear forces to
other nations, which it wants at all costs to prevent or delay . "
monstrous nonsense . " charged with the halfhearted mission of winning
british support for the $5 billion mlf was admiral claude ricketts, u.s
. deputy chief of naval operations, who has doubled of late as the
pentagon's multimixmaster . strategically, he argued, a force of 25
polaris vessels cruising europe's shallow coastal waters could not
easily be destroyed by soviet submarines or aircraft . said ricketts :
/ each additional weapons system enhances the credibility of other
systems " but r.a.f . marshal sir john slessor called it " monstrous
military nonsense, " and many other british defense officials agreed .
the state department's main justification for mlf is not military but
political . it is aimed primarily at satisfying west germany's demand
for an equal voice with britain and france in nato's nuclear councils,
and the germans are already pledged to match the u.s.'s offer to
shoulder 40 per cent of the cost . without british backing, however,
mlf will never get off the drawing board ; the u.s . is not willing to
share the financial and political responsibility with germany alone .
but the british, who are already committed to building a $1 billion
polaris submarine fleet by 1970, reply that they cannot afford to pour
more money into anything as theoretical as mlf . europe's most telling
objection to the project is that even if the allies did chip in,
ultimate control of its weapons would still rest with the u.s . who
needs it ? the kennedy administration hopes nonetheless to win
british as well as german support for the force . " we certainly don't
need it, " explained a high-ranking administration official last week,
/ nor do the europeans . but if it satisfies them, i think it is worth
pursuing . if it doesn't, well, at least we made the offer . " all this
merely obscured what ought to be the real u.s . policy an independent
nuclear force for a truly united europe ; 2) full u.s . responsibility
for the defense of europe until that goal is achieved .

a buffer between east and west . electrical workers went on a wildcat
strike, plunging one vienna district into darkness . left-wing papers
roared against " foreign and domestic reactionaries, " and socialist
political bosses threatened to pull out of their coalition with the
conservative people's party . industrious ants . otto was five when
austria rebelled against the habsburg monarchy and overthrew his
father, emperor karl, in the aftermath of world war i . the new
republican government exiled the royal family and passed a " habsburg
law, " which banned their return to austrian soil until they renounced
all claims to the throne and formally embraced the democratic
constitution . karl regally refused, and after his death in 1922 the
royal family settled in spain, where the empress zita set up a modest
court . zita insisted that otto be accorded the full privileges of his
rank, rose and curtsied when he entered a room, and called him " your
imperial highness . " a thoughtful, scholarly youth, otto studied at
belgium's louvain university, by his serious demeanor stood off
phalanxes of eligible european princesses . when one young, attractive
hungarian countess came to pay homage, otto strolled silently with her
for some minutes in his garden until he suddenly asked : " have you
ever thought how industrious ants are ? " finally in 1951, at 38, he
married germany's princess regina of saxemeiningen . settling outside
munich in the village of pocking, otto traveled often to spain, where
he was honorary president of the franco-backed european documentation
and information center, an organization founded in 1952 to bring
politically isolated spain into closer relations with the rest of
europe . his membership in this society and his friendship with franco
convinced austrian socialists that his ultimate aim was the
re-establishment of an autocratic monarchy in austria . " the idea
matters . " in his writing and lectures, otto sounded far from
autocratic, sought to define " monarchy's place in the atomic age . "
said he : " the new form of monarchy might well be elective from the
judiciary, perhaps . its primary duty would be the maintenance of the
rule of law . it is the idea that matters, not the people who once were
kings . " but otto had little sympathy with the leveling influences of
socialism . " we have arrived at a bureaucracy of welfare and insurance
against everything, which may well turn reason into nonsense, " he
wrote . " there is a danger of a new caste arising out of a classless
society those in power . " two years ago, otto suddenly announced his
willingness to abide by the provisions of the habsburg law and sought
to re-enter austria . but austria's coalition government, balanced
between the 81 parliamentary seats held by the conservative people's
party and the 76 seats held by the socialists, refused to act on the
petition in the face of vehement socialist protests that otto's
political ideas were " fantastic " and that his declaration of loyalty
was inadequate . otto's attorney took the case to the administrative
court, which fortnight ago upheld the legality of his declaration over
the government's rejection . pushbutton . the people's party, while far
from eager to see otto back home, was willing to abide by the court
ruling . not so the socialists . " this court has replaced the
parliamentary organ, " said socialist foreign minister bruno kreisky .
socialist leaders hinted a nationwide rail and electrical strike if
otto tried to cross the border into austria . " all we have to do, "
said kreisky, " is push a button . " in parliament, the socialists
joined with the eight-man delegation of the splinter right-wing liberal
party and forced a resolution demanding that the government prepare a
bill that could return ultimate judgment on all habsburg law cases to
parliament . the liberals lent their support to the socialists,
however, only on the condition that the bill not be retroactive and
that otto would not be barred from returning home. the crisis
imperiled the 18-year coalition between the people's party and the
socialists, who kept threatening to freeze out their old partners by
forming a new coalition with the liberals . even if the old coalition
survives, the betting was that enough trouble had been stirred up to
require new national elections soon . while most austrians retain
mellow feelings toward the habsburgs, they would just as soon not be
bothered by otto's problem . " why should we go back to where we
finished 40 years ago ? " asked helmut qualtinger, famed vienna
cabaret satirist . " i think that as a matter of taste, otto would not
want to come back not if he loves his country . /
also unsettled is
the question of the habsburg fortune in austria, which amounts to some
$30 million, mostly in estates . the lands are now held in trusteeship
by the austrian republic .

iran progress at a price for three days last week, teheran
was a battleground ; crowds shrieked, machine guns chattered, and
smoke from smoldering rubble mixed with clouds of tear gas .
ironically, it was a battle against progress . that most unusual,
reform-minded monarch, shah mohammed reza pahlevi has long struggled to
turn his shaky, feudal nation into a modern, stable state . the
opposition is formidable . corrupt bureaucrats and operators are
determined to preserve pishkash (a bribe) as a way of life . big
landlords try to sabotage the shah's ambitious land reform drive ;
they even opposed his intention to eliminate the word " serf " from the
iranian language (to be replaced by " farmer " ) . moslem mullahs
(priests) condemn as heretical his plans to give women the vote, and
more bitterly, preach from their pulpits against land reform, since it
would deprive them of 10,000 income-producing " shrine villages, "
which the shah wants to lease to landless sharecroppers . burning
bazaar . it was the mullahs who triggered last week's trouble . they
timed their plans to coincide with the muharram holy days . as the
faithful jammed the mosques, the mullahs assailed " illegal " cabinet
decisions, urged their followers to " protect your religion . "
small-scale riots quickly broke out in the clerical capital of qum, led
by ayatullah (roughly, cardinal) rouhollah khomaini, and in several
other cities . police struck back, arrested khomaini and some 15 other
ringleaders . with that, both sides declared open war, and the battle
was on . screaming " down with the shah, " 10,000 barefoot,
black-shirted moslems, joined by thousands of armed toughs for hire,
swept through the capital, carrying pictures of khomaini . though the
whereabouts of the shah was kept secret, rows of white-helmeted troops,
backed by tanks, immediately sealed off access to royal palaces in the
city and suburbs . in the heart of town, green soldiers with itchy
trigger fingers held their fire for 40 minutes . finally, when the
mobs, using young boys as shields, surged toward the radio station and
other key government buildings, the troops opened up at point-blank
range . the crowd fell back in confusion, regrouped, and raced down
main avenues . armed with clubs, rocks and torches, they demolished
stores, set fire to trees . teheran's ancient bazaar went up in flames
. the mob beat up every welldressed man unlucky enough to be on the
street, attacked unveiled women . one was yanked from her automobile by
the zealots, forced to undress, then was pummeled to death . closed
cemetery . nearly 7,000 troops were called out to restore uneasy peace
in teheran ; by then damage was estimated in the millions, at least
1,000 were injured, and the officially reported death toll was 86 . it
was undoubtedly higher, but since the public cemetery was closed and
under heavy guard to prevent further clashes at the gravesides, the
real number remained unknown . for the first time in a decade, martial
law was imposed on the city, along with a dusk-to-dawn curfew . hoping
to preserve quiet for a while, premier assadollah alam also announced
that troops would remain on emergency duty . their orders : shoot to
kill . at week's end the shah emerged from safety, promptly resumed
handing out property deeds to landless peasants . " we will not retreat
one millimeter, " he told 12,000 new landowners in a ceremony at
hamadan, 175 miles west of teheran . the riots, he said, were "
shameful for a civilized society and a crime against humanity . "
mullahs, however, remained defiant . handwritten notices blossomed on
walls in qum promising that any moslem who cut off the ears or nose of
a policeman would go to heaven ; the killing of a policeman would
bring allah's immediate forgiveness of sin .

south viet nam 2-12 the religious crisis a dusk-to-dawn curfew emptied
the streets of the ancient vietnamese capital of hue, 400 miles north
of saigon . riot police and armored personnel carriers patrolled the
dark and deserted city . roadblocks were set up on the outskirts, and
barbed-wire barricades encircled the sacred tudam pagoda . these
government security measures were not a precaution against an attack by
communist guerrillas ; they were taken to quell demonstrations by
hue's buddhist population against the regime of roman catholic
president ngo dinh diem . while all the world's attention was focused
on south viet nam's bitter struggle against the reds, the country was
divided by a religious conflict that might imperil the entire course of
the war against the viet cong . morality crusade . south viet nam's
buddhists, who comprise 80 per cent of the country's 15 million
people, are bitter over alleged favoritism by diem and his catholic
ruling family toward the nation's 1,500,000 catholics . the buddhists
have long complained that the government gives catholics the best civil
service jobs and that diem, because he feels that catholics are more
solidly anticommunist, promotes them to higher positions in the army .
many young vietnamese army officers, claim buddhist leaders, have
become converts to catholicism to win official favor . " but if the
viet cong ever come through the barbed wire, " said one u.s . officer
of his recently converted vietnamese counterpart, " i have a feeling
he'll do his praying to buddha . " buddhists feel that diem's
government is trying to make catholicism the official state religion,
point to the morality crusade of diem's militantly catholic
sister-in-law, mme . ngo dinh nhu . in sharp variance with the easy
social mores of most south vietnamese, mme . nhu has banned abortion,
adultery, polygamy, concubinage, divorce (except by presidential
dispensation), and the sale of contraceptives . diem indiganntly
replied that buddhist leaders are " damned fools " to think that he is
trying to suppress their religion . " i don't forget, " he says, " that
80 per cent of the votes that elected me president were buddhist votes
. " catholics maintain that they occupy so many influential posts only
because their church schools turn out far better educated graduates
than buddhist schools . in a sharply worded statement, mme . nhu
challenged the good faith of striking bonzes (monks) . " the robe does
not make the bonze, " said mme . nhu . " it is necessary to examine
very closely the comportment of certain so-called buddhist monks who
continue to make not only inconsiderate but false remarks and overtly
assume an attitude incompatible with their presumed state of holy men .
/ protest strike . the situation came to a head last month in hue (pop
. 106,000), which happens to be the see of diem's brother, archbishop
ngo dinh thuc . though catholics were allowed to fly vatican flags at a
church celebration honoring archbishop thuc, three days later the
government forbade the buddhists to unfurl their religious flags for
the 2,507th birthday of gautama buddha . when the buddhists staged a
protest march against the edict, government armored cars fired over the
heads of the rioters . in the melee, nine people were killed . the
buddhists blamed the slaughter on diem's troops ; the government
blamed the killings on communist agitators . the hue disaster caused
buddhist demonstrations throughout the country . buddhist delegations
in saigon demanded the removal of restrictions on their faith, equal
job opportunities and indemnity for the families of the dead and
wounded in hue . instead, the government arrested demonstrators, blamed
the unrest on " liars, foreigners and the viet cong . " when another
buddhist crowd gathered in hue last week, troops dispersed it with
crude tear-gas bombs that sent 67 people to the hospital with chemical
burns . u.s . officials in saigon fear that the mounting religious
strife can only benefit the viet cong by dividing the people and the
predominantly buddhist army just as the government forces are beginning
to gain a military advantage over the reds . diem made some
conciliatory gestures ; but with the situation fast deteriorating,
they might prove not to be enough he ordered the removal of the
barricades in
hue and in a nationwide radio broadcast admitted that some of his aides
had not shown " sufficient understanding and sensitivity " in dealing
with the crisis .

africa third largest although africa is full of talk about
mergers and federations of new nations, often the unity schemes are no
more firm than maps drawn in the sand . but in kenya last week, a
serious, sensible and long-considered plan took shape . in nairobi,
newly elected prime minister jomo kenyatta presided over a meeting of
his neighbors . on one side sat uganda's prime minister milton apollo
obote, grinning cheerfully beneath his toothbrush mustache ; on the
other, tanganyika's high-spririted president julius nyerere . present
as an observer : somalia's foreign minister abdullahi issa . from
three hours of talk emerged the decision to work for a federation of
kenya, uganda, tanganyika and zanzibar, with somalia, rwanda and
burundi also invited . " we have a common history, culture and customs
which make our unity both logical and natural, " declared kenyatta,
thereby seeming to refute old charges that he was parochially
interested only in pushing the fortunes of his kikuyu tribe, the most
numerous in kenya . " we reject tribalism, racialism or inward-looking
policies . " the east african federation, which may be launched when
kenya gains full independence, probably later this year, could
eventually become a nation of 25 million people, the third largest in
africa . there is no clear notion yet as to who will run the federation
or how tight it will be, but a joint committee will spend the next two
months drafting a program for joint economic planning, the
establishment of common defense, foreign and diplomatic representation,
and a central bank . federation, said the three leaders, will create "
a formidable force and a vast market . " among many critical problems
facing the proposed federation are kenya's occasionally bloody dispute
with somalia, probable opposition from buganda's frederick mutesa ii (
/ king freddie " ), and resistance from kenya's 55,000 remaining
european settlers, who may be apprehensive of submersion in even more
millions of africans . but the federation scheme was off to a
remarkably resolute start . when a newsman in nairobi complimented
president nyerere on how quickly the plan had been launched, nyerere
smiled broadly . " what do you mean, quick ? " said he . " this is
something we've been thinking about for 40 years . /

first thought ginsberg either a " spy or madman " but after a poetry
reading one monk told him : " you are an enlightened one . maybe all
the people in the world are asleep except you . you are awake . "
awakened, ginsberg almost immediately left south viet nam, commenting,
/ this place depresses me . " guinea's president sekou toure, on the
way home from the pan-african summit conference in addis ababa, stopped
off in tanganyika . arriving 20 minutes early for a private dinner at
arusha's plush safari hotel at the foot of cloud-capped mount meru,
toure seemed miffed because 1) european and african guests relaxing in
the lobby did not " stand as a mark of respect to him, " 2) the hotel
was not decorated by either flowers or the national flag of tanganyika
and guinea . after the toure party stalked out, the tanganyikan
government closed down the hotel, evicting its 28 guests . explained an
african official : " we are very sensitive to no appreciation of our
dignity . " moise tshombe, president of katanga, hastily left his
capital of elisabethville when central government authorities picked up
several valises full of his personal papers, which had been cached in

france warrior's rest for all his preoccupation with building the new
france, le grand charles is also his country's grand liseur, whose
voracious reading at least two hours of each day . on rising,
de gaulle skims through the morning press, after lunch he peruses le
monde, then he snatches a few chapters from a book . evenings, de
gaulle relaxes in a bedroom chair with more books . inundated by gift
copies, de gaulle leafs through every volume sent him, reads with care
those that seem promising . afterward he writes personal notes in
longhand to the author, length and warmth depending on his opinion of
the work (one of his highest compliments : " i congratulate myself for
having read your book " ) . in recent months de gaulle has polished
off, among others, francois d'harcourt's l'asie, reveil d'un monde,
dealing with the diversity of asian cultures ; edouard sablier's de
l'oural a l'atlantique, a dissertation on communist penetration ;
l'histoire secrete, a history of france from 1936 through the algerian
war ; and lagrandissement, an abstract novel by claude mauriac . for
light reading, de gaulle occasionally shows a penchant for the torrid .
the pro-gaullist weekly le nouveau candide raised parisian eyebrows
some time ago by reporting that de gaulle had read les pianos
mecaniques by henri-francois rey . a french bestseller highly praised
by the critics, pianos is a sort of dolce vita set on spain's costa
brava whose main characters a schizophrenic journalist, a neglected
teen-age boy and girl, a half-wit charwoman move through their
pointless lives battling boredom with promiscuity . sample passage : "
she led him to the bed, still keeping their lips locked . vincent lay
down . jenny detached herself . she began to undress him, with sure
clean motions . . . " it is just possible that the president did not
know what he was getting into when he started the book . once during a
lunch with friends, he asked one of the wives present : " what have
you been reading ? " answer : le repos de guerrier (the warrior's
rest) . apparently thinking it a military tome, the president said
eagerly : " ah, tres bien . could you lend it to me ? " actually,
the book, whose movie version starred brigitte bardot, was a sultry
item dealing more with conquests in the bedroom than on the battlefield

great britain the time of the trollop " a great
party, " cried viscount hailsham on tv last week, " is not to be
brought down by a woman of easy virtue ! " but the possibility was
real enough . in the huse of commons this week, prime minister harold
macmillan would have to confront criticism from the laborites, plus
some barely suppressed dissent in his own party, of the way in which he
handled, or mishandled, the profumo scandal . in the long run, the
tories faced an even more elusive and insidious threat than
parliamentary attacks the facts in police dossiers and in the private
lives of people who personify conservative rule . a lie in the nude .
the week leading up to the debate in the commons consisted mostly of
talk but what talk . christine keeler, the cause of it all, was
strangely irrepressible and outwardly serene amid the tumbling of
facades and the crash of reputations . blossoming forth in ever more
dazzling photographs she became britain's fastest-rising fallen woman .
she was besieged by film and nightclub offers and incorporated herself
as christine keeler, ltd . she even landed, uncaptioned, on the cover
of the austere economist . as for her mentor, osteopath stephen ward,
he was in jail, bound for trial on charges of living on prostitutes'
earnings . the evidence, it was widely suspected, would prove damaging
to a great many people . although the labor party concentrated on the
security question, in public debate the profumo case inevitably turned
into a moral issue . significantly, the unpardonable crime of
ex-secretary of state for war john profumo was not that he was
indiscreet and a potential security risk, but that he lied to the house
of commons in initially denying any relationship with christine .
moreover, he lied stupidly, since he might have saved his dignity and
his seat as an m.p . by admitting his misstep . as a limerick that made
the rounds of westminster last week had it : " what on earth have you
done .? " said christine, " you have wrecked the whole party machine
. " to lie in the nude " is not at all rude, " but to lie in the house
is obscene . /
serialized sex . the labor party rallied for
battle with enthusiasm . returning from a week's visit to moscow and
pleasant if futile chats with khrushchev about disarmament, labor party
leader harold wilson hinted he would produce new evidence this week to
show that britain's security system was breached . he had good reason
for confidence : the daily mail's national opinion poll gave labor its
biggest lead ever : 69.2 per cent to 19.8 per cent over the tories .
on his return from a golfing vacation, macmillan's first objective was
to command a united cabinet . calling his ministers into emergency
session, he asked each man to outline privately his own view of the
situation . without exception, the 21 top tories expressed deep dismay
at the public's loss of confidence in the government . macmillan was
caught between two almost equally unpleasant possibilities . had he
known about profumo's doings, and in that case had he not connived to
some extent in his false denials ? or, despite the war minister's
long reputation as a womanizer, had macmillan really not known anything
? in that case, had he not been naive and negligent when he accepted
profumo's defense ? bed & bawd . in his own defense, macmillan
maintains that he was first informed of profumo's liaison last february
. he denies reports that mi-5 british intelligence had warned the
government at that time that its war minister had shared bed and bawd
with soviet assistant naval attache evgeny ivanov . macmillan insisted
that he had no reason to doubt a man of profumo's background (harrow,
oxford, infantry) . moreover, five of his ministers who " sat up half
the night " of march 21 interrogating profumo were also persuaded that
he was telling the truth ; the clincher was the war minister's
readiness to deny misconduct with christine keeler in a sacrosanct "
personal statement " on the house floor next day . macmillan's
strongest argument was that a security check, which he ordered a week
before his former colleague's confession, had turned up no evidence
that the russian had succeeded in using the profumo-keeler-ivanov
triangle to pry out secret information . something of a cabinet mutiny
seemed to be led by health minister enoch powell, 51, whose distaste
for political compromise led him to resign from the government in 1958
in protest against an inflationary, vote-catching budget . powell's
feeling that the government had once more shown itself unbelievably lax
was shared to a lesser degree by two more of macmillan's ablest
appointees, education minister sir edward boyle (who quit the
government over suez) and housing minister sir keith joseph, as well as
a disgruntled minority of tory backbenchers, who could themselves
overthrow the government if 20 or 30 chose to abstain this week . but
macmillan's assurances quelled the mutiny, and the tories marched into
commons outwardly united to face their greatest political threat since
suez .
an
attempt to find out the date on which the u.s . was supposed to " give
the h-bomb to west germany, " sounded more like a propaganda ploy than
serious espionage . flash of indignation . the opposition may yet
succeed in showing that britain's security system was in fact breached,
or that warnings from intelligence fell on deaf ears . whatever the
outcome of this week's commons debate, there is a growing belief that
macmillan will have to step down eventually and may in fact have
promised his own dissident ministers to do so once the heat is off .
loose factions were already forming around such possible successors to
macmillan as deputy prime minister r . a . ( " rab " ) butler,
chancellor of the exchequer reginald maudling and science minister lord
hailsham . no matter how eloquently macmillan may weather the
parliamentary crisis, the tories simply cannot afford to be tarred by
christine . what they have traditionally offered the nation is men born
and raised in the exacting disciplines of leadership . if now, in
addition to all the political and economic reverses they have suffered
in the past year, britons should conclude that etonian and harrovian
leaders are personally no wiser or more upright and in many cases they
have proved flagrantly less so than those whom they govern, twelve
years of tory government may end in a mighty flash of moral indignation
mixed with ridicule .

there'll always be an . . . the morals of the british have always
intrigued and baffled foreigners . for centuries, europeans visiting
that cold, controlled country have discovered to their amazement and
frequent envy that the abundance, subtlety and variety of sexual sport
in london's demimonde make continental capitals seem parochial . until
recent years, it was impossible to go to dinner at london's most
fashionable clubs or private houses without passing swarms of
well-turned-out and sometimes handsome streetwalkers standing guard on
the sidewalk . like many another foreign analyst of anglo-saxon
attitudes, french diarist hippolyte taine, visiting london in the mid
19th century, could not comprehend how the english could sustain the "
vehemence and pungency of their passions " against " the harsh, though
silent, grinding of their moral machinery . " there is a widespread
feeling that britain's moral machinery is not grinding as harshly as it
used to . much in english life today suggests decadence and dissolution
. since the girls were driven off the streets four years ago, they have
taken to advertising their services in shop windows as " masseuses, " /
models, " or " french teachers . " london's booming striptease parlors
offer some of the crudest live pornography to be  seen publicly in
europe . its parks in summer are pre-empted by couples who aren't just
necking . one third of all teen-age brides in britain are already
pregnant . innumerable scandals preceding the profumo case suggest
considerable promiscuity, along with sexual arrangements infinitely
more complex than the old-fashioned triangle . and, as everyone knows,
homosexuality is " the english vice . " psychologist g . m . carstairs
commented recently : " popular morality is now a wasteland, littered
with the debris of broken conventions . concepts such as honor, or even
honesty, have an old-fashioned sound, but nothing has taken their place
. " getting caught . this harsh judgment may overlook the fact that
britain was never the sort of place victorian morality pretended it was
. if london today resembles babylon-on-thames, it is little more than a
de luxe model of the brutal, carnal 18th century city whose brothels,
boudoirs and gin shops ( " drunk for a penny, dead drunk for tuppence "
) were pictured by hogarth, richardson and fielding . says malcolm
muggeridge : " there's always been a lot of high-grade whoring in this
country, " and there is a lot of past evidence to prove him right .
george iv had his queen tried publicly for infidelity ; in the early
18th century, an archbishop of york maintained a harem at his palace .
the 18th century christine keeler was a miss chudleigh, who had been
the mistress of three peers when george ii spotted her at a costume
ball, cunningly disguised in a transparent gown . her georgian era came
between two noble marriages (one bigamous) . in the 18th century
phrase, borrowed from nautical terminology, miss chudleigh had "
bottom, " or what it takes .
indeed, the british
reserve a special order of venery for distinguished doxies such as emma
hamilton, the onetime streetwalker who for years was civilly shared by
her ambassador husband, sir william, and admiral lord nelson, the
father of her daughter . one of the most successful of all high-society
hustlers was harriette wilson, a regency beauty whose guest register
would have read like burke's peerage ; when she started publishing her
memoirs, she managed to collect double dividends from many former
patrons who preferred not to be immortalized . but not the iron duke of
wellington, who, when told by harriette that she planned to chronicle
his indiscretions, roared : " publish and be damned ! " she did .
since the mid-19th century, sin for a politician has meant getting
caught at it . at least three officially virtuous prime ministers, lord
palmerston, arthur balfour and lloyd george, were inveterate adulterers
. thus the state of sexual morality in britain today is probably no
worse than it ever was, and there is much evidence that it is better .
britain may not be a moral wasteland but a battleground in which a more
realistic, less hypocritical generation is attempting to win legal and
social recognition of the facts of everyday life . sparing the horses .
with the loss of empire and the decline of the church as an influence
in society, britons have tempered their old moral certitudes . author
james morris fears that his compatriots are becoming " congenitally
incapable of disregarding the opposite point of view, are constantly
grouping toward some general synthesis of everybody's point of view on
everything . " but the stir created by the profumo case suggests that
there is still a lot of power left in the " moral machinery . " what
has really changed in britain are matters of style and outlook, of
class and economic structure . fornication has always seemed more
spectacular in the upper and lower reaches of society . but now, says d
. w . brogan, " it may well be that the middle classes are taking up
the vices of their betters and also of their inferiors . " if there is
no longer real poverty in britain, the affluent society has been even
kinder to the new-rich . it is at this level that life in britain often
seems tasteless, aimless and immoral . a new twist to a victorian music
hall ballad " it's the rich wot gets the pleashoor, it's the poor wot
gets the blyme " was added recently by minister of housing sir keith
joseph, who said earnestly : " it is harder for the rich or the
relatively secure to be pure . " and yet too much can be blamed on
economic factors, leading to what the economist calls " the untenable
implication that adultery would have been less rampant if only the
country had been decent enough to stay poor . " decency is often a
question of style . many britons feel that there was nothing wrong, or
at least new, in a cabinet minister having a mistress . but there is a
slightly snobbish feeling that christine keeler and her set really were
a bit too casual . although in britain the official mistress has never
quite reached the glittering status she has in france, the great and
small affairs of the past were more likely to be quiet, settled,
near-permanent arrangements . a new factor, says daily mail columnist
anne scott-james, is the " sleaziness of the crowd with which the war
minister mixed . " says muggeridge : " fifty years ago people would
have gone to maida vale and patronized one of the grandes cocottes . if
there is anything new in this, it is the overlapping of the social life
of cliveden and of ward . " in short, britain may be in danger of
abandoning actress mrs . pat campbell's celebrated axiom about

russia romanoff & juliet it was by all odds the most extraordinary
date a man and woman ever had . the soviets one day last week
orbited vostok v, piloted by air force lieut . colonel valery
feodorovich bykovsky, 28 . listen world, headlined izvestia, soviet man
is again storming the cosmos . but this time, soviet woman was
storming right along . two days later, bykovsky was joined in orbit by
the first female in space, lieut . valentina vladimirovna chereshkova,
26, at the controls of vostok vi . in radio and television
transmission to the breathless spectators on the ground, he referred
to himself as " the hawk, " while she called herself " the seagull . /
weightless . soon after bykovsky was launched, khrushchev gave a hint
of what was to come . when britain's visiting harold wilson asked how
many cosmonauts were up, he replied delightedly : " only one--so
far . /
as bykovsky soared through his orbit, at a speed of 18,000 m.p.h. and
in an oval that ranged from 109 miles to 139 miles above the earth,
he dined on roast beef and chicken, manually operated the controls of
his spacecraft . from the capsule, live television images were
periodically flashed to soviet viewers . bykovsky waved his logbook,
let his pencil and other objects float in the cabin to demonstrate
weightlessness . on his fourth orbit, the cosmonaut talked directly to
khrushchev in the kremlin . not yet a full-fledged party member,
bykovsky said : " i want to be a communist, a member of our great
leninist party . " after seagull joined hawk, there were more messages .
said khrushchev : " dear valentina vladimirovna, cordial
congratulations to the world's first woman cosmonaut on the wonderful
flight through the expanses of the universe :. a happy journey to you
 ! we will be extremely glad to meet you on soviet soil . /
smiling at the tv camera in her capsule--some viewers described her as
resembling a tougher-looking ingrid bergman--valentina thanked
khrushchev for his " fatherly concern, " assured everyone that she
was feeling fine . together . her biography made her sound like a
perfect specimen of socialist womanhood : father a tractor driver
killed in world war ii, mother a factory worker . cosmonette
valentina herself was a textile worker, night school student and
young communist functionary until she got interested in parachuting as
a hobby (she made 126 jumps) and was picked for cosmonaut training .
the russians , of course, had earlier managed a tandem space shot, with
two men . this time, though, the expectation was that they would try
to " dock " the two capsules together aloft,
thus possibly permitting one of the pair of cosmonauts to transfer
into the spacecraft of the other . even if this extra twist does not
come off, the duo flight once again proves that russia is at least two
years ahead of the u.s. in space, and moreover, knows how to woo
the world's females . stated purpose of the valery-valentina feat :
to study the impact of space " on the organism of a man and a woman . /

greece the king wants to travel the king was working in the
garden . he seemed very glad to see me . we walked through the garden .
this is the queen, he said . she was clipping a rose bush . oh how do
you do, she said . we sat down at a table under a big tree and the king
ordered whiskey and soda . we have good whiskey anyway, he said . . . it
was very jolly . we talked for a long time . like all greeks he wanted
to go to america . thus, in just about the shortest story he ever
wrote, ernest hemingway 40 years ago described king constantine and
queen sophia as they were clinging to the unstable throne of greece .
last week constantine's son, king paul, was also in his gardened palace
at tatoi, outside athens, and the whiskey was still good . but unlike
his father, paul did not want to go to america . he wanted to go to
britain, and his premier would not let him, thereby precipitating a
first-class political crisis . private refuge . the petty-seeming issue
of the trip is actually part of a wider, more complex problem . premier
constantine karamanlis, 56, is a tough, staunchly anti-communist,
pro-nato politician who in his eight years in office (the longest
tenure for any greek prime minister) has given his country stable
government and a considerable measure of economic progress . but
leftists and liberals attack him for allegedly having rigged the 1961
elections, which returned him to power for a fourth term, and for
keeping about 1,000 political prisoners jailed who were arrested more
than 15 years ago during the country's bitter and victorious war with
red insurgents . communists and well-meaning liberals outside greece,
particularly in britain, this year started a concerted campaign against
the karamanlis regime, and against the royal family notably queen
frederika, who was accused of nazi connections . bertrand russell's
ban-the-bombers joined the fray, and last april, when frederika was in
london for the wedding of her third cousin princess alexandra, she was
set upon by a crowd of demonstrators and forced to seek refuge in a
private house . britain's anti-greek chorus was swelled by lord
beaverbrook, who, for reasons of his own, scurrilously attacked her in
his newspapers for her german background . with all this in mind,
karamanlis advised the king belatedly against a planned state visit to
britain in july . there might be similar incidents during the trip, he
said, and the greek rightists, resenting left-wing attacks abroad,
might make trouble, too, as they did in salonika recently, where a
left-wing member of the greek parliament was killed . the king's
plaintive rejoinder was that he had accepted the invitation long ago
and it would be ungentlemanly to back out now . the british had
promised adequate security . besides, he did not want to appear to give
in to pressure from the left . king paul was reinforced by pert queen
frederika who, like her great-great-grandmother queen victoria,
strongly feels that she knows better than her ministers what is good
for her country . embarrassing reds . rebuffed, karamanlis handed in
his resignation . usually known as loyal to the king, he was
nevertheless trying to put the royal family in its place, because of
widespread feeling in greece that they have taken a somewhat-too-active
part in politics of late . at the same time, karamanlis was trying to
bring about new elections, confident that his national radical union,
which holds 180 of 300 seats in parliament, would be victorious .
instead of calling elections, however, king paul at week's end was
attempting to patch up a coalition of present parties in parliament the
20 communist members, out of dislike of karamanlis, are embarrassingly
behind the king . but the attempt is doomed to failure unless some of
karamanlis' deputies join the coalition . karamanlis seemed undisturbed
by the royal maneuvering . " they are trying to break up my party, " he
said scornfully . snapping one finger across his palm, he added : /
but i have got my party like that . " meanwhile, without a government,
the king and queen quite literally did not know whether to stay in
their garden at tatoi or start packing for their trip . under the greek
constitution, the monarch cannot leave the country without the consent
of his government .

italy victory, of sorts, in sicily " attila is at the gates, /
thundered ernesto cardinal ruffini, archbishop of palermo . well, not
exactly . sicily was holding regional elections, and the communists
threatened to repeat the massive gains they had scored in italy's
national elections seven weeks ago . red boss palmiro togliatti himself
was on hand to campaign . back and forth across the island scurried
hundreds of communist squadristi (shock troops), trying to swing
undecided voters . premier-designate aldo moro's christian democrats,
having learned painfully from the april results that it does not pay to
peddle anti-communism softly, waged a tough campaign against "
khrushchev's false smiles . " they could also point to sicily's
significant economic progress under their administration . the
christian democrats' campaign succeeded . the reds, while keeping their
place as the second largest party in sicily (and the nation), picked up
only one new seat in the 90-member regional assembly, for a total of 22
. their share of the ballots inched up to 24.8 per cent , 1 per cent
higher than their local share in april . the free-enterprising liberals
matched their earlier success, more than doubled their representation
(from two seats to five) . the christian democrats gained three
assembly seats for a new total of 37, won almost 980,000 of the
2,300,000 ballots cast, emerged with 42 per cent of the vote, a rise of
more than 3 per cent since april and more than they had ever polled in
sicily . wrote one christian democratic paper jubilantly : " we have
broken the 40 per cent barrier . " his position somewhat strengthened
by the sicily results, moro will now try to put together a new
coalition cabinet based on the alliance between the christian democrats
and the nenni socialists . but even if he can thus continue the "
opening to left, " moro's and italy's troubles will only be beginning .

west germany alt lang syne by bus, automobile and special trains,
250,000 germans originally from silesia poured into cologne last week .
jamming open-air restaurants and bierstuben, they swapped stories with
old friends over rhenish beer and schnapps beneath banners proclaiming
/ for silesia . " the occasion was the regular reunion of germans
expelled from communist poland after world war ii . during a mammoth
rally at fairgrounds on the banks of the rhine, the gemutlich scene
suddenly turned into a riot ; stirred up by a rabble-rousing
politician, the crowd nearly mobbed a german tv reporter who had
suggested that poland is doing well by the territories seized from
germany after world war ii . in german politics, it is an article of
faith that these territories must one day be liberated and that the
germans driven from the area will be able to go home . but this belief,
while steadfastly maintained in public, is becoming increasingly hollow
. far more realistic than last week's mob scene was a rare joint
appearance by christian democrat chancellor konrad adenauer and
berlin's socialist mayor willy brandt, both of whom pleaded for
reconciliation with poland . the emotions that can still be stirred up
by talk about the " lost homelands " in the east sometimes obscure a
major political and social development in west germany : the
remarkably successful integration into the nation's life of 13 million
refugees, onequarter of the population . happy miracle . when their
trek to freedom began 18 years ago, few thought that quick resettlement
was possible . in one of the worst forced migrations of modern times,
9,400,000 ethnic germans were abruptly expelled from communist europe,
showed up in west germany in tattered covered wagons and with empty
rucksacks . after the iron curtain snapped shut, 3,600,000 more germans
made their way west and heightened the crisis . the new arrivals were
penniless, homeless and embittered . in the immediate postwar days,
west germans themselves were not much better off . the fierce
competition between natives and " aliens " for jobs or even a roof
created an explosive climate of mutual recrimination . it seemed as if
the shaky new democracy, digging out of the wreckage of hitler's reich,
could scarcely survive the human avalanche . germany's " economic
miracle " drastically changed the picture . as the pace of recovery
quickened, thousands of the largely agricultural immigrants were
retrained for industrial jobs, and became indispensable to the
labor-short german economy . sharing the credit for the tougher
political miracle of resettlement are the federal republic's two major
political parties . competing actively for the " refugee vote, "
christian democrats and socialists backed a unique 50 per cent tax on
all property that west germans had managed to save through the war, in
order to compensate refugees who had lost their possessions . a special
equalization of burdens bank granted thousands of lowcredit business
loans . since virtually all were homeless, the east germans were the
chief beneficiaries of 6,500,000 new housing units built since the war
. revealing sign . inevitably, there have been disappointments . about
10 per cent of the refugees still live in substandard housing,
including 700 silesian and sudeten germans whose flowerpots and
television antennas eerily sprout from the reconverted barracks at
dachau . many still feel that they are worse off now than they were in
their old homes . only one out of six farmers tills his own land ;
when he does, it is on a much smaller plot than he owned in the east .
but most refugees have good jobs, and some who arrived penniless now
own thriving businesses . thousands have married west germans and
raised families . major indicator that the onetime aliens now consider
themselves real west germans is the collapse of the refugee party,
which once had 27 seats in the bundestag . it has had no national voice
since 1957 ; last month in lower saxony, where refugees comprise about
25 per cent of the population, it polled a scant 3.7 per cent of the
vote during state elections . says hans koplitz, a sudeten german who
now owns a prosperous laundry and dry-cleaning establishment in munich
: " most, we pay lip service to the idea of returning to our
homelands . /

new york : by a 10-0 vote, with the soviet union abstaining, the
security council last week approved secretary-general u thant's plan to
send a u.n . truce team to strife-torn yemen . heading the advance
guard, von horn took off for yemen's capital city of san " a with the
objective of 1) ending saudi arabian aid to the royalist rebels, 2)
creating a 25-mile demilitarized strip along the saudi-yemeni frontier,
and 3) supervising the phased withdrawal of 28,000 egyptian troops who
have spent the last eight months bloodily propping up the republican
regime of president abdullah sallal against the royalist mountain
tribes fighting to restore deposed imam mohamed el badr to his
1,000-year-old throne . bombs at night . a peacemaking veteran with
years of experience in the gaza strip and the congo, von horn is not
sanguine about his chances in yemen . on a brief visit in april, he
discovered that royalist tribesmen had ambushed some 40 egyptian
soldiers, killed them all and stuffed their severed heads inside their
slashed-open bellies . at the time, von horn gloomily concluded that
the war could go on ten years . in new york, u thant blandly expects it
all to be over in " two to four months . " holed up in the impregnable
mountains of central yemen, the royalists make hit-and-run raids in all
directions, have sometimes infiltrated as close as the military airport
outside san " a . the egyptians have been on the defensive since
february and make only local counterattacks to regain objectives such
as
water sources, seized by the royalists . the offensive is left to
egypt's russian-built fighter and bomber planes, which plaster royalist
villages with high explosive and napalm . there were reports last week
that the egyptians are now using gas warfare to pry the rebels out of
their mountain caves . in the week before von horn's arrival, the
desperate egyptians made air strikes against saudi arabia . a dawn raid
on the seaport of jizan killed 25 and wounded 300 sleeping inhabitants
. the egyptian excuse : renewed royalist activity must mean renewed
military aid from saudi arabia . nonexistent ally . while his nation
suffered, yemen's president sallal was on a triumphal tour of the
middle east . though plagued by conspiracies at home he crushed two "
imperialist " plots in his own regime before leaving sallal got
tremendous ovations from street crowds in damascus and baghdad . in
lordly style, he urged the baathist leaders of syria and iraq to
disperse the " summer cloud " of their differences with egypt's nasser,
and grandly offered the virtually nonexistent yemen republican army as
an ally in repulsing " zionist and imperialist aggressors . " at his
mountain headquarters in yemen, the royalist leader imam badr told
newsmen he intends to keep fighting against the " egyptian colonization
of yemen, " and boasted that if the egyptians ever did leave, " we
would occupy the entire country within a week . " as for the united
nations, badr said, " i am not interested in the u.n., which i once
thought stood for justice . only the people of yemen will achieve a
solution . we put our trust in god and in our people . /

south viet nam trial by fire the automobile at the head of the
procession of saffron-robed buddhist monks in saigon suddenly choked to
a stop at an intersection . the occupants of the car lifted its hood as
chanting priests began forming a circle seven or eight deep around the
vehicle . prayer beads clutched in his hand, a phlegmatic, 73-year-old
monk named thich quang duc sat down cross-legged on the asphalt in the
center of the circle . from under the auto's hood, a monk took a
canister of gasoline and poured it over the old priest . an expression
of serenity on his wizened face, quang duc suddenly struck a match . as
flames engulfed his body, he made not a single cry nor moved a muscle .
/ oh my god, " cried a western observer, " oh my god . " casting the
blame . in the buddhist faith, self-sacrifice is often undertaken to
transfer the suffering of others to one's self . the martyr is usually
considered a holy man so close to nirvana that he is unaffected by pain
. quang duc's premeditated act was a demonstration of buddhist
determination to force south viet nam's roman catholic president ngo
dinh diem to knuckle under to demands for increased religious freedom
(time, june 14) . in a will written " before closing my eyes to buddha,
/ quang duc wrote : " i have the honor of presenting my words to
president diem, asking him to be kind and tolerant toward his people
and to enforce a policy of religious equality . " diem's reply was to
clamp virtual martial law over saigon . all the city's main pagodas
were sealed off, and barbed-wire barricades blocked off streets . on
the radio, diem blamed quang duc's " tragic death " on " certain minds,
poisoned by seditious propaganda . " refusing to yield to buddhist
demands, diem added : " buddhism in viet nam finds its fundamental
safeguards in the constitution, of which i personally am the guardian .
/ the warning . but diem's intransigence troubled the u.s . in saigon,
u.s . embassy officials bluntly warned diem that the u.s . would
publicly condem his treatment of the buddhists unless he took prompt
action to redress their grievances . behind the u.s . threat was the
fear that continued buddhist discontent could cause passive resistance
to government programs in the rural provinces where political unity is
the key to victory in the war against the communist viet cong . the u.s
. warning seemed to sink in . at meetings with buddhist leaders,
government officials tentatively acceded to all their demands the
government
promised to change existing laws so as to give buddhism equal standing
with catholicism, granted buddhists the right to fly their flags at
religious festivals . it was the flag restriction at hue last month
that set off demonstrations in which nine buddhist marchers were gunned
down by government troops . under prodding from buddhist leaders, the
government, which had blamed the viet cong for the hue tragedy,
reluctantly agreed to take the blame for the incident . but if the
government should renege on its agreement, the buddhists have
threatened two more ritualistic suicides one by fire and one by
disembowelment .

southeast asia triplets reunited indonesia, malaya and the
philippines are " triplets " who became separated at birth, who were
placed under the care of different foster parents but who have now come
of age and are trying to rediscover their common origin and shape their
common destiny . " this description of the three malay states was
offered last year by philippine president diosdado macapagal . in
manila last week, the top ministers of the three nations made plans to
bring the triplets together again . the event suggested that, at least
for the time being, cantankerous indonesia is getting to be a more
responsible citizen in the southeast asia neighborhood . the new
grouping would loosely join indonesia and the philippines to tunku
abdul rahman's federation of malaysia (malaya, singapore, north borneo,
sarawak and brunei) to be established aug . 31 . the philippines claim
a part of north borneo as its own but agreed amicably to postpone
settlement of the issue . indonesia's president sukarno, who had
condemned the malaysia federation as an imperialist plot, apparently
realized that since he can't stop it, he might as well try to join it .
most surprising item in the manila agreement was a pledge of mutual
defense against " subversion in any form or manifestation . " this
pledge is aimed not only at communism but also against the sizable
chinese minorities who dominate the industry and trade of southeast
asia . still, any anti-communist step is remarkable for indonesia .
having made this political move more favorable to the west, some
observers expect that sukarno will soon make a move to placate red
china . next step : a july summit conference at manila between
sukarno, abdul rahman and macapagal to set up a permanent consultative

africa albert schweitzer : an anachronism still they come, all
year round, to see the famed old man in his storied jungle setting .
public figures like adlai stevenson, starry-eyed u.s . peace corpsmen,
spinster schoolteachers realizing a longstanding dream all come for a
visit to dr . albert schweitzer . at his mission three miles upstream
from the gabonese village of lambarene, " the great white doctor, " now
88, affably greets them, autographing his books in a fine, steady hand
. yet, after devoting nearly two-thirds of his life ministering to the
sick of equatorial africa and being widely regarded as a near saint,
schweitzer is an anachronism in today's africa . after a journey to
lambarene, time correspondent jon randal reported why : once, to see
schweitzer, travelers had to be paddled the 175 miles from portgentil
on the atlantic . now they arrive by air from the gabonese capital of
libreville and put down at lambarene's modern airport, not far from a
modern, antiseptic government hospital . on the short trip up the
ogooue river, the visitors pass natives skimming by in brand-new boats
powered by evinrude outboards . finally they reach schweitzer's
hospital . set ghostlike amid wild palms and tangled jungle
undergrowth, its tin roofs and ramshackle wooden buildings are worthy
of rain or the heart of darkness . changeless isolation . in the
halfcentury since schweitzer came to lambarene with his wife helene and
performed his first operation in a converted hen house, the mission has
expanded but otherwise changed little . at the river landing there are
only pirogues, crude dugout canoes, the one type of river ambulance
schweitzer will use . ( " brancardier ! brancardier ! " (stretcher
bearer) the oarsmen cry when they arrive with an emergency.) the
hospital compound is without telephone, running water or refrigeration,
has electricity only in the main building, which houses the tiny,
antiquated operating theater . sterilization is carried out in an
outdoor lean-to and the only toilet is an outhouse for the use of the
foreign staff . with a capacity for some 400 patients, schweitzer's
clinic is forever jammed . the sick, carrying paper tags with their
names, villages and tribes, wait for hours to see the doctors, are
bedded down on straw-mattress cots in dark, stench-ridden huts whose
earth floors are awash during the rainy season . outside, over open
fires, the patients' women relatives cook, while a horde of chickens,
dogs and goats (protected under schweitzer's " reverence for life "
mystique by which no living thing should be unnecessarily disturbed)
roam at will, adding freely to the surrounding filth . when a patient
dies and his body is unclaimed, it is wrapped in a fern-andpalm-leaf
shroud, laid in a wooden box, and buried in the bush . tailored for
primitives . despite such squalor, schweitzer's institution has a good
medical record, and the city's europeans generally choose it over the
new government hospital . few hospitals anywhere can offer such a
dedicated staff, or one that lives as austerely . each of the doctors
and nurses occupies a single room equipped with iron bed, enamel wash
basin and kerosene lamp ; meals usually consist of fried bananas and
other fruit . the old man stubbornly refuses to go modern . says he :
/ circumstances command that the hospital be primitive in keeping with
the primitive state of the people . " he believes that africans enjoy
discomfort, and that they are often afraid of a gleaming white modern
hospital, but not of one that reminds them of their villages a concept
less valid today than 20 years ago . his african critics take
schweitzer's insistence on primitiveness as an insult, or a needless
prolongation of " the white man's burden . " symbolically, they point
out, he and his staff still wear pith helmets . the concept that the
dark continent can make more progress through independence is, to
schweitzer, folly . told that the peace corps is building primary
schools all over gabon, and that the little country has 14 medical
students training in france, dr . schweitzer merely chuckles and says
of the blacks : " you cannot change their mentality . " among his six
doctors and 17 nurses, there is not one african, nor is he training any
. says an upper-class african in lambarene : " i'd rather die
unattended than be humiliated at dr . schweitzer's hospital . "
according to the sun . bushy white hair aflare, drooping mustache
aquiver, cotton strips wound around his arms to absorb the sweat, he is
a little deaf but alert as a lion . he is still planning additions to
the hospital and is working on volume iii of the philosophy of
civilization . a few weeks ago, he announced that he would make no more
rest visits to europe, which his disciples take to mean that schweitzer
wants to die at lambarene, where his wife was buried six years ago . in
the jungle, the doctor has built a private world for himself which he
refuses to alter . even his time is his own ; the hospital clocks do
not run on g.m.t., like all the rest of the country, but are set
according to the sun . as far back as world war i, schweitzer expressed
his dislike for the modern world outside : " in a thousand different
ways mankind has been persuaded to give up its natural relations with
reality and to seek its welfare in the magic formulas of some kind of
economic and social witchcraft . " schweitzer has made his own reality
; he lives in the africa of 1913, hardly knowing or caring that a
continent and a century have passed him by .

great britain the lost leader as the house of commons
clock ticked toward starting time for the great debate, there were only
two empty seats in the jammed, expectant chamber . the first was
filled, with four minutes to spare, by harold macmillan, who sat down
stiffly on the government's front bench, looking as chill and wan as
his effigy at madame tussaud's . two minutes later, a short, plump man
in a shabby grey suit bustled expressionlessly down the gangway, sank
into the opposition front bench facing macmillan, and fingered a
cardboard file . as the clock struck, labor party leader harold wilson
rose to his feet and for a second savored the tingling silence before
breaking it with his flat nasal yorkshire voice . " this is a debate, "
he began, " without precedence in the annals of the house . " the two
men were the products of two remarkable political careers and also of
two britains : macmillan, the skillful, courageous and often ruthless
patrician who had rescued his country from the debris of suez and led
it into an era of unprecedented prosperity ; harold wilson, the dry,
diligent and often devious son of a provincial chemist who had risen by
hard work and chance (including the death of the man he succeeded, hugh
gaitskell) to the top of the labor party . as he faced macmillan, who
had gone to oxford by family tradition, harold wilson, who had gone to
oxford on a scholarship, strove to embody a new, impatient,
class-defying england . the moral decay surrounding the profumo affair,
he tried hard to suggest, must be blamed on the tories . referring to
christine keeler's reported $14,000-a-week nightclub contract, wilson
declared : " there is something utterly nauseating about a system of
society which pays a harlot 25 times as much as it pays its prime
minister . " for the rest, harold wilson stuck to the security issue
and the government's handling of the profumo case, which he attacked as
either dishonest or incompetent, or both . let down . the once
unflappable macmillan fidgeted in his seat and kept dabbing at the
pouches beneath his eyes with a crumpled handkerchief . when he rose,
he openly played for the sympathy of his colleagues . " what has
happened, " he said, " has inflicted a deep, bitter and lasting wound
on me . " essentially his defense was that he had been grossly deceived
by profumo an " almost unbelievable " culprit and badly let down by his
subordinates, who failed to keep him informed . from the back benches
came a rude gibe of " nobody ever tells me nuffin ! " by the time
macmillan finished, the house was prepared to acquit him of personal
dishonesty and moral turpitude, but he had convicted himself of
negligence and naivete or perhaps simply of a fatal ability to avert
his eyes from what he did not wish to see . in the vote following the
debate, 27 conservatives voted against macmillan or abstained . on all
sides there were cries of " resign, resign, " and this is what
macmillan will almost certainly have to do the only remaining question
being when . the warning . the long debate served to fix government
responsibility, or the lack of it, and illustrated the odd nature of
the british security system, compounded of shrewdness, inefficiency,
and an often misguided sense of sportsmanship that goes to
extraordinary lengths in protecting members of the club . the case, as
it emerged from the debate, falls into four phases .
first, there was the christine-profumo affair
itself, which, according to profumo, lasted only a few months, from
july to december 1961, but by other evidence possibly lasted longer .
during those same months, christine also entertained russian assistant
naval attache evgeny ivanov, who had been pals for some time with her
mentor, dr . stephen ward . mi-5, british intelligence, apparently
discovered only half of what wilson scathingly called " this dingy
quadrilateral . " in august 1961, according to the commons debate,
cabinet secretary sir norman brook warned profumo that it would be
better for the secretary for war not to be too friendly with ward ; he
did not mention, and evidently did not know about, christine . nothing
of this was reported to macmillan . in the second phase, which covers
most of 1962, rumors of the affair kept reaching the newspapers, tory
and labor politicians, but apparently not the prime minister . during
the cuba blowup, ward was all over the place, suggesting to the prime
minister's office and to the foreign office that his friend ivanov be
used as an intermediary to help settle the crisis . but said macmillan,
a lot of people were then trying to get into the act " to weaken our
resolution . " a little later, wilson himself got a letter from ward,
boasting of his supposed help in settling the cuba matter, but filed it
away as coming from a crank . before ivanov was recalled to moscow in
january 1963, he aroused suspicion in other ways . a bridge player who
took a hand in some very high-level games, he lost steadily, as much as
$140 a night . " i do not believe the soviet embassy's petty cash would
stand such losses every night, " said one labor m.p . caustically, /
unless they got something for it . " the vigil . in the third and most
remarkable phase, macmillan finally became aware that there was such a
thing as a profumo case . in january 1963, as macmillan told commons
police learned from christine that ward had asked her to find out from
profumo when the u.s . was to deliver certain nuclear information and
warheads to west germany (she said that she refused to do it) .
macmillan was not told of this either . but while he was away in italy,
the general manager of the huge (circ . 6,500,000) news of the world
reported the profumo rumors to macmillan's principal private secretary
. confronted with the story, profumo denied everything to several
officials ; the relationship had been innocent, he said, and anyway
had ended long before . why didn't the prime minister question profumo
himself at any time ? macmillan's lame answer : he assumed that
profumo would speak more freely to others, and furthermore such an
interrogation would have made " social relations " between himself and
profumo highly embarrassing . and why didn't anyone attempt to
interrogate christine herself to check out profumo's denial ? to
this, macmillan had no answer at all . after christine failed to appear
as a witness last march in the trial of a jealous negro lover who had
tried to shoot her, questions were finally raised in parliament .
macmillan asked for action, admittedly hoping for a statement from
profumo that would quell further rumors in the press through fear of
libel . when the house adjourned after midnight, profumo was awakened,
and at 1 : 30 a.m . came to chief tory whip martin redmayne's commons
office with his solicitor . he was confronted by redmayne, tory
chairman iain macleod, minister without portfolio william deedes,
attorney general sir john hobson and solicitor general sir peter
rawlinson . two of profumo's interrogators had been at harrow with him
. where last week he
was expelled from the communist party, dismissed from the intelligence
service, and sent to a mental hospital .
the letter . under friendly questioning until
5 a.m., profumo denied misconduct with christine . he agreed to make a
sacrosanct " personal statement, " assuring the house that he had
committed " no impropriety whatsoever " with miss keeler . his fellow
ministers suggested that he admit at least to being " on friendly terms
with her, " although it " sounded so awful, " as profumo put it . " we
insisted that it must be included, " explained macleod fatuously last
week, " because it was part of the truth . " against himself and the
four other ministers, macleod added, " two possible charges can be
brought . first, that we were conspiring knaves, and secondly, that we
were gullible fools . " they were indeed gullible but obviously they
wanted to be . even the most cursory checking would have disclosed that
while christine may have had joie de vivre, she had little discretion .
profumo's interrogators knew by then about a letter he had written to
christine in 1961 beginning " darling . . . " profumo explained, as
macmillan put it, that in his circles " it was a term of no great
significance . i believe that this might be accepted . i do not live
among young people fairly widely . " but if it was acceptable to
macmillan, at 69 a little remote from reality, it should not have
fooled the others . " we were a bunch of ninnies, " admits one of the
five privately, and adds with extraordinary logic : " we recalled that
earlier case, in which " my dear vassall' proved to be harmless, so we
were bound to feel that " darling' might well be similarly harmless . "
the exit . the last phase of the case began after profumo proclaimed
his purity to the house, was warmly patted on the back by the prime
minister, and with his wife, actress valerie hobson, went off to the
races with the queen mother, and later attended a tory ball at
quaglino's, a west end nightclub . but there were editors and m.p.'s
who knew by now that he had lied, and profumo showed himself both
arrogant and stupid in thinking that he could suppress the truth
indefinitely by libel suits . (in fact, he sued paris-match for libel
and collected out of court from italy's tempo illustrato.) besides,
ward began to talk, and to labor m.p . george wigg he unfolded a tale,
as wilson described it in the commons, that " took the lid off a corner
of the london underworld vice and dope, marijuana, blackmail and
counter-blackmail, violence, petty crime . " added wilson gratuituously
: " if ward's statement had been published as a fiction paperback in
america, it would have seemed overdrawn and beyond belief . "  wilson
sent an account of the wardwigg conversation to macmillan, who turned
it over to the " appropriate authorities, " who found nothing
disturbing in it . prodded further, macmillan wrote wilson : " there
seems to be nothing in the papers you sent which requires me to take
any action . /
when john vassall, a homosexual admiralty clerk, was convicted
last october of spying for the russians, macmillan summarily fired the
clerk's superior, thomas galbraith, who had written the clerk some
letters starting " my dear vassall . " galbraith was later wholly
exonerated .
though possibly not in britain, where tropic of cancer has been a
bestseller for months and the unexpurgated lady chatterley's lover has
sold 3,500,000 paperback copies .
even after ward sent wilson, the home
secretary and the entire british press a letter announcing that profumo
had lied to the house of commons, the disclosure " did not seem to make
any impression " on the prime minister . while ordering the lord
chancellor to investigate ward's charges, macmillan assured wilson he
was confident nonetheless that the security question had been " fully
and efficiently watched " although, as wilson accurately pointed out,
mi-5 men apparently knew nothing about christine until they read about
her in the papers . as the dismal facts and alibis tumbled out in the
commons, the adulation and affection the tories had once bestowed on "
macwonder " turned almost visibly to a kind of stupefied pity . at the
end of his defense, macmillan pleaded : " i am entitled to the
sympathetic understanding and confidence of the house and of the
country . " but from the tory benches, as he sat down, came a sound
that was more sigh than cheer . by twos and threes, perturbed
backbenchers went out to argue in the lobbies while several tory
speakers caustically condemned the prime minister . macmillan rose and
with bowed head left the chamber . who next ? some angry tories felt
that macmillan should resign at once, but at a backbenchers' meeting
the view prevailed that, as one cabinet minister put it, " the country
must not get the feeling that he is being hounded out because of
christine keeler . our party would never recover from that . " the
present consensus is that macmillan will be allowed to retire rather
than to resign, some time this summer or fall . in perspective, he may
well remain one of the most successful prime ministers in tory history,
but few conservatives want him in command of their next election
campaign ; even preprofumo, the party had been in bad trouble over
defense muddles, britain's failure to enter the common market, and
above all macmillan's stop-and-go fiscal policies and a sluggish
economy . although macmillan has systematically eliminated rivals by
giving them thankless tasks or sacking them, the tories have a number
of highly plausible successors . currently in the lead (daily express
odds : 4-7) is chancellor of the exchequer reginald maudling, who is
youthful (46) and ready to take credit for a predicted economic spurt
this summer . he is also happily married, a particularly useful
qualification right now . next are deputy prime minister " rab " butler
(2-1), who has all the necessary experience, but at 60 may have been
around too long ; and lord hailsham, bellicose, blimpish science
minister, 55, whose hopes faded rapidly when the government said that
its lords reform bill, which would permit him to sit in the commons,
would not be introduced this summer . ted heath, 46, is generally ruled
out because he is associated with the common market failure, and
besides, he is a bachelor . what next ? any one of these tories could
give labor a good fight in the next election, which does not have to be
held till the fall of 1964 . but laborites feel themselves closer to
power than they have at any time in the last dozen years . at week's
end harold wilson returned to the attack in the commons, demanding an
investigation of the profumo case by a parliamentary select committee
with sweepoing powers . the more limited judicial inquiry proposed by
macmillan, cried wilson, was merely " a cover-up, " because, without
authority to compel proof of the attendance of witnesses, it would have
to collect evidence " from some of the most unmitigated liars in this
country were there any more revelations to come wilson wanted to know
. nothing he knew of right now, said macmillan, but he added : " i
have heard terrible things said of all sorts of people the most
authoritative source of all, christine herself, volunteered : " apart
from those i have already mentioned in my story, i do not know and have
not met any ministers . " macmillan recovered his composure . " they
have deeply wounded me, " he told a tory rally, adding : " it will not
break my spirit . " but the house still remembered the words of tory
rebel nigel birch, who during the big debate had quoted browning's the
lost leader at harold macmillan : let him never come back to us !
there would be doubt, hesitation and pain . forced praise on our part
the glimmer of twilight, never glad confident morning again !

what a labor government would be like it may still be
a long way back to power, but every by-election and opinion poll in
britain today indicates that a growing majority of voters want a labor
government . in a far more prosperous society than the warweary nation
that elected the last labor regime in 1945, the question is what life
would be like under new socialist leaders . curiosity is most intense
among voters under 30, who have been spared memories of the snoek
(canned mock salmon), " reconstituted " eggs and whale steak of
previous laborite austerity . sensing that this new
you-never-had-it-so-good generation is both weary of tory rule and
leary of socialist dogma, the labor program today emphasizes "
pragmatism " and " responsibility " rather than headlong plunges into
doctrinaire experiments . the party's catchwords, a heady blend of
gladstonian rhetoric and new frontier pep talk, call for " a sense of
purpose " to " get britain moving . " how much of its ambitious program
will actually be enacted depends on the kind of majority it can win at
the polls . but there are some fair indications of what labor aims to
do . nationalization state ownership of industry which winston
churchill called that " burglar's jemmy to crack the capitalist crib "
is the goal most commonly associated with a socialist administration .
tory scaremongers even claim that labor already has a " shopping list "
of 104 companies it plans to nationalize . however, after bitter
argument the labor party has abandoned its longtime commitment to
public ownership of the economy's " commanding heights . " it plans now
only to renationalize steel, which was partially restored to private
enterprise by the tories, and britain's trucking industry . the economy
a labor government would demand broad powers to regulate the economy .
it would give manufacturers tax incentives and guaranteed orders for
exports, but would itself build and run pacesetting plants in any
industries, such as machine tools, that it judges inadequate or
inefficient . socialist principle demands a tax on capital gains, which
have been largely immune so far, and possibly even a levy on capital .
in harold wilson's words, britain has a " laissez-faire, soft-center,
speculative, hirepurchase, advertiser-controlled, stop-go economy . "
to change this, labor would have to transform completely the nation's
business life . hence the economist sees labor's economic aims as " at
once consoling and frightening . " to ease the nation's critical dearth
of living space and clear its squalid legacy of slums, labor promises
to commit more public funds to new housing and redevelopment, restore
rent controls, and regulate new construction . labor also aims to break
the age-old power of wealthy landowners, who seldom sell property
outright but give developers long-term leases on which the landlords
continue to collect " ground rent . " new legislation would give all
leaseholders the right to buy actual " freehold " ownership of their
land . europe in theory, the professedly " internationalist " labor
party ought to be for britain's entry into the common market, probably
would have backed it had labor been in power when the issue arose . but
a large segment of labor distrusts catholic europe and suspects that
the common market is a conspiracy to strengthen capitalism . besides,
many ultraconservative british trade unionists fear foreign competition
. a labor administration might be willing to reopen negotiations for
common market membership, but its tougher terms would make britain's
admission more difficult even if de gaulle's opposition were to
diminish . the u.s . & defense labor would " stand firmly " by nato,
and would happily leave the u.s . in charge of the west's nuclear
defense and abandon britain's independent deterrent . admittedly,
britain would become a second-class military power, but wilson
maintains that it can remain " very important " if it develops its
conventional forces . he considers britain's present defenses " more
ineffective and inappropriate than at any time since ethelred the
unready " who failed to deter the danes in 1013 and promises to reequip
and rearm britain's army of the rhine . while the pentagon, dreading
nuclear " proliferation, " is cheered by labor's willingness to
renounce britain's deterrent, this might strengthen labor's vocal
neutralistunilateralist wing . east & west wilson proposes regular
annual summit meetings of u.s., british and soviet heads of state at
the u.n., says that the proposal was warmly received when he visited
moscow this month . labor is irrevocably opposed to giving west germany
nuclear weapons (so is the u.s.) ; it is equally opposed to any
arrangement, such as the u.s . proposal for a multilateral polaris
force, that might ultimately give germans a finger on the nuclear
trigger . though anglophile ludwig erhard is taking over from
anglophobe konrad adenauer, labor's outspoken fear of germany is as
vehement as ever . labor favors nuclear-free zones and thinning out of
forces to reduce tension in central europe, africa, latin america, the
middle east . in europe, however, wilson insists that " disengagement
should not be used by either side to upset the balance of forces . " on
the berlin question, labor agrees with the u.s . that the western
garrison and free access to the city are essential . education &
science labor shrewdly senses that the country pressing need is for a
greatly expanded educational system, both to achieve its ideal of a
classless society and to increase the flow of technicians, scientists
and managers who are vital to economic growth on the scale envisaged by
labor . the party proposes to abolish university fees, start 45 new
universities in 20 years, and greatly expand existing facilities for
technical training and scientific research . " politics, " say
laborites, " is education . /

goddess of the gravel pits
there was another swimming pool in christine keeler's life before the
one at cliveden . as a young girl, she would often swim in the muddy
gravel pits near the dingy, thames-side town of wraysbury . envious of
her looks, her girl friends called her the " goddess of the gravel pits
. " / i remember christine stepping from the water, " says one
childhood chum . " her homemade bikini of yellow jersey wool clung to
her . " from makeshift bikinis to paris originals, the life of
christine keeler was discussed in intimate detail last week, not only
in the house of commons but also in every british newspaper . for all
the sentimental and psychological cliches about a pretty child from a
broken home, what emerged was a circean odyssey of a girl who always
knew what she and what men wanted . bright lights . her parents split
up when she was a child . with her mother, christine moved into a
converted bus coach near the thames that was little more than a shanty
on wheels . even then, christine's eye was on the main chance . often
she would climb up on the knee of a neighbor and beg to be told about
the bright lights in the big cities . " she was forever asking me to
tell her stories about life in london, " recalls the neighbor . /
i spent hours telling her about her
dreamland . " christine eventually took a job in a london dress house .
at a small soho cafe called the zodiac, she met a spanish waiter named
carlo, began spending weekends with him at his seedy soho boardinghouse
. then a girl friend introduced her to a u.s . air force sergeant . "
night after night we whooped it up with the yanks, " recalls the friend
. " they were twelve very gay months . " but christine got pregnant,
gave birth prematurely to a son she called peter . the infant died six
days later . christine was just 17 . out of work and short of cash,
christine became the mistress of a rich rollsroyce-driving real estate
man, who set her up in a luxurious flat off baker street . but the
affair proved unsatisfactory, and she went to work as a waitress, then
as a showgirl in murray's cabaret club . " and then, " christine said,
/ i began meeting my first interesting male companions . /
no man's collar . one was stephen
ward, and a few months after they met in 1959, christine moved into his
flat in wimpole mews . " it was a sort of brother-and-sister
relationship, " said christine, " nothing else . " a feature of ward's
apartment was a one-way mirror permitting observation of the bedroom
from the living room ; this elaborate peephole was covered by a
picture of buddha when not in use . " that was installed by an old
eccentric who used to own this place, " ward said . " i'm going to have
it filled in . " an elaborate practical joker, ward often put a dog
collar around christine's neck and led her around london on a leash .
sometimes christine received guests wearing nothing but skintight blue
jeans, once gave a party at which all the guests sat drinking champagne
in her bathroom . one of her thirstiest friends was evgeny ivanov .
though he was a bit of a prig, ivanov was a devoted reader of the
steamy james bond novels, found them amusing but ridiculous . " he
professed to dislike loose women, did not like christine even to use
cosmetics . but one hot july night, recalls christine, ivanov finally "
came to forsake all his principles and his pride . suddenly he was
kissing me, rolling his dark curls into my neck . . . " afterward,
ivanov was " sad, very sad . " charming but wary . that very same
weekend christine had met jack profumo for the first times at cliveden,
and christine, who was visiting ward at his cottage on the grounds, was
stealing a nude moonlight swim in astor's pool . suddeny bill astor
appeared with some guests, including profumo . frantically clutching a
towel around her dripping self, christine was introduced to both jack
and his wife, valerie hobson . " she was very charming, " said
christine, " but seemed wary of me . " next day, christine brought
ivanov out to cliveden, and the russian and profumo held a swimming
race, which jack only won by cheating . " that will teach you to trust
the british government, " profumo told ivanov . later that same day, he
asked christine for her telephone number ; she told him to get it from
ward .
jack and christine met
several times in ward's flat . " mentally, we became very close, " said
christine . it happened, just like it happened with ivanov . at least
that is how christine told it in the news of the world : " there was
one of those electric, potent silences, and he was kissing me and i was
returning his kisses with everything i suddenly felt for him . " once,
when valerie was in ireland on holiday, profumo took christine to his
house in regent's park . " we crept around the lovely rooms and then we
got to their bedroom . " marvellous place . christine also cavorted
with members of london's vast west indian contingent, had affairs with
jamaican johnnie edgecombe and singer lucky gordon . " when i first met
her, " said gordon, " she was asking the waitress in a cafe where she
could get some indian hemp (marijuana) . knowing this, i wanted to know
her . " there were a number of others . scotland yard is said to have
christine's notebook, and the notebook is said to be full of names .
throughout, christine never forgot the gravel pits or mum . when she
took temporary refuge in spain last march, christine sent a postcard
home .
/ marvellous place, /
she wrote . " lots of nicelooking men . don't worry, having a ball
since
then, the ball has continued, more or less, and so has fame . at the
cassius clay fight at wembley stadium last week, there was a sudden
flurry as a glamorous woman swept to her ringside seat . " is that
christine keeler ? " asked a spectator . " no, " said his neighbor, "
only elizabeth taylor . /

russia women are different to hear the russians tell it, all the
world's women were in chains before valentina vladimirovna tereshkova .
as the first woman cosmonaut looped the earth, tass exulted : " a
brilliant star has flared up in the cosmic firmament . it outshines all
the film stars in the world . never and in no country did women ever
attain such height . " in every russian village, women celebrated, and
congratulations were fired aloft from such soviet heroines as lyubi li,
described in the press as " the renowned corn planter and hero
of socialist labor . " in her space capsule, vostok vi, " valya " was
still the compleat soviet woman . her space suit was embroidered with a
snow-white dove, and she had had her hair done before blastoff . once a
tomboy, she now has an admitted weakness for spiked heels, stylish
clothes, and a perfume called red moscow . from space she radioed
ground control : " please tell mamma not to worry . " once, when
ground scientists lost contact with " seagull " (valya's orbital call
name), they hastily ordered her cosmic companion in vostok v, lieut .
colonel valery feodorovich bykovsky, to try and rouse her . " sorry, i
was having a snooze, " apologized valya . missed rendezvous . over
their radios, valya and valery sang songs of friendship to each other,
flashed " best wishes to the industrious american people " and " warm
greetings to the multimillioned chinese . " loosening their harnesses,
both cosmonauts performed calisthenics while floating weightlessly in
their cabins . but though the two vostoks passed within three miles of
each other, their orbital paths were so divergent that they could not
rendezvous . since u.s . scientists had fully expected the two capsules
to link up in space, they speculated that soviet scientists had made a
launching miscalculation . three days and 48 orbits after takeoff,
valya re-entered the atmosphere, was ejected from her capsule and
floated to earth by parachute near a small village in kazakhstan ;
slowed by another parachute, the empty vostok vi landed near by . two
hours and 46 minutes later and some 500 miles away, bykovsky landed
similarly in the meadow of a collective farm after a record 81 orbits
and 119 hours aloft . but bykovsky was all but forgotten in the furor
over valya . television commentators described her " cornflower blue
eyes, " and peasants showered her with bouquets . overcome by her
welcome, valya broke into tears ; it was the first time, moscow
assured the world, that anyone had seen her cry since she was a child .
in a telephone conversation with nikita khrushchev, she admitted that
she had bruised her nose in landing, said that the " people received me
very cordially in the russian manner with bread and salt . "
foresightedly, she had brought along photographs of herself and passed
them out to workers who greeted her, giving most of the pictures to
women . " i prefer women today, " she said . " the men shouldn't
complain . " when she flew into moscow for her official reception three
days later, valya was greeted by more flowers than anyone had ever
remembered seeing before in the russian capital, a bear hug and kiss
from khrushchev, and her best beau, bachelor cosmonaut andrian
nikolayev . paper dolls . though russia's second double shot added
little new to space technology, the fact that valya was not a pilot and
admittedly was mechanically unsophisticated raised the question of why
u.s . astronauts all must be skilled test pilots . the answer from nasa
officials : use of test pilots permits the elimination of
space-consuming automatic equipment in the cramped capsules . but some
authorities are convinced that young scientists would be far more
effective in observing and analyzing unexpected space flight
phenomena. says clinton anderson, chairman of the senate space
committee : " the russians have proved to us that you don't have to
have 20 years of test-pilot experience before you can handle one of
these capsules fervent agreement was voiced by u.s . feminists . said
jane hart, wife of michigan senator philip hart and leader in the fight
to get women astronauts accepted by solidly misogynistic nasa : " i'm
tempted to go out to the barn and tell the story to my horse and listen
to him laugh . " added clare boothe luce : " we must stop trying to
make paper dolls of our women . " anthropologist margaret mead warned
: " the russians treat men and women interchangeably . we treat men
and women differently . " and vive la difference, said at least one
russian male last week . " my age and conservative mental makeup
compelled me to think up to the last few days that we men were the
rulers of man's mind and the salt of the earth, " said novelist mikhail
(and quiet flows the don) sholokhov . " and what do we see now ? a
woman in space ! say what you will, this is incomprehensible . it
contradicts all my set conceptions of the world and its possibilities .
many scientists
doubt astronaut gordon cooper's report of seeing trucks on the road
and smoke coming out of chimneys in tibet . according to dr . w . r .

communists now for the main event nikita khrushchev had more
reasons last week to wonder why he ever invited a red chinese
delegation to moscow . twenty-five reasons, to be exact, all neatly
numbered in a letter for convenient " point-by-point discussion " at
the scheduled sino-soviet meeting next week . mao tse-tung's latest
message to nikita the most vehement to date in the continuing quarrel
doomed the confrontation to failure before it began . peking
deliberately left the kremlin no room for compromise . after years of
discussion over whether the split was real, western skeptics could no
longer doubt that it was deep, jagged, and unbridgeable for a long time
to come . parrot & stick . in 24,000 brazenly contemptuous words, mao
accused khrushchev of spawning a new personality cult worse than
stalin's, assailed the kremlin for " great power chauvinism and
economic pressure " against other red nations, charged the soviets with
trying to purge foreign communist parties . exclaimed red china : "
what is all this if not subversion ? " at the same time, peking was
not above attempting some subversion of its own . appealing to moscow's
east european satellites, the statement declared : " if a party cannot
use its brains to think for itself, but instead is a party that parrots
the words of others, runs hither and thither in response to the baton
of certain persons abroad, such a party is incapable of leading the
masses . " the crux of the chinese dispute with russia remained
moscow's propaganda line of peaceful coexistence with the west . this
policy, said peking scornfully, was plucked out of " some mystical book
from heaven " ; moreover, those who dare to disagree are treated " as
heretics deserving to be burned at the stake . how can the chinese
communists agree ? they cannot . it is impossible . " as always,
peking stuck to the dogma that the road to violent revolution in
africa, asia and latin america was the only path a true marxist could
follow . as for soviet charges of warmongering, the red chinese replied
with an argument that, ironically, echoed some pentagon strategists .
brush-fire wars, declared peking, need not necessarily escalate into an
all-out nuclear struggle . truth was, declared the manifesto, the
russians were too selfish and scared to risk their bourgeois gains in
far-off battles . " to put it bluntly, " said red china, " whoever
considers that a revolution can be made only if everything is plain
sailing, only if there is an advance guarantee against failure, is
certainly not a revolutionary . " keep talking . peking's punch was
neatly timed to catch the kremlin off balance . it landed on the eve of
a special central committee meeting called to discuss russia's internal
ideological troubles . for four days the russians were stunned and
speechless . finally the central committee angrily announced that it
would not even bother to publish red china's " distorted, unwarranted
attack . " chinese communist newspapers triumphantly headlined russia's
refusal to print the chinese document . even russia's vaunted space
feats were nothing that nikita could take credit for . " during the
stalin era he was a thirdor even fourth-rate man, " the newspaper
reported . " he had nothing to do with nuclear and space developments .
/ in russia's own bailiwick, the chinese reds also stayed on the
offensive . communist rumania, which has been feuding with the kremlin
over moscow's interference in its economic affairs, gleefully published
a lengthy summary of the red chinese indictment . peking's embassy in
moscow boldly distributed russian-language copies of its manifesto .
callers were greeted by an attache, and after a polite chat over tea,
got as many translations of the 63-page document as they wanted .

the ukrainian candidates the khrushchev succession sweepstakes
began all over again last week when the communist party central
committee named two new secretaries . out in front is soviet president
leonid brezhnev, 56, a shrewd, swarthy metallurgical engineer whom
khrushchev plucked from an obscure job in the ukraine little more than
a decade ago . brezhnev will now probably give up the merely ceremonial
functions of the soviet presidency, take over as taskmaster of heavy
industry and armaments . the second new secretary is ukrainian party
boss nikolai podgorny, 60, who is expected to take over the supervision
of party cadres . both men were already members of the central
committee's inner sanctum, the presidium . now, as secretaries of the
committee as well, they move into the most elite echelon of the soviet
hierarchy . only four other red leaders hold such a double position,
and none is khrushchev's likely successor . the four : frol kozlov,
54, who suffered a severe stroke in april ; elderly otto kuusinen, 81
; senior theoretician mikhail suslov, 60, compromised by a stalinist
past; and khrushchev himself .

italy epitaph for the apertura italy last week had a
premier, but no leader, a cabinet, but no effective government, and a
parliament that may well be dissolved without passing a single
significant law . the nation faced the prospect of political turmoil
unmatched since the communist bid for power was turned back in 1948 .
shut tight was the risky apertura a sinistra (opening to the left),
with no new apertura in sight in any particular direction . broad jump
. the left-center opening was created 17 months ago by leftwing
christian democrats in alliance with pietro nenni's socialists and with
the tacit consent of the vatican . the idea was that this coalition
enact overdue " reforms " in agriculture, education and finance,
backed by the socialists but opposed by italy's right-wing parties . at
the same time, the christian democrats, somewhat naively machiavellian,
hoped to separate nenni from his longtime communist allies . nenni, a
practical political jumper, seemed ready to leap again . he had been a
pal of mussolini's when both were young fascists ; he soon broke with
il duce (who nearly had him shot), fought against the communists until
the early '30s, made up with them after the war, when he took most of
his party into the red camp . (the remaining anti-communist socialists
formed italy's social democratic party under giuseppe saragat.) after
hungary, nenni again partly broke with the communists . now, at 72, he
was toying with bourgeois respectability by cooperating with the center
parties but his own followers were not so eager . they might own cars
or go skiing at st . moritz, but most of them still hankered for
alliance with the communists a feeling that was reinforced by massive
red gains in the recent national elections . nenni made a deal with
premierdesignate aldo moro for the socialists' 87 votes in the chamber
of deputies . moro's christian democrats would support socialist
demands for 15 new regional governments, even though it meant that in
some key industrial regions socialists could wind up in joint control
with the communists . nenni in turn promised support for italian
participation in nato, although many if not most of nenni's socialists
really want a neutralist italy . quick switch . meeting to ratify the
moro-nenni contract, members of the socialist party central committee
trooped into a basement hall of an ancient roman villa near the bank of
the tiber . from the start, there was trouble . " you say you have an
agreement on regional governments, " shouted a heckler at nenni, " but
you don't say when . " hastily moving on to foreign affairs, nenni told
his grumbling followers that " the atlantic pact is one of the elements
upon which rests a troubled peace a troubled peace, if you like, " he
added quickly, " but one which has avoided the outbreak of war .
at that heresy, there was open revolt
from the pro-communist carristi (literally " tank drivers, " a nickname
derived from the red tanks that crushed the hungarian rebellion) .
alone, they did not have the votes to defeat nenni, but now longtime no
. 2 man riccardo lombardi, eagerly eying the no . 1 spot, also opposed
nenni . the argument raged for 8f hours . by 5 : 30 a.m., nenni was
defeated and the alliance with the christian democrats had collapsed .
the old man submitted his resignation on the spot . it was not
accepted, but that hardly mattered . to president antonio segni, moro
reported that, after 24 days of trying, he would be unable to form a
new leftcenter coalition . communist boss palmiro togliatti was
jubilant over the chaos, called for a popular front government . at the
same time he urged reds to " harvest your neighbors' gardens, " which
meant wooing the divided, demoralized socialists in the wine shops,
factories and fields . liberal leader giovanni malagodi, whose small,
free-enterprise party doubled its share of the vote (from 3.5 per cent
to 7 per cent ) in the april elections, pledged to open the eyes of "
all those italians who are still prisoners of the marxist dream,
including those whom the christian democrats are drawing into socialism
. " as a last resort, segni turned over the task of forming a new
government to the affable president of the chamber of deputies,
giovanni leone, a middle-of-the-road christian democrat and the first
neapolitan premier . like any son of naples, leone enjoys singing ;
with ex-premier amintore fanfani at the piano, he has crooned
neapolitan love songs to such visiting dignitaries as averell harriman
and harold macmillan . short message . after one day, leone succeeded
in forming a government . it was a minority cabinet of 22 christian
democrats, mostly " technicians, " that would stay in office at least
long enough to approve a new budget and to greet president kennedy .
after that, the parliament will recess for the summer while christian
democrats debate whether to gamble on recouping their recent losses by
holding new national elections this fall . sadly, moro wrote an epitaph
for the apertura : " the socialist party drew back because it cannot
conceive of a political line of its own that does not enjoy, directly
or indirectly, the approval of the communist party . today one cannot
count upon the socialist party for the solution of italy's political
problems . /

israel vale atque ave in jerusalem, halo-haired premier david
ben-gurion, 76, handed in his resignation for the eighth time in his 15
years in office . israel was not unduly disturbed, since ben-gurion is
as famed for resignations as for such other idiosyncrasies as standing
on his head and advocating friendly relations with germans . but what
startled people and politicians this time was the fact that ben-gurion
also gave up his parliamentary seat in the knesset, an act that would
leave him ineligible for future cabinet office . asked why, bengurion
firmly replied, " personal needs . i propose to keep them to myself . "
weary chief . in fact, ben-gurion was weary of politics and disturbed
by a rising generation that questions his leadership . his mapai party
was irrevocably split by the 1960-61 lavon affair, which also tangled
the army in politics. ben-gurion has continually had to arbitrate
disputes and pacify antagonists . finally, he has nearly despaired of
reducing the multiplicity of parties (15 in all), despite his argument
that " if the u.s . with huge population can get along with two
parties, why can't we with only 2,000,000 people ? " b-g " was not
too weary of politics to hand-pick his successor : ukrainianborn
finance minister lev eshkol, 67, who has brought israel from a
hand-tomouth economy to the point where its gross national product has
risen an average of 11 per cent annually over the past five years, and
its dollar surplus is almost an embarrassment . twice married but now a
widower, eshkol has four daughters, one of whom teaches dancing in
jerusalem, while another is a sergeant in the israeli army . his new
cabinet strongly resembles ben-gurion's old one, and it is unlikely
there will be any radical changes in foreign or domestic policy . a far
more adaptable man than ben-gurion, eshkol will probably govern more
through compromise than by fiat . pet project . the governmental
transition might have been uneventful except that, sure enough,
ben-gurion suddenly withdrew his resignation from the knesset, on
condition that he would only attend parliamentary sessions if he felt
like it . neither eshkol nor the opposition politicians were too happy
about ben-gurion's keeping his foot in the door . now, should eshkol
falter or a crisis threaten, ben-gurion might charge back into office
to save the country from alleged disaster . meanwhile, ben-gurion plans
to live at the sde boker kibbutz in the bleak negev desert and turn out
books on everything from jewish history to his own autobiography . he
hopes also to further his pet project : the " cultural absorption " of
jewish immigrants from asia and north africa into israel's
predominantly western society . ben-gurion argues that unless the
oriental jews are educated faster, israel may turn into a typically "
indolent " levantine state within ten years .
israeli defense
minister pinhas lavon was forced from office in 1955 on allegations
that he disastrously bungled an israeli espionage abroad, presumably in
egypt . lavon pleaded that he had been framed by highly placed
political enemies . he was finally cleared two years ago by the israeli
cabinet, over ben-gurion's violent objections .

communists the place is berlin, the problem is
peking anticipating president kennedy's tumultuous west berlin
reception, nikita khrushchev hastily arranged a trip of his own . he
decided to go to east berlin, ostensibly to celebrate the 70th birthday
of east germany's spadebearded communist boss walter ulbricht . just 48
hours after kennedy, on the west side of the wall, had cried, " i am a
berliner, " khrushchev arrived on the east side, bent on showing that
he was a berliner too . but the thin welcoming crowd was not exactly
eager to make him an honorary citizen . minutes before khrushchev's
turboprop landed at schonefeld airport, an announcer drilled the
spectators in a proper greeting : " now, when our friend steps out of
his plane, we will all cheer in unison, hip, hip, hurrah . " when
nikita stepped out of his plane, all smiles, the crowd was silent and
only the honor guard of soldiers shouted, officially . in contrast to
president kennedy's welcome by more than a million west berliners, a
scant 250,000 east berlin factory workers, secretaries and
schoolchildren, marching in closed formations, turned out for
khrushchev . along parts of the 16-mile route to the red city hall, the
only spectators were the volkspolizei . the real reason for
khrushchev's presence in east berlin, of course, was not that he wanted
to help ulbricht blow out the candles, nor was it entirely a matter of
trying to counteract the emotions stirred up by the kennedy visit .
most of all, khrushchev wanted to meet with his east european satellite
chiefs to close ranks before the chinese arrive in moscow this week to
confer on the worsening sino-soviet ideological split . distribution
problem . their dispute grew so angry last week that moscow resorted to
expelling chinese diplomats, a treatment hitherto reserved for western
representatives . behind this latest explosion was a 24,000-word peking
blast at khrushchev's policies, designed to show that his peaceful
coexistence line is a cowardly betrayal of true red revolutionaries,
that he is shilly-shallying with the " paper tigers " of imperialism,
and that he is " subverting " other communist parties . when the
russians refused to publish the peking letter, issued two weeks ago,
the chinese embassy in moscow started circulating copies, thereby
provoking the kremlin to throw out three embassy attaches and two other
chinese . peking called the action " unreasonable and untenable, "
noted that it was " unprecedented in the history of the relations
between our two socialist countries, " and accused moscow of
deliberately trying to create obstacles to the scheduled talks . even
as khrushchev arrived in east berlin, the chinese embassy there went
right ahead distributing copies of the peking manifesto to interested
bystanders .
stalin's ghost . on
hand for talks with khrushchev in east berlin were the satellite chiefs
of poland, czechoslovakia, hungary and bulgaria . absent, at least from
among early arrivals : rumanian red boss gheorghe gheorghiudej, who is
not only feuding with moscow over economic planning but is warm toward
peking, allowed its manifesto to appear in the rumanian press . what
confronted the small-scale red summit meeting was the picture of the
sino-soviet rift tearing into the communist fabric all over the world .
in moscow, a massive international convocation of female comrades found
the russia-china issue a cause for nearhysteria (see following story) .
such red front organizations as the world federation of trade unions
and the world peace council have also started squabbling over the issue
. in asia, africa and latin america, many communist parties are feeling
the split ; where communism has prospered by appearing " moderate, "
party leaders bluntly denounce red china and are beginning to purge
peking partisans . even in western europe's overwhelmingly pro-moscow
parties, some young reds have responded to peking's revolutionary zeal,
have joined red chinese " friendship societies . " khrushchev himself
busily counterattacked against the chinese . before his berlin trip, at
a central committee meeting in moscow whose chief task was to cope with
the restlessness of russia's own intellectuals, khrushchev dealt with
the more urgent peking problem . typically, he interpreted president
kennedy's " strategy of peace " speech at the american university last
month as a sign of western weakness, used it as evidence that his
policy of peaceful coexistence is paying off . the red chinese, said
khrushchev, are really pessimists in pursuing a now-or-never
revolutionary dogma, because they wouldn't be in such a desperate hurry
to start wars and revolutions if they really believed in the
long-range, inevitable victory of communism . moreover, they use " the
national, racial approach " in widening the schism between communists .
khrushchev also heatedly defended his destalinization drive, attacked
mao tse-tung (without naming him) for building his own cult of
personality . said khrushchev, raising his favorite ghost : " we are
against leaders who believe that they have been sent by god, and that
the people are a mass that must listen only to them and applaud . that
was typical of stalin . " amid these exchanges, the atmosphere could
scarcely be more unpleasant for the scheduled sino-soviet encounter
this week if indeed both parties are not too angry to go through with
it . the split, western observers were careful to point out, was still
not " final and formal . " but as an informal quarrel, it seemed to be
at least in the quarter-finals .

the women's club the belles and battle-axes of communism gathered
last week at the kremlin for the world women's congress . there were
2,000 delegates from more than a hundred lands . buxom russian comrades
in flowered prints mingled with bantus in striped robes . cute young
chicks from rome and bologna sat next to iron-jawed veterans who had
stuck hatpins in policemen's horses in long-ago street riots in berlin
and buenos aires, melbourne and madrid . some seemed to have gentled
with age . dolores ibarruri, 68, the firebrand who was known as la
pasionaria in the spanish civil war, now looks like someone's kind old
grandmother . others have made the change, at least outwardly, from red
amazons to reasonably fashionable women : slim, touslehaired jeannette
vermeersch, wife of france's red boss maurice thorez, could have
stepped out of the galeries lafayette, if not dior . once-dowdy lotte
ulbricht, married to east germany's lackluster president, could pass as
a well-to-do provincial hausfrau, and india's aruna asaf ali looked
striking in silk, making it hard to believe that as a dedicated
saboteur she once moved the british to put a price of 10,000 rupees on
her head . " our congress is a manifestation of charming womanhood,
motherly warmth, moral and physical beauty ! " gushed la pasionaria,
quite a little off the mark . above all, the congress was a
manifestation of the ever-widening sinosoviet split . italian flight .
as usual, the dispute was between the khrushchev line, which holds that
to avoid nuclear disaster capitalism must be fought through peaceful
means, and the mao tse-tung line, which demands an aggressive policy,
even at the risk of war . coming on in the first session at the
kremlin's modern hall of congresses, japan's kimono-clad fuki kushida
demanded the withdrawal of u.s . " aggressive forces " from south viet
nam, formosa, okinawa, africa, latin america and the middle east . in a
simpler period of communist history, this might have passed almost
unnoticed as the standard line, east or west . but now there was a
sudden movement on the floor, and out of the hall stalked 50 of the
finest, most peace-loving italian females ever gathered in one bunch at
the kremlin . what was bothering them ? a trim roman blonde explained
: " we are here as women to work for peace and not to engage in cold
war polemics . " more to the point, japan's communist party is one of
those aligned with red china, and italy's red ladies were unmistakably
showing their solidarity with comrade nikita in the sino-soviet fight .
red china's yang yun-yu returned the ball to the soviets by lashing the
u.s . for using nuclear blackmail " to enslave the world, " attacking
john kennedy for his cunning " strategy " to divide china and the
soviet union, and insisting that the foremost problem was not peaceful
coexistence but maintaining the active struggle against imperialism . "
how, " she demanded, " can the oppressed coexist with their oppressors
? " lotte ulbricht replied that madame yang was way off base . no one
was demanding that oppressed nations live happily with their
oppressors, she said, and added that russia was, as always, "
wholeheartedly behind the revolutionary struggles of colonial peoples .
/ on the third day, india's aruna asaf ali charged china with blocking
all efforts to settle the himalayan war with india . out of their seats
bounced two diminutive chinese delegates who legged it to the platform
in slit skirts to demand time for rebuttal, their heated words duly
translated by an interpreter . a russian official frantically wrapped
her hands around the microphone ; british chairman dr . joan carritt
vainly jangled a bell ; pro-soviet delegates added to the uproar by
shouting that the chinese should stand down . male wall . the only
people paying attention to the bitter chinese complaints were a group
of western newsmen . the sight of outsiders overhearing the family
quarrel brought fiery jeannette vermeersch to her feet and, pointing an
accusing finger, she cried to the chinese delegates : " you are
talking in front of the imperialist press and yet you say that you are
fighting imperialism ! " strong-armed russian males formed a human
wall between the reporters and the chinese as the exasperated chairman
adjourned the meeting . the role of peacemaker fell to guinea's jeanne
martin, president of the panafrican women's conference, who got the
chinese ladies off the platform by promising them a later chance to
speak . despite all those ideological differences, a non-communist male
who has ever had anything to do with a women's organization could not
escape the uncomfortable feeling that the red ladies were acting
somewhat like organization women . at week's end the mood grew beyond
even predictable feminine excitement . the congress went into secret
session, hoping to hammer out its differences behind closed doors . the
attempt failed . when the majority agreed on an appeal for peace and
against the arms race, but failed to denounce the u.s . or nato, the
chinese delegates and their albanian allies voted against, and remained
stubbornly seated while the crowd of 5,000 jumped to their feet, waved
handkerchiefs and clapped rhythmically in a 50-minute demonstration .
china's madame yang then mounted the podium to explain her vote, but
was drowned out by angry shouts and finally ruled out of order .

great britain while the prisoner sketched in
jail, he lived like the prince of ponces . for 56[ a day, he was able
under british prison regulations to get a cell with a soft bed, a
carpet on the concrete floor, curtains on the barred window, an
armchair, and another prisoner to clean up after him . during the three
weeks stephen ward was in jail, john profumo had been disgraced, evgeny
ivanov expelled from the communist party and packed off to a russian
mental hospital, and christine keeler successfully screen-tested for
the proposed " dramatized documentary " of her life . but last week
artist-osteopath ward, the fourth member of what labor party leader
harold wilson eloquently called " this dingy quadrilateral, " at last
held center stage . handcuffed and wearing sunglasses, ward stuck his
tongue out at photographers as he was led into london's marylebone
magistrates' court for a hearing to decide whether his case should be
referred to the old bailey for trial . the charge : eight counts of
procuring, living off the earnings of prostitutes, running a brothel
and arranging abortions . in his opening statement, prosecutor mervyn
griffith-jones warned that the hearing would unfold a " somewhat sordid
story . " it was sordid all right and more than somewhat . see jim . a
parade of girls tall, short, blond, brunette, redheaded took the stand
. but, inevitably, the star witnesses were christine keeler and marilyn
( " mandy " ) rice-davies . during christine's testimony, ward quietly
sketched her from the dock . christine said that between lovers of her
own, she would stay platonically with ward at his wimpole mews flat . "
we were like brother and sister, " she said, but fraternally, ward kept
her supplied with men . " my life used to revolve around stephen from
the moment i got up until the moment i went to bed, " she said . " i
thought i could never stand on my feet unless he was there to support
me mentally . " ward told her it was all right for a girl to sleep with
a man for money as long as she did not get the " prostitute mentality .
/ though payment for services ranged up to $140, half of which usually
went to ward, she said : " i have never considered myself a call girl
or prostitute . " sometimes when ward " complained about having no
money, " christine testified, she would simply say : " i'll go see jim
. " he was a wealthy businessman, who had paid her " hundreds of
pounds, " but the name might well have been jack . profumo also gave
her money, " but not for myself ; it was for my mother . " miss x .
christine said that she took up modeling so that she could keep meeting
girls to introduce to ward . often when she and ward were out walking,
/ he used to tell me which girl he liked in a shop and say " go and get
her . " ' christine would introduce the girls to ward under the guise
that he was her brother or that he wanted to sketch them . ward would
then seduce the girls and later discuss their talents with christine .
/ he used to say " that was wonderful, " ' she said . " she's good,
she's not bad, she's fantastic,' something like that .
while the
prisoner sketched add as griffith-jones and his witnesses told it, ward
was occasionally turned down . once a shopgirl balked when he wanted
her to go to a party " where she would see girls tied up and whipped .
/ another time, ward told a " young lady of the utmost respectability,
/ said the prosecutor, that he had a two-way mirror in his flat through
which one could see into the bedroom from the living room, added he
hoped to make money from people who would pay to watch . taking the
stand herself later, the girl a tall brunette wearing ski pants,
identified only as a certain " miss x " recalled telling ward that she
was not in the least interested in watching that kind of thing . " my
darling, " ward replied, " i don't want you to watch . i want you to
perform . " always bill . perhaps the most extraordinary thing about
all this was the unlikely association between ward and his aristocratic
friend, viscount astor . christine startled the jammed courtroom by
testifying that when she and mandy were once sharing a flat, their rent
was partly paid by none other than astor himself . son of combative,
convivial nancy astor, britain's first woman m.p., young astor grew up
at the center of britain's social and political worlds . his uncle is
proprietor of the london times, his brother editor of the observer .
the " cliveden set " was famed in the '30s not only for its appeasing
politics but its intellectual sparkle ; and charming, generous bill
astor tried to carry on the tradition . his celebrated parties freely
mixed writers, artists, politicians and aristocrats . but the
thrice-married astor (currently to bronwen pugh, former top london
model) was never really intellectually attuned to his sophisticated
circle, which is perhaps why he allowed ward to penetrate the fringes
of the cliveden set and rented him a cottage on the grounds . the
worlds of the astors and of ward frequently overlapped in the garden
and at the swimming pool, where bill astor often seemed to have more
fun than with his own respectable guests . in her testimony, mandy said
that she had slept with astor . ward always said, mandy declared, that
though he did not have any money, " we have always got bill, who can
help us . " under crossexamination, mandy was told that astor had
denied her allegation . she replied quickly : " he would, wouldn't he
?
in a letter to the times, the
head of one london model school protested against " the new and grossly
unfair newspaper practice of calling any woman a " model' who so
describes herself and so libeling the profession . with far more
justification than the newspapers have shown, the model girls of this
agency are now referring to miss keeler as the " wellknown journalist .

neuer on sonday perhaps what the england of christine keeler and

language of the scottish bigamy act (1551), few offenders are more
frowned upon than " thame that maryis twa sindrie wyfis or husbandis
levand togiddir undervorsit (undivorced) . " under the act, punishment
is fixed at " confiscatious of all theair gudis mouabill of their
persounis for yeir and day . " also, they may " neuer habill to bruke
(never again bear) office of honour, dignitie nor benefice . " as it
happens, this harsh treatment has not been meted out for monny a year
lang syne, but the scots' ancient law is still on the books . last
week, along with 166 other cobwebbed statutes adopted by the scottish
kingdom before it joined england in 1707, the law was being repealed in
the british parliament . for all their moral granite, the scots clearly
had their problems 1 statute, designed to curb rebellious youth,
decreed that any " sonne or daughter above age of sextein yeers not
being distracted (demented) shall beate or curse their father or mother
shall be put to death without mercy . " on the other hand, the loss of
some of the old laws might be said, from a dour point of view, to
contribute to modern decadence . among them : repeal of a prohibition

sweden gentleman spy the tall, coldly handsome swedish aviator
was a familiar figure on the washington cocktail circuit . as swedish
air attache from 1952 to 1957, he impressed one u.s . air force general
as " easy and outgoing, an extravert who got along very well . " west
pointers found him " spoony " meaning suave . he played a cool, quiet
game of golf at the army-navy club, his balding, white-fringed head
bent over his putter as generals and admirals chatted . his
conversation was hardly memorable, except that he worried aloud and a
lot about radicals and leftists . when he went home, the u.s .
government presented him with the customary legion of merit for his "
furtherance of amicable relationships between the royal swedish air
force and the u.s . air force . " last week, as colonel stig erik
constans wennerstrom, 56, awaited trial as a soviet spy, it was
suddenly clear that his relationships had been most amicable east of
the iron curtain . what damage ? when swedish agents arrested him, he
admitted he had been on the soviet payroll for a full 15 years not only
as an air attache but after 1957 as chief of the air section in the
swedish ministry of defense, and since 1961 as a foreign ministry
consultant . though he drew only $9,000 annual pay, he lived in a
$40,000 house in stockholm's exclusive djursholm district, among bank
directors and diplomats, entertained frequently . money was a motive
(he may have earned as much as $100,000 for his work), but one
acquaintance said : " he must have enjoyed the dangerous game and
thought he was intellectually better than others . " what damage could
wennerstrom's game have done to the u.s., nato, and his own country ?
though sweden is not a nato member, wennerstrom had contact with danish
and norwegian military men, probably knew a lot about the nato defenses
and weapons . he also knew swedish defense sites and strengths, had
access to key mobilization and communication plans . in washington, he
had access among other things, to detailed information on the u.s .
army's hawk, radar-guided antiaircraft missile designed to knock down
low-flying supersonic planes . the russians are working hard to perfect
a defense against low-level nuclear attack, and the hawk could help
them . more proof ? swedish minister of defense sven andersson was
suspicious of wennerstrom for two years prior to his arrest, but
premier tage erlander was not informed until after agents had picked up
wennerstrom on the way to his office . as opposition critics pounced,
erlander went on television to explain : " it is impossible for the
government to be informed of every person who is under suspicion . we
need more proof in a democratic society before we can take action . "
it sounded like a lame excuse to liberals and conservatives, who
demanded a parliamentary investigation . meanwhile, always the
gentleman, wennerstrom reportedly asked his attorney to send back his
legion of merit, calmly faced a probable life sentence for " gross
espionage .

france the - brotherhood the grandeur that is gaullism has
always defied simple explanation, for it often seems that charles de
gaulle, like the cabots, speaks only to god . in a witty new book, the
gaullists ritual and directory, french journalist pierre
viansson-ponte, chief political correspondent for prestigious le monde,
pokes skillfully at the inner gaullist mysteries . the movement,
vianssonponte concludes, " consists neither of a doctrine nor of an
organization, but simply of an experience lived through . " the high
mass, sung . the most telling experience for gaullists is to be in de
gaulle's presence, which is surrounded by an inflexible liturgy .
guardian of the " christian morality and social propriety " of the
ritual is mme . de gaulle . " she checks the necklines of the
ministers' wives, " says author vianssonponte, " and has at various
times, it is said, succeeded in keeping out of the government people
suspected of marital infidelity . " at luncheon at de gaulle's country
home in colombey-les-deuxeglises, " mme . de gaulle asks about the
road, talks about the weather,the general . the general asks about the
road,talks about the weather, himself . " with its planted questions
and prepared answers, a de gaulle press conference is like " a high
mass, sung . " the resignation of a gaullist who has outlived his
usefulness is " an order ; it is not disputed . " what is remarkable
about all this, says viansson-ponte, is that although de gaulle has
absolute power, he does not abuse it . that may help to explain the
loyalty of his followers, bound together only by their participation in
at least two of gaullism's three great adventures : the free french
resistance ; de gaulle's postwar rassemblement du peuple francais
(r.p.f.) and its abortive bid for political power ; and the formation
of the fifth republic . viansson-ponte estimates that only 1,500
frenchmen qualify as real gaullists, has selected 116 of these for
inclusion in his directory . even in apostasy, he says, the gaullist "
link is indestructible . excluded, exiled, in rebellion, jacques
soustelle remains a member of the circle . " but ironically, such
ranking spokesmen for present-day gaullist policy as foreign minister
maurice couve de murville and information minister alain peyrefitte are
excluded for lacking the proper credentials . crossing the desert .
viansson-ponte gives each gaullist a guide michelin sort of rating
denoting past services to gaullism and present standing in relation to
the general . a cross of lorraine indicates free france, a submachine
gun the resistance, and a star the compagnon de la liberation, the
elite order of free france and resistance fighters . a small outhouse
(cabinet in french) means membership in de gaulle's personal office
staff, a mask means espionage work during world war ii . a motorcyclist
symbolizes trips to colombey to see the general, and a hand grenade
membership in the r.p.f . why the grenade symbol ? " because the
r.p.f . aimed to blow up the fourth republic . " an open door indicates
audiences with de gaulle, and an ear tags the man who has been summoned
to a consultation . an armchair designates a cabinet minister (a
slashed rosette signifies former government officials), a stool a
senator, a straight-backed chair a deputy, a bench a dignitary of the
fifth republic . two hobnailed boots signify membership in the gaullist
u.n.r., one hobnailed boot stands for the slightly leftist but gaullist
u.d.t., a rubber boot for other gaullist movements whose members were
forced to wade through the general's rhetoric . a mess kit marks the
men who took jobs under the fourth republic ( " i suppose they had to
eat, " said de gaulle) . a tank indicates participation in the army
revolt that overthrew the fourth republic in 1958, and a camel marks

congo under the knife suffering from amoebic dysentery,
fainting spells and an inflamed kidney, moise tshombe, 43, was being
treated last week in the clinique de passy in paris . at the same time,
his once potent and economically healthy domain of katanga was going
under the knife back in the congo . last year the congo central
government cut north katanga out of tshombe's former domain, leaving
him only the southern part . now the government subdivided the area
further, into the provinces of east katanga and lualaba (see map) . the
purpose of the gerrymander is to remove any power base to which tshombe
might return . premier cyrille adoula and other central-government
leaders in leopoldville have been terrified of a renewed secession
attempt in katanga once u.n . troops pull out of the congo . a personal
campaign against tshombe began last may when his bodyguard was forcibly
disbanded . next tshombe's correspondence was seized, with hints that
it gave proof of treasonable designs . the ailing tshombe took the hint
and left for europe, vowing : " i will come back, and i will not
abandon my post . " technically, moise tshombe is still eligible to run
for office in east katanga . but since much of tshombe's political
strength lies with the luanda tribe, now isolated in the new lualaba
province, his chances might be slim . though tshombe still has
considerable popularity in katanga, the europeans there want no more
adventures, and the flourishing union miniere asks only that it be
allowed to mine copper undisturbed and continue earning $260 million a
year for the congo more than twice the export revenue of the rest of
the country . the secessionist spirit seems to be dying . says one of
tshombe's old ministers : " we were puppets protecting european
interests, and now nobody wants to pull our strings . it's all over .
we have no choice but to accept the dictates of leopoldville .

japan from the cow-walk to the brawl ever since its founding 73
years ago, the japanese diet has had a hard time distinguishing between
robert's rules of order and those of the marquis of queensberry . just
as the typhoons come to japan in september, and the cherry blossoms in
april, the parliamentary brawling season arrives in june, filling the
diet with the sound of crashing fists and strangled curses . this year
the season arrived on schedule . more than secretaries . before world
war ii, brawling was a common practice among hot-blooded delegates who,
in the samurai tradition, were really hankering for medieval days when
political differences were settled with the sword . throughout the diet
building, the major conservative parties stationed flying squads of
young toughs, known ironically as ingaidan (lobbyists), always ready
for heckling or fighting . during the postwar years, the u.s . tried to
enforce good behavior, but the quiet spell ended with the lifting of
the occupation . though the ingaidan were gone, diet members hired
heavy-fisted brawlers as " secretaries . " a big riot in june 1954
injured some 50 persons, forced liberal premier shigeru yoshida to
cancel a long-planned trip to the u.s . and apologize to the emperor .
survivors of that fight recall the arrival of an opposition leader,
bukichi ( " big badger " ) miki, who vehemently objected to western
dress and always wore a kimono . he showed up for the fight dressed in
army fatigues and combat boots, explained to colleagues that " you
can't kick with a kimono on, you know . " since then, japan's emergent
socialists have introduced a whole new array of techniques, many more
or less nonviolent . the most popular is ushi aruki, or cow-walking .
realizing that they cannot block the overwhelming conservative
majority, the socialists do their best to slow business to a standstill
. in balloting sessions, each socialist member gets up slowly as his
name is called, shuffles toward the rostrum with the shortest steps
possible . where it takes 230 conservatives only 15 minutes to vote,
120 socialists consume as much as an hour and a half . cow-walking is
combined with sitdown strikes in diet corridors, deliberate traffic
jams, boycotts, and picketing to prevent the speaker from taking his
seat . through these tactics, the socialists force allnight sessions,
hoping that the wornout government men will have to give in somewhere
along the line . not enough bodies . this year, with a backlog of 66
bills still stalled in committee, premier ikeda ordered his men to push
them through before the diet session closes july 6 . when the
government party recently used its majority to force a vote on a
controversial relief-law revision, cow-walking was no longer enough .
fists and ashtrays started to fly . battling lawmakers shouted : "
respect parliamentary procedures ! " the brawling later spread to the
cabinet committee, where five bills were stalled . socialists massed
around the committeeroom door to prevent chairman tadanori nagayama
from entering . a flying wedge of burly conservative " secretaries "
smashed through, carrying the aging, anemia-weakened chairman in with
them . as the vote was hurriedly taken, socialists screamed " fascist
dictatorship ! " and charged . in the melee, chairman nagayama
disappeared, was rescued ten minutes later by diet guards who found him
bruised and bleeding on the floor . he was rushed to a hospital . " we
won't have enough bodies to go around if people get injured every time
a controversial bill comes up, " said yutaro takeyama, head of the
government party's strategy committee . " we will just have to appoint
stronger men to committee chairmanships, men who won't get put out of
action every time the going gets rough . /

laos evil spirits on the plain just a year after the geneva
agreement consolidated laos' three warring factions into a single
government, the precarious arrangement is falling apart . reason : the
communists are simply ignoring the truce, as well as their longtime
alliance with neutralist premier souvanna phouma, and are seeking to
wrest control of the vital plain of jars in central laos from
neutralist troops . though at first suspicious of the neutralist
regime, rightist general phoumi nosavan sent four battalions to help it
. despite such assistance, the neutralist forces under general kong le
have only one strategic position left on the plain phou theneng
mountain and its foothills . last week the communist pathet lao opened
a heavy artillery barrage on kong le's position . " at first, the
communists were very good to us and gave us supplies, " says the little
general . " but now i know the pathet lao are not fighting for laos but
for communism . we do not want laos to be controlled by anyone, not the
communists or the americans . " old battle scar . in his olive-drab
headquarters tent on the plain of jars, wearing a t shirt, a pair of
levi's and rubber bath shoes, kong le perches on a stool morosely
studying a map beneath the light of a swaying hurricane lamp . the
picture is discouraging : the pathet lao are advancing in the vang
vieng area, 13 neutralist soldiers are missing after an action at ban
boua, a 100-truck red supply convoy from north viet nam arrived at the
pathet lao headquarters at khang khay . at such news, kong le is apt to
wince, rub an old battle scar on his forehead and say : " my head
hurts . " then he usually takes some pills, and a bodyguard treats his
shoulder with vicks ointment . while the neutralists are increasingly "
neutral " against the reds, premier souvanna phouma continues to insist
on a defensive war, is reluctant to take the initiative . " what can i
do ? " muses kong le despondently . " the premier is always telling
me i must not attack . it is very difficult . " locked briefcases .
kong le is a magnet for some of the most idealistic men in laos . short
(5 ft . 1 in., 115 lbs.), quiet and good-natured, he neither drinks,
smokes nor gambles and is fanatic about health, honesty and cleanliness
. he shares common laotian superstitions, such as wearing a " magic "
ring and a wrist amulet to placate the phi (spirits, evil or otherwise)
. without personal ambition, kong le says that " when laos is free, "
he will go home to his village and become a farmer . in the field, he
shares his tent with three officers and four enlisted men . they mess
together around a campfire, sing sad laotian songs or dance the
graceful lamvong, while kong le, holding two pet hamsters in his lap,
looks on . his possessions are few : a desk, a footlocker, a
transistor radio (gift from the u.s . ambassador), and five locked
briefcases, which he keeps under his bunk . occasionally he unlocks one
to take out not confidential papers but a handkerchief and a pair of
socks, and then carefully relocks it . while admitting his leadership
qualities, western observers are often depressed by kong le's laotian
indifference to discipline and logistics . although supplies are
airlifted to the neutralists by five u.s.-loaned c-46s from vientiane,
trucks and jeeps break down for lack of parts . ammunition dumps are
left unguarded and open to weather . neutralist officers talk to each
other " in the clear " on field radios, leave marked maps lying around,
and drive at night with headlights blazing . the supply system is so
haphazard that often one unit overflows with rice rations but lacks
bullets, while another is loaded with munitions but starves . none of
the neutralist troops have been paid in almost a year . says kong le :
/ my men are tired, but their morale is high, and they still have the
will to fight . " long silence . they demonstrated that will, in a
laotian way, just two ridges beyond kong le's headquarters . over the
velvety landscape and through soft summer rain rolled two tanks and an
armored car crowded with neutralist soldiers . their objective was a
pathet lao artillery emplacement on top of a steep, conical hill . as
the tanks chugged up the first rise, a herd of wild ponies stampeded
away from them . one tank and the armored car soon halted, but the
second tank labored upward, followed by a skirmish line of scrambling
soldiers . moments later, the pathet lao gun flashed, and the tank
fired back . both missed . it soon became evident that the communist
gun could not be depressed sufficiently to get the tank in its sights .
even so, both sides fired futilely for two hours . then the tank
rumbled around a side of the hill, and the neutralist soldiers vanished
among the trees . a long silence followed . the pale sun shone through
showers, and a
rainbow briefly appeared over the purple
mountains . two of the wild ponies returned
and began grazing . the battle simply
blurred into the general drift of events in laos .

south viet nam the heart of quang duc heads bowed, palms pressed
together in prayer, thousands of buddhists filed quietly through
saigon's xa loi pagoda last week to witness what most of them believed
to be a miracle . amid the fragrance of incense-burning reeds,
yellowrobed priests chanted from sunrise to midnight, laymen gazed in
awe, and weeping women held children up to see it all . on the altar,
inside a crystal urn, which in turn was encased in a bouquetflanked
glass chest, lay the object of their reverence a charred piece of flesh
. under it a hand-lettered sign announced : " the eternal heat of high
priest quang duc . " two weeks earlier, to dramatize the buddhist
majority's fight for greater religious freedom under south viet nam's
roman catholic president ngo dinh diem, a 73-year-old buddhist monk
named thich quang duc had spectacularly set himself afire in a saigon
street . later the martyr's scorched remains were assigned to final
cremation in a rice field outside the capital . but, as the priests
told it, when the old man's ashes were removed from the oven, his heart
emerged miraculously undestroyed obviously the supernatural work of
buddha . immediately, his fellow monks proclaimed quang duc a saint .
skeptics suggested the quang duc's heart had been removed from the body
before cremation, or had been injected with a fire-resisting fluid .
certainly the phenomenon was far from original ; down through the
ages, in legend and fact, the hearts of heroic figures have more than
once withstood the flames. but the " miracle " serves the buddhists in
their two-month-old war with diem . thanks partly to pressure from the
u.s., which fears that massive buddhist disaffection could wreck south
viet nam's long, vital campaign against the communists, the diem
government signed a compromise agreeing to let the buddhists fly their
own flag and promising to ease anti-buddhist discrimination e regime
fails to show good faith, the buddhists vow, they will start new
demonstrations and they are counting on the symbol of quang duc's
durable heart to help keep the faithful inspired .
when gautama buddha's body was
cremated, tradition has it, some parts of it failed to burn . joan of
arc's heart is said to have survived her burning at the stake and been
thrown into the seine . when percy bysshe shelley drowned off italy in
1822, three literary friends lord byron, edward john trelawny and leigh
hunt cremated the corpse on a pyre of driftwood . the job almost done,
trelawny suddenly thrust in his arm and snatched out the heart, which,
although fiery hot, was strangely unconsumed . in oscar wilde's fairy
tale, the happy prince, the statue's broken heart fails to melt in the

communists the confrontation a troupe of patagonian jugglers
would have received a warmer welcome from the kremlin . not a single
soviet reporter or photographer was on hand when the men from peking
appeared at moscow airport ; pravda did not even mention their arrival.
 after months of invective, accusations and counteraccusations, the
great confrontation between soviet and chinese party delegations was
finally at hand . east and west watched the showdown or what could be
seen of it with equal fascination .  although nikita khrushchev suddenly
discovered urgent business in kiev, the kremlin was stiffly correct
about it all, sent out its chief dialectician, lanky, austere mikhail
suslov, to meet the visitors . head of peking's seven-man mission :
teng hsiao-ping, secretarygeneral of the chinese communist party . as
teng stepped out of a soviet tu-104 jet, a crowd of chinese residents
in moscow, watched closely by a chinese army colonel, sent up a cheer .
suslov smiled, stepped forward and shook teng's hand . but the russian
omitted the usual brief welcoming address, instead politely suggested
that teng might like a two-hour rest before getting down to business .
when a chinese delegate remarked on the chilly 57o temperature, a
muscovite red replied : " we hope it will get warmer . " fresh insults.
in one sense, things undoubtedly got warmer when both sides met
behind the massive walls of a rarely used mansion in the lenin hills
section of moscow . suslov and teng exchanged toasts, but that was just
routine . for under the pose of politeness, the sino-soviet quarrel was
becoming ruder than ever . without explanation, peking suddenly
withdrew its two entries from an international film festival about to
open in moscow . and just before the party leaders met, khrushchev and
mao tse-tung exchanged a fresh round of insults over red china's
25-point denunciation of soviet policy . although the soviets
themselves refused to publish it, moscow complained last week that
chinese agents handed out the document in cities from odessa to
leningrad and even in the atomic research center of dubna, near moscow.
chinese crews on the peking-moscow express scattered bundles of the
manifesto through coach windows, used the train's public-address system
to read the chinese charges to the captive soviet audience . after
moscow expelled three chinese diplomats for having a hand in this
extraordinary circulation campaign, peking ostentatiously welcomed them
home with bouquets of flowers . at the same time, the chinese condemned
the soviet move as a violation of its right, as a government, to
circulate statements abroad . nonsense, replied the soviets . what gave
the chinese the idea that they could " behave as though they were in
one of the provinces of china ? " such tactics, fumed the kremlin,
were plainly a violation of soviet sovereignty : " it is obvious that
instead of searching for ways to a rapprochement, the chinese
leadership aims at aggravating differences . " equally matched . if
that was peking's purpose, it could find no better man than teng .
short, stocky, in his 60s, teng was believed badly crippled in the
chinese civil war, still has a limp and a nervous tic when he speaks
which does not keep him from speaking often and abrasively . no
stranger to the russians, he attended two previous moscow meetings on
the split in 1957 and in 1960 . a veteran of mao's long march to yenan
in the 1930s, teng came to prominence as a political commissar in the
army, since 1952 has risen to a place among the top four or five men in
red china's hierarchy . in prestige and personality he is a match for
suslov, 60, who for years was stalin's ideological mouthpiece, and now
supplies khrushchev with the theoretical justifications for political
strategy . inevitably, western diplomats speculated whether the red
chinese and the soviets would sever party connections or diplomatic
relations, carry the feud to a summit session of world communist
leaders, or merely agree to continue to be disagreeable . whatever
happened, the gravest schism in the history of communism was at hand .

.W
what they
are fighting about
at its simplest,
the russian-chinese quarrel is over what strategy to follow toward the
ultimate victory of communism and over who shall be in charge of
operations . but beneath this there lies a far deeper split : the
split between communist theory and human reality . ever since karl marx
predicted that the revolution would break out in industrially advanced
western europe, while it actually came in backward, agricultural
russia, such contradictions have haunted communism . today, according
to marxist theory, capitalism should be in its death throes, the
working class in utter misery, and the former colonial peoples well on
the road to communism . instead, capitalism is thriving, western
workers are going middle-class, and the ex-colonies tend toward
socialism but hardly toward communism . nikita khrushchev favors
changing the theory to fit these facts more closely ; he is, as peking
accurately charges, a revisionist . mao tse-tung favors changing the
facts to fit the theory ; he is, as moscow says, a dogmatist . but
both are also realists, motivated by different national interests,
different economies, and different histories . khrushchev, the ruler of
a nation that has at last begun to gain some material rewards, argues
that people are not interested in war or revolution but in peaceful
prosperity, and that rocketrattling will only drive millions away from
communism . mao, ruler of a country with a lot less to lose, master of
a peasantry whose appetites demand a bowl of rice, not a tv set or a
car, replies in effect that he is not running a popularity contest with
the west . power cannot be won by wooing adherents but by fighting for
it otherwise communism will atrophy . from the golden horde to yenan
marxism pretends that it raises people above race and nation, but
moscow and peking are divided by racial hostility and memories of
conflict, which would persist even if ideological differences could be
ironed out . russia has never forgotten the golden horde of genghis
khan, which swept west from mongolia in the 13th century, conscripting
volga boatmen into the khan's army and forcing local princes to kowtow.
when, after 200 years, the mongol empire collapsed, the newly united
russians lost no time in getting even . " wehre is china ? " asked
czar mikhail romanov . " is it rich ? what can we lay claim to ? "
russian claims (manchuria, outer mongolia, sinkiang) caused friction
for centuries, down to the present . as late as 1949, when the chinese
reds had virtually conquered the mainland from the nationalists, moscow
was still dickering for territorial concessions . the chinese still
sneer at the russians as " big noses " and consider them as alien as
other westerners . moreover, the population pressure along the
sino-soviet border is a constant menace to moscow ; by 1980 there will
be 1 billion chinese . when a british visitor suggested to khrushchev
not long ago that the chinese masses would eventually explode north
into siberia or south to australia, nikita replied grimly : " i'm in
favor of australia . " from the start, russian national interests also
shaped moscow's attitude toward the chinese communists . in the 1920s,
stalin ruthlessly sacrificed mao's communist movement to chiang
kaishek, whom he supported because he considered him a strong soviet
ally who would fight both western and japanese threats to russian power.
decimated by chiang, the ragged chinese communists survived in the
caves of yenan and eventually went on to conquer china, despite
stalin's warning that they were backward and not ready for revolution .
after the war, stalin sent mao a russian handbook of partisan strategy
against the nazis ; mao passed it to an aide who snorted : " if we
had this as our textbook we would have been annihilated ten years ago .
thus mao was beholden
no one, least of all stalin, for his victory . yet ironically, the
first open ideological crack in the moscow-peking partnership came over
khrushchev's 1956 denunciation of stalin . from " secret speech " to
sputnik mao had sent a message to the 20th party congress lavishly
praising the dead dictator . without bothering to consult the chinese,
khrushchev delivered his famed " secret speech " to the congress, in
which he suddenly unmasked stalin as a megalomanical tyrant . peking
was stunned . mao felt correctly, as was proved a few months later by
the uprisings in poland and hungary that the destalinization drive
would touch off a wave of unrest . even though stalin had bullied and
betrayed the chinese communists (as well as helped them, at a price,
during the korean war), mao believed in stalin's principle of
centralized rule, preferred a stable red empire to one in ferment . the
chinese communist party central committee hastily called a secret
session ; a month later, red china defiantly announced that, despite
what the kremlin had to say, stalin's achievements outweighed his
errors . on foreign policy peking agreed for the moment to back
khrushchev's talk of peaceful coexistence with the west, since mao
himself was then energetically pushing the " bandung spirit " of sweet
neighborliness in asia . even this qualified support for the kremlin
disappeared when, in august 1957, the soviet union test-fired its first
icbm and two months later launched sputnik . russian rocketry, peking
decided, for the first time in history gave the communist camp military
superiority over the west ; the reds must now seize the advantage by
fomenting revolutions in underdeveloped nations, even at the risk of
war . instead, khrushchev pursued a detente with the west . in 1958 he
agreed to a moratorium on nuclear testing in the atmosphere (broken in
1961), partly designed to freeze out peking as an atomic power . when
the chinese wanted russian atomic cover for a move against the offshore
islands and formosa, moscow refused . from great leap to great brawl
meanwhile, the russians did not seem eager to help their chinese
brothers with their growing internal economic difficulties . while
khrushchev wooed neutralist india and egypt with aid, and even brought
his moneybags on a pilgrimage to that renegade red, tito, not an
additional ruble was allotted to mao . the red chinese used the only
surplus raw material at their command : people . millions of peasants
were herded into people's communes and hitched to plows . peking broke
up families, tried to ban money, jerry-built hundreds of " backyard "
steel furnaces . the slogan was : " communism can grow grain and make
steel . " through brawn and " revolutionary romanticism " china was to
turn almost overnight into an industrialized land . the great leap
forward was hailed as a short cut to communism and a slap at moscow .
khrushchev warned that it could not be done . after a few months the
experiment indeed collapsed . gloating over the failure, khrushchev
told visiting hubert humphrey that mao's idea had been foolishly "
utopian . " by the time nikita showed up in peking in 1959, fresh from
his tour of the u.s . and the meeting with ike at camp david, he was
barely on speaking terms with his hosts . the airport was decorated
with huge posters of stalin ; on the way to town, khrushchev and mao
began an argument that lasted for the next four days . when the soviet
ruler left, not even the niceties of a formal communique were observed.
by early 1960 mao had clearly
given up hope of persuading khrushchev to change his flexible cold war
policy, and began an all-out chinese offensive designed to topple
khrushchev from power . it was also the start of an endless argument
about whether authority for moscow's " peaceful coexistence " or
peking's " inevitability of war " could be found in the sacred lenin
texts . actually lenin, and even stalin, had argued both ways at
various times, depending on conditions and moscow pointed out that
conditions were certainly different in the nuclear age . when mao's men
carried the attack into a meeting of world communist leaders in
bucharest in june, khrushchev was incensed . " one cannot mechanically
repeat what lenin said decades ago, " he shouted . " we live in a time
when neither marx nor engels nor lenin is with us . if we act like
children who study the alphabet by building words out of letters, we
shall not get very far . " a full-dress summit session of 81 communist
parties in moscow in november 1960 produced a statement (adopted
unanimously, of course) that merely lumped together these diametrically
opposed opinions . then last fall, the red chinese invasion of india
only served to justify khrushchev's view that mao was a reckless
fanatic, and moscow ostentatiously failed to back peking . as for
khrushchev's withdrawal of soviet missiles from cuba, the maneuver
confirmed mao's worst fears about vacillating kremlin leadership,
leaning first to " adventurism, " then to " capitulationism . "
thundered peking : " it is 100 per cent appeasement . a munich pure
and simple . imperialism is only a paper tiger . " to which khrushchev
replied : " the paper tiger has nuclear teeth . only a madman would
speak of a new world war . " and that is essentially where the argument
still stands . from vision to danger time was when western skeptics
wondered whether the sino-soviet split was real . khrushchev, they
figured, might be relatively nice to the west only long enough to
wangle some concessions on nato or nuclear arms control ; then mao
would step in and together they would demolish the free world . today
it is inconceivable that the quarrel is merely an act . in fact, there
is a growing vision shared by such disparate prophets as arnold toynbee
and charles de gaulle of russia and the west some day standing together
as allies against china . stranger things have happened in history .
yet the vision has its dangers . the west has almost imperceptibly
moved into a new era of softness toward communism . few any longer talk
of defeating communism ; coexistence is more or less accepted in the
west . this may be only realistic in the nuclear age . but all over the
west there is a creeping notion that khrushchev's kind of communism can
be lived with that only peking's is really bad and this has taken much
steam out of the anti-communist position . nikita's " reasonable "
approach has helped the italian reds gain strength, has revived dreams
of a new popular front among once solidly anti-communist french
socialists, has even prompted belgian foreign minister paul henri spaak
to say that the removal of u.s . nuclear stockpiles from western europe
might not be such a bad idea after all . these are only modest red
gains . but khrushchev can point to them to argue plausibly that he is
not nearly so bad a communist strategist as peking makes him out to be

western europe the unvisit arriving in bonn just 13 days after
president kennedy's triumphant visit, charles de gaulle made no effort
to enter a popularity contest . both french and germans legitimately
emphasized that the two-day trip was only a " working visit " as
stipulated by the brand-new franco-german friendship treaty . as far as
protocol and the public were concerned, it was even a kind of unvisit
no parades, no crowds . the bonn press predicted that de gaulle would
try to whip the germans into line in case they had got too friendly
toward the u.s . he was not as crude as that . but he had been stung by
kennedy's frankfurt speech about atlantic unity (although dismissing it
as " salade, salade, salade " ), and de gaulle obviously wanted to find
out in bonn if the germans had been sufficiently impressed by it to
move away from the franco-german alliance . answer : the germans were
just about standing still . they chided de gaulle and his top ministers
for the announced withdrawal of french naval units from the nato fleet
but did not press him on the question of britain's eventual admission
to the common market . there was some haggling on agriculture ;
because of a price-depressing agricultural surplus, which caused farm
riots in southern france last week, the french had just closed their
borders to imports of tomatoes and apricots, without notifying the
common market . the only really substantive agreement : a massive
youth exchange program . among other things, de gaulle wanted to get to
know vice chancellor ludwig erhard, the man who will take over from
konrad adenauer next fall . they had an hour's " friendly /
actually, they talked past each other . de gaulle kept stressing the
mystique of europe, while erhard tried to talk economics but found that
the general was as little interested in such matters as the chancellor.
as for the franco-german treaty, de gaulle managed to sound both
hopeful and casual . " treaties, " he said with a shrug, " are like

world law " for civilized existence " someone once asked solon
how justice could be achieved in athens . " it can be achieved, "

who are personally hurt . " this generalized passion for justice has
always been a hard standard to live up to, but u.s . chief justice earl

world-lawman charles sylvanus rhyne, past president of the american bar
association, and followed a series of preparatory sessions in costa
rica,
japan, nigeria and italy . said rhyne in his keynote
address : " we share one great ideal which transcends our diversity a
belief that in the rule of law lies the route to world peace . " world
law, rhyne cautioned, should not be thought of as " a dramatic panacea
or cure-all for the world's ills, but rather a patient labor demanding
immense and constant effort to develop the true basis for civilized
progress and existence . " suggested improvements . henry r . luce,
editor in chief of time inc., recalled the biblical passage, " blessed
are the peacemakers " and pointed out :
peace has to be made . peace cannot merely be kept not for
long by force of arms . neither will peace be given to us as an
undeserved gift from heaven . overwhelmingly, peace is the work of
justice, and the work of justice is mainly the work of the law . " luce
urged his listeners to carry the case for world law " to all
politicians and to all the governments of the world . " said he : " so
far as i know, no president or prime minister has put the rule of law
at the top of his political banner, " but the " rule of law can become
good politics . " in six days of deliberations, the jurists modestly
began " the work of the law " by surveying the world's existing legal
framework and making suggestions for improvement . main conclusions : .the
united nations . really to be " mankind's best hope for a peaceful
world, " it needs more muscle . u.n . peace-keeping efforts should be
codified, a permanent " peace police force " created, and the security
council enlarged . the conference recommended partial abolition of the
veto : henceforth it should not be permitted when a dispute can be
settled peacefully . but there was plainly no desire to get involved in
the touchy issue of u.n . financing . .the world court . with most
states (the u.s . included) reserving the right to ignore its
jurisdiction, it has rendered only 13 final verdicts in its 18 years .
more nations should bow to it, suggested the athens meeting . the court
should be empowered to hear cases between individuals as well as states
; and the possibility of " regional world courts " should be explored.
 .foreign investment & trade . both should be protected by a framework
of more efficient law . statutes on foreign investment should be
codified, and special courts considered for settling disputes .
national committees of lawyers should be set up to study the legal
machinery for trade, and improved policing of international patents . .
space . the newest frontier provoked more questions than
recommendations . where does airspace (over which nations exert
sovereignty) end, and outer space (which no country has yet claimed)
begin ? are the moon and planets open domain like columbus' new
world, where the hoisting of flag and cross was sufficient to establish
sovereignty ? on the latter, the conference said no that the u.n .
should be granted sovereignty over all objects of outer space, no
matter which nation's spaceships land on them first . delegates further
suggested adoption of " the principle of liability for injury from
space accidents, " urged an international conference to forge a body of
space law . salvation proclamation . at week's end, these similar
topics were adopted as a " global work program . " the jurists also 1)
agreed to found a world peace through law center, to be organized by
rhyne, which will serve as a research clearinghouse for all the world's
legal systems, 2) set in motion plans for a world rule of law year, 3)
drew up a " proclamation of athens, " stating their case before world
opinion . " this conference, " said the proclamation, " being deeply
concerned with the fact that violation of the rule of law in
international affairs can only lead to destruction of mankind through
nuclear holocaust, hereby proclaims that law must replace force as the
controlling factor in the fate of humanity . " one measure of the
difficulty of that task : although invitations went to all communist
countries, none (with the exception of yugoslavia) sent delegations to
athens .

great britain and then there were three harold macmillan
valiantly tried to divert britain's mind from sex and security .
displaying something like his old form in the house of commons, he
delivered an eloquent speech on prospects for disarmament and a summit
conference that was received respectfully even by the opposition . but
macmillan's eloquence could not diminish tory distress over the three
separate scandals that plagued his government . first, of course, was
the continuation of the profumo case . in marylebone magistrates'
court, osteopath stephen ward, mentor of christine keeler and friend of
disgraced war secretary john profumo, was ordered to stand trial on
seven charges of procuring, arranging abortions, and living off the
earnings of prostitution . by the close of the three-day hearing,
magistrate leo gradwell had permitted numerous witnesses to testify
without revealing their identity, even allowed one witness to leave the
court shrouded in a topcoat . next, there was the case of italian
nuclear physicist giuseppe enrico martelli, who denied at the old
bailey last week that he had prepared to spy for the russians, said
that on the contrary, for seven years he had resisted russian pressure
to become a red agent . but the crown contended that martelli was
caught with shoes that had hollowed-out secret compartments in the
heels and that his cigarette packages contained wafer-thin pads with
secret codes and passwords . finally, there was the case of harold
adrian russell philby, journalist, ex-foreign office official, and boon
companion of communist spies guy burgess and donald maclean, whose
reappearance in the news recalled the most notorious of britain's
sex-and-spy scandals . out of sight . " kim " philby had known burgess
since undergraduate days at cambridge, welcomed him as a boarder in his
house when both were stationed at the british embassy in washington in
1950 . when burgess and maclean eloped to russia in 1951, philby was
forced to resign from the foreign office amidst a flurry of rumors that
he was " the third man " who had tipped them off that the police were
on their trail . later, this charge was indignantly denied by harold
macmillan, then foreign secretary, who personally vouched for philby's
good character . the foreign office even asked the observer to hire
philby as a correspondent because " it seemed unfair that so able a man
should be finding difficulty in earning a living now that he had
clearance from the foreign secretary . " the publication took the hint
and, along with the economist, sent philby to the middle east, where
his father, st . john philby, the famed arab scholar, had spent years
exploring the desert . but last january, beset with financial and
alcohol problems, philby suddenly disappeared from his beirut home and
dropped out of sight . last week, in the commons, lord privy seal
edward heath revealed that philby had surfaced " in one of the
countries of the soviet bloc . " new information had come to light,
said heath, that revealed that philby had been a soviet agent while
working for the government and in fact had been the tipster who had
warned burgess and maclean . to the house, macmillan praised britain's
security services for coming up with the new information overlooking
the fact that they had cottoned to it twelve years too late . case of
jitters . in moscow, guy burgess was amused by the revelations in
parliament . " mark you, my dear boy, " he told a reporter, " the
longer i stay in the soviet union and read about the scandals in
england, the more glad i am to be here, the more i believe that any
civilized person like philby might easily want to come here . " but
burgess denied that philby or anyone else had warned him and maclean
that they were under suspicion . in fact, declared burgess, maclean
only learned that he was being tailed when a london taxi he was riding
in one day was rammed in a traffic accident by a carful of british
secret service agents . summing up " this latest schemozzle " involving
the british government, burgess remarked : " someone once said, "
there is nothing so squalid as a patrician in a panic.' the head of
british security is usually a patrician, and panic seems to be
universal . " back home, the tories might not be panicked, but they
were showing a bad case of the jitters . in two by-elections,
conservative candidates finished dismally behind labor .

in 1845, before the potato famine decimated its
population, ireland was western europe's most densely settled country
; since then, its 9,000,000 inhabitants have dwindled to 2,824,000 .
ireland is the only nation in europe whose population has shrunk in
that time . while irishmen left the country in waves, they entered it
in a trickle, for ireland has the lowest marriage rate, and one of the
lowest birth rates, in all europe . to the neo-malthusian, the irish
would seem models of ecological balance . in a country where food
production is barely increasing, 66 per cent of all irish males between
20 and 39 are bachelors, and vast numbers of men and women die single .
/ holy ireland . " the exodus from ireland, which novelist george moore
ironically justified by calling ireland " a fatal disease " from which
/ it is the plain duty of every irishman to dissociate himself, "
continued after the country won its independence from britain in 1921 .
as in most other newly liberated countries, the men who took over were
romantic revolutionary heroes, steeped in the otherworld but ill
prepared by experience to meet the practical challenges of building a
modern nation . " when drake was winning seas for england, " in poet
patrick kavanagh's rueful lines, ailed in puddles of the past . " for
the most part, ireland's postliberation politicians and intellectuals
seemed determined to ignore the seas for the puddles . for years they
kept up the strident outcry over partition and winked at endless,
squalid raids on the ulster border . ireland, after all, was a divided
country for decades before such latecomers to partition as germany,
korea and viet nam . in many refreshing ways, the land has remained
true to its leaders' vision of a pastoral " holy ireland . " the irish
spend only one-fifth as much yearly ($8,000,000) for defense as new
yorkers pay each year for garbage collection . they do not support a
single superhighway, nightclub, parking meter, strip joint or subway .
the suicide rate is europe's lowest . crimes of any kind are few and
getting fewer although the authorities admit that the nation's
commonest transgression, larceny of pedal cycles, bears watching .
porther & shamrock . in economic terms, ireland's insular ideal proved
disastrous . true to the aims of the sinn fein (ourselves alone)
movement, the government in the '30s discouraged foreign investment in
ireland, raised some of the world's highest tariff barriers to exclude
british goods and protect new, highly inefficient domestic industry .
the result of its belt tightening was a rising tide of emigrants that
by 1956 reached 600,000, highest since the 1890s . among those who
stayed on, there was a paralyzing sense of frustration and fatalism .
life was not only hard it was dull . to many irishmen, the perverse,
pervasive mediocrity of their culture was typified by gaelic-worship .
the dying gaelic tongue had become the badge of irish nationalism
during the revolution though few of its leaders could speak it . even
before 1949, when the republic of eire was established, the government
had made gaelic language study compulsory in the schools, even
encouraged students to take other subjects entirely in gaelic .

after the long emotional excitement of the fight
for independence, ireland in the postwar years seemed to be
hibernating, caught in a descending spiral of cynicism and feckless
nostalgia . its malaise was expressed by playwright sean o'casey : "
someone or something is ruining us . what do we send out to the world
now but woeful things young lads and lassies, porther, greyhounds,
sweep tickets, and the shamrock green ? we've scatthered ourselves
over the wide world, and left our own sweet land thin . we're just
standing on our knees now . " bloody baluba . today the irish are
beginning to stand on their feet . in business and government,
universities and pubs, there is a new sense of purpose and push, a
mounting awareness that ireland has finally begun to make its way in
the world . after four decades of broody isolation, and seemingly
pro-german neutrality in world war ii (although in their contrary way,
many irish volunteered for the british army), a newly outward-looking
ireland has acquired international influence out of all proportion to
its size or political power . in the united nations, the nonaligned
irish led by ambassador frederick boland, who was president of the
general assembly in the time of khrushchev's shoe-banging tantrum are
universally respected . in the congo, where 5,000 irish troops have
served and 26 died with the u.n . peacekeeping mission, their probity
and discipline command the admiration of africans and belgians alike .
the experience has added a new term of abuse to the irishman's copious
vocabulary of invective : " you bloody baluba ! "  the u.n . irish
have taught many a native to dance a jig . says a captain from cork :
/ only the irish and other heathens can appreciate our dahling pipes .
/ two-way bridge . as the man who has done most to end his country's
long sleep, sean lemass got his chance when he took over as taoiseach
in 1959 . de valera, near-blind and doggedly indifferent to the
country's worsening economic plight, was persuaded by his own fianna
fail party to step aside for lemass and run for the presidency . his
successor, after 19 years as minister of commerce and industry, was
passionately convinced that ireland's timorous protectionism could only
lead to national extinction . as fianna fail's new leader, lemass was
the antithesis of all the old fire-breathing heroes, talked trade and
tariffs to the voters in intense, rapid-fire sentences that many found
hard to follow . " that lemass ! " snorted one dubious dublin
politician . " he couldn't lead ireland over o'connell bridge . " what
sean lemass wanted most was to lure foreign investors over o'connell
bridge . the new prime minister sent blarney-blessed salesmen around
the world persuading foreign industries to set up plants in ireland .
they offered one of the few labor surpluses in all europe, liberal
grants for equipment and construction, and additional cash to companies
that would build plants and train workers in ireland's pinched
northwest and south .
a tribe in north katanga that ambushed an irish contingent
in !960, killing ten of its soldiers .
many irishmen were profanely skeptical, but the
program so far has proved a gallivanting success . ireland today is in
the throes of a belated industrial revolution that is boosting living
standards, diversifying its farm-based economy, and will increasingly
absorb the talents that the nation breeds . since 1955, 160 new irish
and foreign-backed plants have created 21,000 new jobs and are turning
out goods ranging from transistor radios (japanese) and pianos (dutch)
to heavy cranes for a german company and oil heaters for a french firm
. fifty more plants are nearing completion, most notably a french-owned
aviation factory to turn out a new, short-haul plane aimed specifically
at u.s . feeder airlines . the shiny new plants in shannon, cork,
limerick, dublin and killarney ( " just like the black forest, " says a
west german industrialist who has built a factory there) have worked no
economic miracle in ireland to compare with europe's boom . but
industrial production has risen 20 per cent in three years . and its
success is stanching the population outflow : from an average of
43,000 a year, the number of emigrants dropped by more than 50 per cent
last year, is expected to total only 14,000 in 1963 . many emigrants
are now returning to take jobs back home . four rs . today's expansion
would not have been possible if sean lemass had not started laying the
groundwork long ago . lemass is the great-grandson of a hatter who
landed in dublin in 1820 . a young-appearing 63, he is by age, if not
by political style, a member of the generation that freed ireland and
has ruled it ever since . at school, he learned his four rs in the
dublin of 50 years ago, revolution was part of the curriculum and by
the age of 14 had joined the republican na fianna eireann, a sort of
boy scout underground . two years later, when the irish republican army
occupied the dublin post office at the start of the botched 1916 easter
week rising, sean was the youngest rebel of them all, spent four days
on the roof with a rifle, waiting for the british to mount an
old-fashioned infantry charge . he says wryly : " i'm afraid we had
rather naive ideas about modern warfare . " when british shells ended
the fiasco, 15 irish leaders were shot . young lemass was taken
prisoner and released within a month, presumably because of his age .
according to cherished, if apocryphal dublin legend, " the cops gave
a kick in the arse and told him to go home to his mom . " poor risk .
but in the turbulent years when the irish rebels fought against
britain's black and tans, sean lemass grew into a rugged guerrilla
fighter in the i.r.a.'s dublin brigade . he was jailed by the english
four times, escaped once . after the 1921 treaty, by which britain
created the self-governing irish free state but retained jurisdiction
over the six protestant counties of ulster, civil war flared between "
pro-treaty " irishmen and de valera's followers, who cried that ireland
could not accept partition . lemass, an officer on de valera's staff,
was captured by the other side and imprisoned for a year . in jail he
continued his war-shattered education with a cram course in economics,
politics and irish revolutionary writings . though he never returned to
prison after his release in 1923, four-time loser lemass was plainly a
poor matrimonial risk . when he started courting pretty, vivacious
kathleen hughes, he had the added disadvantages of having to placate
her father, a dublin carpenter and an anglophile . he warned his
daughter : " that boy is always on the run ; he'll never be able to
make a home for you . " kathleen decided to risk it anyway . they were
married in 1924, have a son noel, who is a member of parliament, and
three daughters (the eldest, maureen, is married to charles haughey,
the shrewd, hard-knuckled minister of justice, who is tipped as a
potential prime minister) .
lemass' bold program of industrialization has
already created new jobs and wealth in an economy whose primary
product, beef for britain, has been the same for as long as there have
been potatoes to go with it . as new opportunity at home lowers the
perilously high emigration rate, the government is finally beginning to
rebut the bitter quip that ireland is " a home for men rather than a
breeding ground for emigrants and bullocks . " the country's rapturous
huzzas for john kennedy were more than an expression of pride in a gael
made good to many young irishmen, he seems more real than the irish
martyrs whose streaked statues fill dublin's parks with silent
declamation . jack's homecoming epitomized to the irish the successful
distance they themselves have traveled . spanglish & spells . however
far they may go, the irish retain a deep sense of their past and the
myths and memories that crowd their wild, lonely land . " the gods
whistle in the air, " wrote sean o'faolain . " the otherworld is always
at one's shoulder . " the otherworld and the real past are inseparably
bound together in the irish imagination and in the runic place names,
from the pagan landmark called two breasts of dana to ancient
waterford, where in 1170 strongbow, the norman earl of pembroke,
clamped 7f centuries of english rule on ireland . what the mists of
legend cannot obscure is that for ages of religious persecution and
economic exploitation, through countless risings and reprisals, the
irish slaved, starved and battled for their land as stubbornly as if
ireland itself were the isle of the blest . the remote little island in
the atlantic has cast its shadow across the civilized world since the
dark ages, when irish priests and scholars roamed europe expounding new
(and mostly heretical) theologies . in a diaspora even greater than the
expulsion of the jews, more than 3,000,000 irishmen in the past 100
years have scattered across the world, forming what an irish writer
calls " one of the world's great secret societies, with branches
everywhere " though the society was never very secret . everyone has
his own list of great irishmen, but there is no denying that the gifts
of the irish have always enriched other countries more than their own .
their talent for politics, for faith, above all for words, gave more
brilliant politicians, distinguished churchmen and magical writers to
the u.s . and the rest of the world than to ireland . perhaps only
their talent for fighting, while amply exported, as amply remained at
home . though in foreign lands, they invincibly stayed themselves ;
they also showed an uncanny ability to adapt to other cultures, whether
in latin america, where they concocted a lilting lingua franca known as
spanglish, or down under, where they developed a spectacular sport
known as australian rules, a blend of gaelic football and rugby .
though there was hardly a country or a field of endeavor where irishmen
failed to make a mark or a mint, the diminishing number of their
compatriots at home kept wondering fretfully if they were a vanishing
race .
heat with peat . when sinn fein broke apart, young lemass
was the chief architect of de valera's new fianna fail (heroes of
destiny) party, which came to power in 1932 and has been in office
almost continually ever since . at 32, lemass was the youngest member
of de valera's cabinet and earned the affectionate biblical sobriquet "
benjamin " (after jacob's youngest son) . though dev had taught
mathematics and is fervently believed by many fond compatriots to be
one of the 13 men on earth who comprehend the theory of relativity the
taoiseach had neither head nor heart for economics, and left benjamin
to run his ministry as he saw fit . lemass faced monumental problems,
for during the '30s the government was locked in a vindictive, futile
economic war with the english, though it remained economically
dependent on britain . he strove desperately to mobilize enough new
industry to supply the nation's basic needs, though at high cost ; he
also founded the state transport network and organized a national
merchant marine in time to keep ireland fed during world war ii, in
which he took on the additional job of minister of supply, and by
brilliant improvisation averted crippling shortages . until recently,
it was axiomatic that " nobody but a fool would invest " in ireland .
lemass did not hesitate to use public funds wherever private capital
was not forthcoming for key projects . he took over a one-horse power
company and built it into a nationwide network that has electrified 76
per cent of all irish farms . the country had no oil and little coal,
but lemass found an inexhaustible source of industrial fuel in its peat
bogs, where huge machines now cut turf that a busy, state-owned
processing plant turns into inexpensive, slowburning briquettes . after
a long political wrangle, he got ireland's state-owned airline off the
ground, and has watched happily as aer lingus' shamrock-painted planes
have made it one of the few government airlines to turn a consistent
profit on the atlantic run . the very word socialism terrifies fianna
fail supporters, who are not only overwhelmingly catholic but include
many small landowners . yet one-third of all industrial enterprises in
ireland today are bankrolled by the government, which has gone farther
toward nationalization than even britain's socialists advocate . lemass
says he shares the attitude toward socialism that was expressed in the
late pope john's encyclical, pacem in terris : that no political
system is undesirable if it benefits the people . trim sails . in 1957,
after their children had grown up, sean and kathleen lemass moved from
their big old house in dublin to an unpretentious sevenroom bungalow in
a pleasant suburb south of the capital, where the prime minister is
picked up by a government car at 9 : 45 a.m . each day . he seldom
returns until after dinner . some years ago, lemass cut down on golf
and cards to the relief of old poker cronies who usually wound up
losers when lemass played to devote more time to the job . sturdy (5 ft
. 10 in.) and carefully groomed, he holds among his few foibles an
aversion to the byronic manes affected by many irishmen, and he does
not hesitate to bark at friends, underlings or his son when they need
haircuts .
some politicians criticize lemass for
being too much of a pragmatist . " he's a bit of a fly-boy, " said
labor party leader james larkin . " he trims his sails to different
winds . " the greatest challenge that lemass has to face as a
politician is to revitalize drab, unimaginative fianna fail, many of
whose front-bench heroes of destiny have been around since dev first
came to office . seven of the 13 members of the lemass cabinet are 60
or under, which is a relatively green age in irish politics but hardly
green enough . though he has little of the personal magnetism of old
spellbinder dev, the quiet man's drive to get ireland into the world's
markets and forums has attracted some of the bright, restive young
irishmen who are showing a revival of interest in politics . total
effort . lemass' most bruising disappointment in office was charles de
gaulle's rejection of british membership in the common market last year
. determined to take ireland into europe alongside britain, lemass had
already started whittling tariff barriers to give ireland's older and
most cosseted industries a whiff of the cold competitive wind outside .
to clear the way for ireland's entry, which he now believes cannot come
before 1970, lemass has unequivocally committed his nation, which has
9,000 men under arms, to support of nato policies . in 1949, at nato's
founding,the government declined membership with the legalistic
argument that to join an alliance with britain would be tantamount to
recognition of ulster, whose existence the republic has never accepted
. to lemass, by contrast, one of the most compelling motives for seeing
britain and ireland inside the european community is the very prospect
that ireland would thereby take a step closer to reunification .
automatic dismantling of their mutual tariff barriers under common
market rules, says lemass, would finally necessitate a degree of
cooperation between protestant and catholic ireland . instead of the
present prolonged farce of nonrecognition neither country will even
permit extradition of criminals by the other and continued stagnation
of ulster's economy, lemass foresees " a total national effort in which
old differences and animosities can be forgotten . " all the details .
the government's eagerness to raise ireland's " green curtain, " as
lemass calls it, reflects a growing cosmopolitanism in the universities
and population centers . the irish have made executives and technicians
from more than a dozen countries resoundingly welcome . they cheered
mightily for schoolgirl harumi suzuki, eight-year-old daughter of a
japanese plant manager at shannon, when she carried off first and third
prizes for irish poetry and gaelic recitation . young ireland's
horizons are being broadened by the foreign students who have been
flocking to irish universities, where they comprise nearly 17 per cent
of total enrollment ; most come from afro-asian countries, where the
distinctive accent of ex-colonial, nonaligned dublin has become
something of a status symbol . the visiting students, in turn, have
generated new interest in language and history courses among their
irish friends . the ultraconservative roman catholic clergy still
heavily censors the arts and entertainment . at one time or another,
many of the best native authors have been banned from libraries,
including works by george moore, liam o'flaherty, o'casey, frank
o'connor, shaw, brendan behan . but things are easing up a little .
cinematic sex has become so much sexier and more frequent, explains
justice minister haughey, that the censors have been told to go easy
with the scissors, " or else our cinemas won't get any films at all . "
another sign of the new liberality is a scheduled visit by the bolshoi
ballet to dublin this month, for irish mistrust of the intriguous
russians is so keen that they have yet to recognize the 45-year-old
soviet government .
television, which now lights up more than 200,000
screens, is a perennial assault on gaelic puritanism . ireland's own
station competes with programs beamed from britain that seem incredibly
risque to irish viewers ; the bbc's uninhibited coverage of christine
keeler's exploits has even jogged the stodgy, self-censoring irish
press into giving readers all the details . many irishmen, increasingly
resentful of censorship, have taken to sampling censored books, films
or plays by taking the 90-minute flight to london where far more
horrendous temptations abound . rebels & monarchs . the irish have
written some of the tenderest love lyrics in english literature, but in
their actual contact with the opposite sex, irishmen sometimes resemble
colombia's kogi indians, who, despising women, spend all their time
discussing philosophy with other males and chewing cocoa leaves to cool
off the sexual urges . an acid axiom among irish girls runs : " put an
irish feller in a room with a girl and two bottles of stout, and he'll
pick the stout any time . " many explanations have been offered for his
seeming misogyny : the epic suspicion that war and the gods are more
important than mere love ; the relentless emotional dominance of irish
mothers over irish sons ; the oddly puritanical streak in irish
catholicism ; above all, the heritage of hardship that gives the irish
a mortal terror of insecurity and encourages them to stay celibate . at
least some of these factors are changing, and the relations between the
sexes seem less self-conscious and at times downright friendly . the
irish now wed younger ; the average marriage age dropped from nearly
35 for men in 1929 to just over 30, from 29 for women to just under 27
. for the young, one of the most joyous innovations in recent years has
been a proliferation of dance halls, which have reached scores of small
communities, and a burgeoning of bands " 200 in all that keep the ould
sod jumping with hippetyhoppety jazz and carry such intriguing names as
rebels, jets, monarchs . unlike the old days, when the local priest
would often disperse a country ceilidh at sundown, dance-hall hours are
regulated by magistrates, who tend to be more liberal . and, as always,
the western world has its playboys . in london, where one in eight
births is illegitimate, authorities report that a disproportionate
number of unwed pegeens come over to have their babies free on
britain's national health service .
the most conspicuous vice of the irish in times
past has been " the drink . " today, though the pubs keep longer hours
and most irishmen can afford to drink more, public drunkenness is no
longer the common spectacle it used to be, and barefoot boys no longer
trot through city streets bearing jugs of foaming sout or bottles of
brandy home to dad . the younger generation seems to be more sober than
its parents . also, alcoholic habits are changing : more drinking is
done at home nowadays ; cocktails and hard liquor are cutting into
beer consumption ; and many pubs, which had long been jealously
guarded male preserves, have opened " singing lounges " where an
irishman can take his wife or girl . the image of the boozy,
belligerent irishman condemned as sheer hostile propaganda by sean
lemass dies hard, nonetheless . indeed, drunk or sober, few people on
earth can raise a glass with greater gusto or style . radiant goals .
ireland faces many more urgent problems . the country is still
critically short of modern housing ; hundreds of once elegant georgian
mansions in dublin have for years held some of europe's most squalid
slums . while the government has succeeded in easing ireland's
historically harsh system of farm leasing, nearly 1,000,000 of the
country's 11 million acres of agricultural land are still covered by
eleven-month leases, which discourage tenants and owners alike from
improving the land (after twelve months on a farm, an irish tenant has
a legal claim to buy it) . though 45 acres of good land are the
accepted minimum for a viable farm, there are still 208,000 farms (of
360,000) with less than 30 acres each . in the poor western counties,
one in three farms is still less than 15 acres, and sons grow old
waiting for fathers to die . though sean lemass is often chided in
parliament for foot-dragging on housing and farm reform, most of the
nation's problems are a longtime legacy of national poverty and
political timidity . what is radiantly different about ireland today is
the serious expectation that its ills and lags will in fact be
corrected . lemass will soon release details of a new six-year economic
program that aims to boost the g.n.p . 50 per cent by 1970 . if it
succeeds and his goals in the past have been set far short of actual
performance the nation will have traveled a long way from " the
unfortunate country " of ireland's ancient lament . the varied and
lively virtues of the irish, which in the past have often shaded into
weaknesses when they were not vigorously applied to a cause, are the
nation's best assurance that it can find the future it seeks for itself
. however bright the goal, ireland will still be many lightyears away
from the blest isle . but who knows ? they may have their troubles
there too .

cold war to moscow, with caution the pattern of arrival and
departure might be symbolic . by week's end everyone in moscow believed
that the red chinese delegation was ready to head home before too long
. at the same time, u.s . and british delegations were due to arrive .
the russians were jamming radio peking but let the voice of america
come in loud and clear . faced with the open chinese challenge to
soviet leadership of world communism, nikita khrushchev may want to
ease tensions with the west, both to bulwark his position at home and
to demonstrate the genuineness of his much-heralded coexistence policy
abroad . but whether khrushchev wants it badly enough to make some
really meaningful concessions is still another question . the issues .
as he flew off to moscow for another round of test-ban talks,
presidential envoy averell harriman noted hopefully that russia was
being more pleasant in " the small things of life . " as for the big
things, " we are going in good faith and in the hope of achieving some
steps that will be beneficial . " the principal issues facing harriman
and his fellow negotiator, british minister of science viscount
hailsham, in moscow . . .test ban : khrushchev has indicated that he
would revive russia's 1961 terms for a test ban, which included a
voluntary moratorium on underground detonations, without effective
controls . this proposal was rejected by the u.s . at . the time .
then, last year, russia offered
to permit three inspections of its territory yearly by way of policing
an underground ban . moscow subsequently reneged, khrushchev now
insists that russia will never " open its door to nato spies, " and
that " this is no subject for bargaining . " the west will not accept
an unenforceable moratorium on underground tests, since it believes
that the russians would break it at will, as they violated the
voluntary test ban in 1961 . however, if russia agrees to a treaty that
simply forbids tests in the atmosphere which are easily detectable the
west is willing to take up the problem of underground testing at a
later date . .nonaggression pact . khrushchev declared that " at the
conclusion of a testban agreement, " he will revive russia's hoary
demand for a nonaggression pact between the 15 nato powers and the
satellite nations of the warsaw treaty . in the past, this proposal has
invariably been rejected by the west because west germany and france
object that it would imply western acceptance of a divided europe and
recognition of east germany . in any case, they point out, no such
declaration is needed, for nato's defensive purposes were guaranteed in
its charter 14 years ago . the prospects . u.s . policymakers emphasize
that a test-ban treaty would have little if any effect on the balance
of power . since both east and west have more than enough nuclear
warheads for any conceivable conflict, the only way either side could
gain a decisive strategic lead would be through a major breakthrough in
missile delivery systems, which would not be covered by the test ban .
in any case, nuclear technology is now so advanced that weapons such as
the anti-missile missile can be developed entirely in the laboratory .
furthermore, no western statesman believes that a test-ban agreement
will restrain the french or chinese from testing nuclear weapons at
will, or even slow the spread of nuclear arms to other nations . why,
then, is the west so eager to sign a nuclear pact with russia ?
rightly or wrongly, washington has come to view a test-ban treaty as
the touchstone of soviet intentions . if this one outstanding issue can
be resolved after five years of frustration, the state department
believes, then there is hope that east and west may ultimately be able
to settle other issues . though harriman is empowered only to negotiate
a test-ban agreement, he expects to " explore " other cold war
problems, such as berlin and russia's failure to enforce the laotian
neutrality pact . on those matters khrushchev so far did not appear to
budge . talking to belgium's foreign minister paul-henri spaak in kiev
last week, khrushchev said : " berlin is the foot that kennedy has in
europe . every time i want to, i'll stamp on it . " in short, the
east-west talks in moscow may just possibly prove no more fruitful than
the sino-soviet talks . but u.s . observers still wonder how long
khrushchev can go on fighting a twofront war, refusing both concessions
to peking and a genuine move toward " peaceful coexistence " with the
west .

communists wait till next year scarcely had the sino-soviet talks
gotten underway than the meeting headed for collapse . it did not much
matter when red china's seven-man delegation would pack their bags and
actually leave moscow ; back home peking's people's daily seemed ready
to call it quits . " we want unity, not a split, " said the voice of
red china . " but we have to point out with heavy hearts that events
have gone contrary to our hopes . the situation is very grave . "
absolute secrecy . all week there had been a strange sensation in
moscow that maybe there was no sino-soviet meeting at all . the kremlin
acted as though the showdown never took place . dom priemov, the
reception house where the sessions were supposed to be held, was
carefully avoided by soviet reporters and photographers . asked why, a
moscow news executive said sarcastically : " it's payday . they've all
gone for their money . " after meeting twice to discuss formalities,
the russians and red chinese met only three times during the next seven
days . just before one session began, a western reporter asked a soviet
plainclothesman what time the peking delegation was expected . the cop
shrugged and said : " you never know with them . they are a very
disorganized people . we waited for them yesterday, and they never did
show up . " the red chinese delegation apparently spent most of its
time driving through the lenin hills section of the city in black
limousines, shuttling mysteriously from peking's embassy to dom priemov
to the villa where they lived . western newsmen once glimpsed teng
hsiao-ping, the leader of peking's group, serenely strolling through
the villa's gardens . the only sign of life behind the massive,
cream-colored walls of dom priemov were the boots of a soviet soldier,
which protruded beneath the spiked iron gates when he opened a peephole
to scrutinize an arriving automobile . for the first time, russians
were willing to talk and even to joke about the sino-soviet conflict .
one crack making the rounds in moscow suggested that the way to solve
the whole thing was for mao tse-tung and charles de gaulle to conclude
an alliance, thus letting the two troublemakers take care of each other
. absolute equality . trhoughout the on-and-off meetings, the
ideological fire continued above the heads of the delegates . the
kremlin splashed a policy statement on the front page of pravda that
ominously warned peking of the " dangerous consequences " of its policy
. as for nikita khrushchev, he called out the brass bands, honor guard
and television cameras to welcome hungary's janos kadar, who repaid the
flattery by once again backing moscow's line of peaceful coexistence .
red china, whose delegation's arrival in moscow was downplayed by the
soviet government and deliberately ignored by the soviet press, fired
its own volley of insults . for the first time, peking claimed absolute
equality with the communist party of the soviet union and warned the
kremlin in an elaborate simile : " no genuine unity can be achieved by
an attitude that allows the magistrate to burn down houses, while
forbidding the common people even to light their lamps . " all these
sino-soviet exchanges were carefully framed to put the blame for the
split on the other fellow . obviously the chinese never expected the
moscow meeting to succeed, insisted on it merely to embarrass the
soviets . the kremlin, in turn, could not afford to appear intractable
. at week's end the peking press suggested that perhaps a few of the
sino-soviet differences could be settled soon, while others could be
deferred till later . this simply meant that the chinese were ready to
prolong the quarrel indefinitely . " if the differences cannot be
resolved this year, " said peking blandly, " they can wait until next
year . " the russians are less patient . they shot back an answering
communique warning peking that " the immediate future " will decide
whether the split will widen . then moscow gave the red chinese and the
west a pointed reminder . after all, said the soviets, " we have a
common enemy . /

.W
espionage midsummer dragnet throughout the world last week,
secret agents were on the move many of them in the direction of jail .
the u.s . had just rounded up its fourth of july catch ; west germany
was trying three spies who had penetrated its supposedly impenetrable
gehlen intelligence organization (see following story) ; and britain
had two spy thrillers running concurrently . defeated machinery . on
trial in london, italian-born atomic physicist giuseppe martelli tried
to explain away his possession of hollow-heeled shoes suitable for
concealing microfilm, cigarette packs containing thin, inflammable
message pads, sheets of rendezvous instructions, a high-powered camera,
and a super-strength radio receiver . he had accepted all these gadgets
from the russians, he said, only to string them along and then denounce
them at the right time to the british authorities . asked the judge :
/ you felt that you could defeat the whole machinery of soviet
intelligence ? " and, also in london, one of the oddest of the spy
cases came to light when the government admitted that it was granting
asylum to anatoly dolnytsin, a former senior russian intelligence
officer who defected to the west 18 months ago, and had spent the
intervening time being thoroughly pumped by u.s . and british agents .
one reported result : the revelation that british newsman h.a.r .
philby was indeed the " third man " who enabled spies burgess and
maclean to escape arrest and flee to russia in 1951 . last winter
philby, too, slipped behind the iron curtain just ahead of pursuing
mi-5 agents . although the government had made quite a show of asking
the british press not to print the story, the authorities had in fact
leaked it . laborites charged that this possibly endangered dolnytsin,
who is somewhere in a british hideout, and that dolnytsin was being
unveiled now by macmillan's government in the hope of claiming a spy
success after so many security disasters . fingered spies . so many red
spies are caught, probably because there are so many more of them
around. the u.s . state department estimates that the communist
nations employ more than 300,000 trained agents, who are helped in
their prying by the " legal " spies attached to the 46 soviet embassies
and legations in the free world . (the u.s . operates with a crack
corps of agents only about one-fifth as large.) but why were so many
red spies coming to light at once ? whenever one great power has a
big espionage roundup, as russia did last may in the trial of russian
scientist oleg penkovsky, who turned out to be a longtime western
agent, spies elsewhere brace themselves for a period of rough weather .
furthermore, there is a seasonal factor involved ; summer is the
traditional time to put the finger on spies . around the end of june,
many communist " diplomats " prepare to go home for vacations and new
instructions . having had an eye on them already, the fbi then often
decides to pounce and expose them before they can be reassigned .
native passion . one fact to emerge from the recent wave of arrests is
that the soviet apparatus seems sentimentally fond of such old
cloak-and-dagger standbys as false bottoms in valises, hidden
compartments in talcum-powder cans and toothpaste tubes, and
flashlights with message chambers instead of batteries . a russian
spy's residence usually has as many trap doors, hollow beams, false
walls, secret passages and double- and triple-locked doors as a grade b
horror movie . actually, agents both east and west have benefited
enormously from far more modern devices . it is now possible to
eavesdrop on a conversation held in the middle of an empty prairie by
simply pointing a beam of light from 500 yards away . new cameras can
take pictures in total darkness without the use of infra-red light .
finely ground lenses can zoom in from blocks away to pick up the fine
print on an insurance policy . but the soviets like the more
old-fashioned and romantic gadgets, mostly, it seems, from a native
passion for melodrama .
recently nabbed red agents include sweden's ex-military
attache stig wennerstrom ; russia's ivan egerov and wife, attached to
the u.n . secretariat ; two unidentified russians caught in washington
using the names and papers of innocent living americans, as well as a
british corporal, a french naval reservist, a uman and half a dozen
russian,  rumanian and czech diplomats .

triple double with some 125 east-bloc agents arrested every
month in their divided country, germans are blase about spy stories .
but the case that unfolded in a karlsruhe courtroom last week proved
that bonn's vaunted gehlen intelligence service had been infiltrated
for ten years by the reds, and that the organization had knowingly
hired former nazis . all three of the men on trial, longtime employees
of gehlen, were also longtime employees of the soviet union . by all
odds, it was the most embarrassing spy scandal to hit west germany
since the war . " i hate americans . " ex-wehrmacht general reinhard
gehlen, who is as secretive as any of his 5,000 men (his last known
photograph dates from 1944), set up his outfit in 1947 with the
cooperation of the cia . it was staffed largely with veteran agents who
got their training under the nazis, although gehlen himself had never
joined the nazi party . in 1955 the gehlen apparatus was turned over
from cia control to the west german government ; it reports directly
to the chancellor's office, has a top secret budget . yet in court, the
three men who penetrated its walled-in munich headquarters made the
feat sound about as difficult as joining a bavarian marching and
gymnastic society . first of the trio to face the five redrobed judges
at karlsruhe was stocky hans clemens, 61, who peered with interest at
an exhibit table covered with the tools of his trade : cameras, tape
recorders, microscopes, radios, films and suitcases with secret
compartments . as he told it, clemens had been a pianist as a youth in
dresden, but changed keys and became a nazi police official in 1933 .
he headed the dresden office of the dreaded ss security service .
during world war ii he commanded an execution squad in italy that
killed 330 hostages and for his savagery won the title " the tiger of
como . " back in germany after the war, he met a colonel " max " of
soviet intelligence, who suggested that he get a job with the gehlen
organization . it proved easy . the motive he gave for becoming a
double agent for the reds seemed like an old propaganda broadcast . " i
hate americans like the plague, " he said in court, recalling that
after american air raids on dresden he had sworn, " i shall repay them
doubly and triply . " champagne in streams . one major service clemens
performed for the russians was to recruit a former ss colleague, heinz
felfe . cool and articulate, defendant felfe, 45, told the judges that
he too was an ardent nazi, had worked his way up into heinrich
himmler's state security bureau . he bragged of his wartime successes,
which he claimed included getting first reports on teheran and yalta
from a confidant of allen dulles . after war's end he was classified by
a german denazification board as unbelastet (not incriminated) . this
astonishing fact was acknowledged by presiding judge kurt weber with an
outraged " donnerwetter ! " (thunderation) . in 1947, just 18 months
after felfe's release from a prisoner-of-war camp, he found spy work
with the british, continuing with them until, as he put it, the british
/ ran out of money . " then his old friend clemens made contact with
him on orders from colonel " max, " arranged a meeting in east berlin,
at which felfe was hired to work for the soviets . the deal was
clinched at a dinner at max's villa, where the table " was piled high
with food and champagne poured in streams . " not long afterward,
thanks to a recommendation from his friend clemens, felfe was offered a
job in the gehlen service . " now, " he said, " i was to dance at two
weddings, with the russians and with gehlen . " felfe danced up fast in
gehlen's ranks, and by the time of his arrest in 1961 had become a
department head in the counter-espionage division, specializing in
anti-soviet work . rewarding investment . the worriedlooking third
member of the group, one erwin tiebel, merely served as courier for
felfe and clemens . the spies transmitted their information by
microfilm hidden in food cans sent to east germany, by drops along the
autobahn, and by frequent trips on u.s . air force courier flights to
berlin, which they boarded under the pretext of being on gehlen
business, the three got a total of $78,000 from moscow . for the
investment,
the soviets got 15,000 microfilm photographs of west german
intelligence documents, 20 spools of tape recordings, numerous verbal
and radio reports, including the identity of many west german agents
working behind the iron curtain . as the testimony poured forth, the
outcry from west germany's press and public forced defense minister
kaiuwe von hassel to promise a " re-examination " of gehlen's
organization, and reportedly gehlen will retire soon . von hassel added
lamely : " there will always be cases of infiltration in any
intelligence service . " but the gehlen group must have set a record of
sorts . at one point, testified felfe, his russian bosses urged him to
get a transfer because there already was a surplus of soviet agents in
his department . shortly before their arrest, added felfe, he and
clemens received letters of commendation and cash bonuses from the
chairman of the soviet committee for state security.simultaneously, the
two agents got citations for ten years' meritorious service from
general gehlen .

berlin hedgehopping to freedom refugees from behind the iron
curtain have come into west berlin over rooftops and underground, by
foot, auto, train, bus, boat and armored car . last week west berlin
welcomed the first to arrive by plane polish air force major richard
obacz, 34, his german-born wife mary, 27, and their two small sons . a
jet test pilot stationed in northeast poland, major obacz received
official clearance to log extra flight time by flying his family to
visit relatives in szczecin (formerly stettin), on the east german
border . obacz crammed his wife and two sons, lester, 9, and
christopher, 5, into the rear seat of a propdriven, two-seater training
plane . only after they were aloft did he tell them over the plane's
intercom that he was making a break . to avoid communist radar
detection, he hedgehopped over the ground, never flew higher than 150
ft . throughout the entire 150-mile trip . when one polish ground
station called for his location, obacz did not reply . an hour after
take-off, obacz roared over west berlin's checkpoint charlie at rooftop
level, landed at tempelhof airport, and requested political asylum . "
i fled because i was fed up, " obacz said . " i was tired of pressure .
i wanted to work toward truth . we want the right to travel where we
want, the right of free speech, the right to work for a good cause . "

west germany the adipose society since the days when hitler opted
for guns rather than butter, west germany has known near-starvation,
austerity and, for the past decade, such heady abundance that today it
has become the adipose society . following the early '50s, when the
postwar boom set off what germans call the edelfresswelle, the gorgeous
gobbling wave, buttocks and bosoms have expanded even more rapidly than
the economy, and doctors have recognized two universal ailments :
doppelkinnepidemie, double-chin epidemic, and hangebauch, or bellyhang
. the majority of germans, from newborn babes to cabinet ministers, are
fatter today than at any other time in this century . a top dietetic
authority estimates that 20 per cent of all west germans are overweight
. in a new book titled grow thin, but how ? , dr . andreas duttler
warns : " corpulence is the dark side of the economic miracle . "
rearguard action . the explosion of vital statistics is amply evident
from the island of sylt, where pneumatic nudists jounce across the
beaches, to the spanish coastline, where bulgy brunnhildes have already
made the authorities regret their decision not to enforce a longtime
ban on bikinis . west germany's men's wear industry in recent years has
had to add a new clothing classification, tactfully dubbed boss or
manager size ; nearly a quarter of all new clothes are now bought by
customers of managerial girth, while sales of " normal " sizes are
diminishing . french garment manufacturers who export to germany sell a
higher proportion of jumbo sizes (16 to 18) there than anywhere else .
in most other countries, also, well-buttressed women steer clear of
such revealing clothes as stretch ski pants ; in west germany,
according to the world-girdling bogner stretchpants concern, there is a
steady demand for slipcover sizes . many german women are fighting a
determined rearguard action, nonetheless . sales of foundation garments
have quadrupled since 1950, and slimming parlors have become almost as
thick as germany's beloved whipped cream . in bonn, where a session at
the stylish salon der figur ranges from $6 for a plump pubescent to
$125 for a wellmarbled dowager, owner helga pietsch sighs : " ninety
percent of the german women who come in here don't even know what a
calorie is . " unconscious eating . west germany's government is doing
its level best to teach them, for the incidence of arteriosclerosis and
other fat-linked ailments is increasing relentlessly . the society for
nourishment sends 50 lady dieticians around the country giving
weight-reducing lectures, and has launched a counter-paunching
offensive aimed at leavening factory meals . the average west german
calorie intake is actually below u.s . and british levels, but such
statistics do not account for beer, which pours down teutonic throats
at the annual rate of 432 glasses (100 calories per glass) for each
man, woman and child . besides, the average german consumes more
starches and other lipogenic substances : 260 lbs . of potatoes, 155
lbs . of bread and 47 chocolate bars each year . german palates are not
easily weaned away from such belt-straining delicacies as roast goose
(500 calories for a good-sized helping) or kartoffelklosse (more than
100 each), their famed potato dumplings . throughout the country, women
hold their midmorning kaffeeklatsch at pastry shops that are as rich in
calorific temptation as the witch's cottage in hansel and gretel . tv
has also helped bring the country to polysaturation point by
encouraging what doctors call " unconscious eating . " to get through a
poker hand with maverick, germans consume vast quantities of pretzels
and pastries, and fill the gaps between snacks with
erfrischungsbonbons, refreshment candies . and they are increasingly
reluctant to take exercise . asks a garment industry official : " who
walks nowadays any more ? " top pots . if the automobile is a status
symbol in germany, so is the paunch . like julius caesar ( " let me
have men about me that are fat " ), german voters consider that sheer
heft makes a politician more kreditwurdig, or trustworthy . while
konrad adenauer has remained reasonably trim, many other politicians
have visibly gone to pot . bundestag leader heinrich von brentano was a
skinny 150-pounder when he was first elected in 1949, now weighs around
210 . former war minister franz josef strauss weighs about 270 lbs .
many top officers, notably bundeswehr inspector general friedrich
foertsch, also sport unmartial potbellies . undisputed champion is
adenauer's chosen successor, stocky (5 ft . 10 in . economics minister
ludwig erhard, who weighs about 220 lbs., but has soared far higher on
occasion . whenever a crisis threatens, such as the metalworkers'
strike last may, germans cry : " let the fat man handle it . " after
settling the strike, erhard drew roar of approval with the modest brag
: " i threw my whole weight into it . " some observers consider
waistline inflation to be merely " a cultural lag " that will be
corrected as germans accept the idea that good times are there to stay
. others, including sociologist rene konig, contend that german
corpulence is a symptom of subconscious anxiety and guilt . if only for
that reason, there seems little likelihood that germans will ever again
want lean and hungry leaders . " a thin erhard ? " asks konig . "

great britain a foolish display for three days
london's genteel west end looked like a battlefield . near buckingham
palace, squads of police grappled with leather-jacketed toughs, while
chauffeured bentleys delicately inched their way through . wild-eyed
girls with straggly black hair and bluejeaned boys with golden tresses
were frog-walked into paddy wagons . some 200 people were jailed .
taking advantage of the chaos, a six-man gang waylaid the dowager
duchess of northumberland, sped off in a white jaguar with her jewels,
worth $200,000 . most shocking of all, for the first time in her
eleven-year reign, queen elizabeth ii was booed by her own people .
cause of the trouble was the longexpected, long-disputed state visit to
britain by greece's king paul and queen frederika . fearing precisely
the kind of left-wing demonstrations that occurred last week, greek
premier constantine karamanlis advised against the trip, resigned when
the royal couple refused to bow to pressure and decided to go anyway .
british political critics base their case against the king and queen
largely on the fact that greek jails still contain about 1,000
prisoners seized more than a decade ago during the civil war ; most
are believed to be communist, and the greeks point out that they are
being gradually released anyway (the original number of prisoners was
4,000) . the queen is also accused of nazi sympathies, an old and
absurdly exaggerated charge, and of meddling too much in greek
politics, hardly a british concern . the antigreek chorus is made up of
a motley collection of communists, socialists, anti-monarchists, vague
crusaders in search of new causes, ban-the-bombers (including that
foolish sage, bertrand russell), all of them joined in the london
streets by joy-riding beatniks . amazingly, they were also joined, in
spirit, by labor party leader harold wilson and deputy leader george
brown, who chose to boycott a banquet for the visitors which could only
raise questions about the mental health and stability of british
politics . born
princess of hanover, frederika is a granddaughter of kaiser wilhelm ii
(and a great-great-granddaughter of britain's queen victoria, which
also makes her a british princess and a third cousin of queen
elizabeth) . when frederika was a year old, her family moved from
germany to austria . as a girl, she supposedly belonged to a hitlerite
youth group . in school in italy during her late teens, at a time when
three of her brothers served in the wehrmacht, she was heard to defend
nazi germany . that is about the only fact critics can cite to support
their case . after marrying paul in 1938, frederika fled greece under
nazi bombardment, lived in exile in egypt and south africa till war's
end .
agents in overalls . for the royal
visit, the macmillan government mounted a security force that outdid
even the bulganin-khrushchev welcome in 1956 . on hand were 5,000
police, including plainclothesmen disguised in everything from morning
coats to overalls . as the royal procession of carriages clipclopped
from victoria station, where elizabeth greeted them, to buckingham
palace, a woman burst from the crowd and shrieked : " release my
husband ! " she turned out to be mrs . betty ambatielos, 45, the
english wife of antonios ambatielos, a greek communist serving a life
term for his part in the civil war . that night, while the royal
couples and 156 other guests dined in buckingham palace, 2,000
demonstrators poured into trafalgar square with banners proclaiming "
down with the nazi queen . " the crowd seemed bent on storming the
palace but encountered massed lines of bobbies blocking the way .
police helmets clattered across sidewalks, fists flew, traffic stalled,
and prancing police horses bowled over crowds . rioters fought off cops
from atop a doubledeck bus . a few youths who made it to the mall were
stopped by flying tackles . " seig heil ! " for the next night, so
that the royal party could see shakespeare's a midsummer night's dream
in near-perfect security, the foreign office had bought up all 1,100
tickets to the aldwych theater, distributed them to a select audience
that included leaders of london's greek community . shortly before
curtain time, a false report that a bomb had been planted in the
theater led to the additional spectacle of police in evening clothes
combing the royal box with a mine detector . held back by six rows of
police, 1,500 people outside greeted the royal arrivals with an ugly
din of boos, hisses and mocking shouts of " sieg heil ! " and "
fascist swine . " thousands of others cheered . after the play, queen
elizabeth left the theater alone, and was greeted by another chorus of
boos . she looked startled and dismayed . it was probably the first
time that british royalty had been so publicly humiliated at home since
edward vii was hissed at epsom in the last century after rumor involved
him as a correspondent in a divorce case . worse than woolly . next
day, greek premier panayotis pipinelis, who accompanied the king and
queen, granted mrs . ambatielos a 45-minute hearing, whereupon she
calmed down . back in greece, 19 of the prisoners (not including
ambatielos) were freed . at week's end the royal couple quietly
returned to greece . said frederika before she left : " the decision
to come to britain for a state visit was the right one, absolutely
right . i am not worried about those few people who demonstrated . the
memory i have is of the warm reception we were given on our arrival . "
in britain the foolish display of the anti-greek demonstrators left
unpleasant echoes . those behind the riots, wrote the daily mirror, "
are not merely leading woolly-minded undergraduates in woolly-minded
peace protests ; they are providing a shield for mischievous communist
agitation . " the paper noted that " greece is about the only country
in eastern europe free from dictatorship, " then posed a question that
self-advertised idealists have yet to answer : when was the last time
they demonstrated in behalf of the political prisoners of lithuania or
estonia or latvia or poland or hungary or rumania or bulgaria or east
germany or czechoslovakia ?

great britain sex & the class war the profumo scandal was
re-examined last week from the viewpoint of applied political science
and the class war : prime minister harold macmillan candidly admitted
to the daily express that " the young voter is bored with me " and that
the " young ministers i put in a year ago may want to get rid of the
old gentleman at the top . " during the height of the scandal, said
mac, it was " touch and go " for several days on his " chucking it all
in . " added mac : " if it had not been for my wife and loyal staff
here, i don't think i could have got through . but i soon decided that
there was one essential duty to perform . i was determined that no
british government should be brought down by the action of two tarts .

christine keeler and marilyn ( " mandy " ) ricedavies were being
analyzed in the somewhat different role as standard bearers of the
proletariat . " here was a section of working-class girls being sold as
instruments to satisfy the sexual needs of the upper class, " wrote
mathematician hyman levy, " while at the same time, there were no
upper-class girls being recruited to satisfy the sexual needs of the
working class . " levy was ironically seconded by teacher m . l . swan
: " with a few fortunate exceptions gamekeepers and other comrades who
have infiltrated the enemy's camp we are prevented by a gigantic class
conspiracy from enjoying the daughters of our rulers and employers . if
the phrase " equality of opportunity' is to be more than a figure of
speech in britain today, this discrimination must go . " aristocrats
already " open their houses to the public at a small charge, " added
swan . if they want to prove their interest in social reform, they need
only consider " a slight extension of the services normally provided .

malaysia the quads quintuplets were expected, quadruplets
appeared . that was the story in london last week when government and
colonial leaders signed the birth certificate of a new british
commonwealth nation . it was the federation of malaysia, which was to
be composed of independent malaya, self-governing singapore, and the
three british territories of sarawak, brunei and north borneo . but at
the last moment, the oil-sodden sultanate of brunei pulled out of the
agreement in a fit of pique over the final terms of federation . macy's
v . gimbels . brunei's sudden defection came after weeks of
cliffhanging negotiations between malaya's shrewd prime minister tunku
(prince) abdul rahman, father of the federation scheme, and singapore's
brilliant, mercurial prime minister lee kuan yew . though the tunku had
demanded that singapore kick in 55 per cent of its revenues to the
federal treasury, lee managed to whittle the figure down to 40 per cent
. but overplaying his hand, he then held out for 39 per cent . so
infuriated was the tunku at this macy's v . gimbels tactic that he
delivered an ultimatum to singapore to get in the federation or stay
out and refused to go to london for the final bargaining sessions . in
london lee demanded that the british compensate singapore for continued
use of the island's naval and military facilities . britain came
through with an offshore island and an officers' club golf course,
which lee promised to turn into a botanical garden . but when the
negotiations turned to such basic matters as singapore's continued
status as a free port and its financial contribution to the
underdeveloped borneo territories, the discussions bogged down . as the
impasse continued, commonwealth secretary duncan sandys took over as
arbitrator . sandys' " absolute dedication and zeal, " said lee, "
equaled that of any dedicated communist i've ever had the misfortune to
meet . " goading, guiding, persuading, cajoling, sandys kept the
negotiators up to the small hours of the morning for four consecutive
nights . " on every occasion, we passed the time when cinderella
crumbled, " said lee . " on two occasions, we greeted the dawn . "
sulking sultan . when a breakthrough seemed near, abdul rahman flew to
london, sat in his hotel suite waiting for the signing ceremony . when
a last obstacle appeared, sandys persuaded lee to iron it out privately
with the tunku . the final agreement compromised on financial issues .
singapore will loan money to the borneo territories rather than give it
outright, and a federation common market will gradually replace
singapore's free-port status . brunei's withdrawal only slightly
jeopardizes this arrangement . brunei's rich, reactionary sultan is
mainly sulking over abdul rahman's apathy toward his ambition to play a
big ceremonial role in the new malaysia . but both the sultan and the
tunku privately admit their readiness to renew negotiations .
optimistically, the tunku announced : " this family has been nicely
settled . there is going to be a happy malaysia . /

south viet nam suicide in many forms a south vietnamese novelist
and politician named nguyen tuong tam sent his sons out to buy a bottle
of whisky one night last week . for a while he sat drinking with them
at his home in saigon . " my sons, i feel very happy tonight, " he said
. " i am going to die very soon . " suddenly he keeled over, was rushed
to a hospital where he died next morning . in his glass was found a
lethal dose of cyanide . novelist tam, 58, was a revolutionary leader
in indo-china's war against the french . but after independence in
1954, he grew increasingly disenchanted with the authoritarian rule of
south viet nam's president ngo dinh diem . fortnight ago, diem's
government charged tam and 34 others with treason by conspiring to
overthrow the president in an abortive coup attempt in november 1960 .
it was just two days before the scheduled trial that tam committed
suicide, and he explained why in a note he left behind . " the arrest
and trial of all nationalist opponents of the regime is a crime that
will force the nation into the hands of the communists, " he wrote . "
i oppose this crime, and i kill myself as a warning to those people who
are trampling on our freedoms . " dragging feet . diem's government
moved quickly to head off demonstrations over tam's death, posthumously
acquitted him of all conspiracy charges at the saigon treason trial .
at the same time, the prosecutors tried to implicate the u.s . as being
behind the 1960 coup ; the charge was vigorously denied by the u.s .
at the end of the trial, government judges sentenced 20 defendants to
prison terms ranging from five to eight years ; nine others who had
fled the country after the attempted coup were sentenced to death in
absentia . tam's suicide and the saigon trial served once again to
stoke south viet nam's smoldering religious and political crisis . last
month buddhist monk thich quang duc burned himself to death on a saigon
street corner in protest against restrictions imposed on the country's
12 million buddhists by diem's predominantly roman catholic regime .
after a series of nationwide demonstrations, the government, under u.s
. prodding, yielded to buddhist demands and granted them equal
religious and political standing with the nation's 1,500,000 catholics
. but influenced by his brother, ngo dinh nhu, who believes that the
buddhists are red dupes, the militantly catholic diem has dragged his
feet in implementing these concessions . many vietnamese buddhists,
says nhu, " have become fanatic, lost their common sense, and are ready
to follow anyone who knows how to exploit them under the banner of
religion . " this was the kind of dogged anti-buddhist attitude that
has dangerously undercut government support . already one general has
resigned his field command in protest over government bungling of the
buddhist issue . simple reason . diem's
intransigence has dismayed u.s . officials, who fear that mounting
buddhist discontent can only hinder the war effort against the viet
cong, just when it is beginning to go well . over the past year,
government forces and their 14,000 u.s . military " advisers " have
vastly increased their mobility and striking power against the red
guerrillas . more than 7,000 " strategic hamlets " have been built, now
protect 8,000,000 vietnamese from viet cong raids . despite all
misgivings, the u.s . still stands behind diem for a simple reason that
he himself spelled out in a blunt warning last week : " for a moment,
imagine that another government replaces this one : it could not help
resulting in civil war and dreadful dictatorship . " washington has
considered alternatives to diem, but fears that the confusion of a coup
could only benefit the viet cong and might end up with a regime no
better than the present one . thus u.s . ambassador frederick nolting,
who is soon to be replaced by henry cabot lodge, returned to saigon
from washington consultations last week with a personal message of
confidence for diem from john kennedy . but nolting also lightly rapped
diem on the knuckles for letting the buddhist crisis continue . " the
u.s . stands for and supports freedom of religion for all people, " he
said . " it would be a tragedy if the gains against the viet cong were
wiped out by dissensions among vietnamese citizens, who desire above
all freedom of choice for themselves and for their country .
watching one buddhist
demonstration in saigon last week, nine u.s . reporters were jostled by
government police and had their cameras smashed . the cops said the
reporters had started the row . the vociferously antidiem u.s . press
corps in saigon protested to president kennedy .

south africa family troubles family day in south africa is an
expanded version of mother's or father's day a time for all kinfolk to
get together . south africa's whites and blacks last week celebrated
the holiday in ironically contrasting ways . while whites picnicked or
frolicked on beaches, thousands of blacks mourned the absence of
relatives who were either banished or behind bars . under the country's
maze of white-supremacist apartheid rules, non-whites may be banished
from urban areas to distant villages for a variety of causes . example
: workers who have been in a city for 20 years or more may be sent
back home at once if they lose their job . others, after a lifetime's
residence in south africa, find their wives " endorsed out "  under
the new restrictions if the women were born outside south africa . in
western cape province alone, 500 men and women are now banished monthly
. even worse is the plight of some 5,800 nonwhites jailed in recent
months as part of the government's antisabotage drive, which increased
south africa's prison population to a record of some 67,700 (out of a
total population of 15 million) . bread & water . this grim aspect of
the holiday was bitterly marked by the black sash organization, a
handful of courageous white matrons, who oppose apartheid . said their
spokesman : " family day becomes a farce when so many of our african
families are disrupted . " wearing their customary black sashes,
members of the group went into retreat, sat in bare rooms on hard
chairs for 24 hours of complete silence, eating only bread and water .
the leaders of africa's new black nations observed family day in their
own manner, by trying to expel south africa from what is still
occasionally known as the family of nations . later this month, black
leaders will propose sanctions against south africa, and possibly its
expulsion from the u.n . the u.s., while violently disapproving of
apartheid, will probably abstain in any vote on the grounds that
expelling all countries whose domestic policies are reprehensible could
pretty quickly destroy the u.n . " top polecat . " not overly concerned
whether they are in or out of the club, south africa's leaders simply
went on buying modern weapons, including french jet fighters, to crush
any possible black rebellion (this year south africa's defense budget
will reach a record high of $180 million) . reporting on " sabotage
schools " in neighboring black countries, justice minister vorster said
: " we are dealing with stupid people who are power-drunk . but we are
ready for whatever they are planning against south africa . " said
afrikaaner student leader tertius delport, referring to the country's
growing international isolation : " the white south african has become
the polecat of the world . /
a colloquialism possibly growing out of the elaborate paperwork
involved in south africa's rigid control of blacks .

cold war the spirit of moscow at times it was
almost more than western veterans of many anticommunist battles could
bear . " love, " said nikita khrushchev in moscow, " love and respect
for other people is what we need . " the love feast lasted all week .
the beaming smile splashing across khrushchev's moonface, the blunt,
back-slapping peasant humor, the friendly-bear quality of the soviet
boss when he decides to be amiable all these familiar traits were on
full display in moscow as u.s., british and russian diplomats sat down
to try to negotiate a nuclear test ban agreement . with painful
memories of the shortlived " spirit of geneva " in 1955 and the
evanescent " spirit of camp david " in 1959, u.s . officials refuse to
regard khrushchev's joviality as a true barometer of east-west
relations . yet from the atmosphere around the conference table, there
was evidence that a new and possibly somewhat more durable spirit of
moscow was in the making . detectable chair . the easy mood prevailed
from the moment the negotiators arrived . chief u.s . negotiator
averell harriman brought with him three tons of telephone equipment,
for the " hot line " that is to link the white house and the kremlin in
emergencies . at the first meeting, harriman, 71, was greeted by
khrushchev with a cheery " you're absolutely blooming . what are you
doing, counting your years backward ? " when britain's top envoy,
viscount hailsham, said that moscow's weather was better than london's,
khrushchev replied : " we could perhaps find some place for you here .
you could be an internee . " finally the principals sat down at the
conference table, accompanied by their top aides foreign minister
andrei gromyko, deputy foreign minister valerian zorin, and chief
disarmament negotiator semyon tsarapkin on the russian side, u.s .
ambassador foy kohler and british ambassador sir humphrey trevelyan for
the west . said khrushchev : " we begin immediately with the signing .
/ added gromyko : " then all that will remain will be to fill the
treaty in . " during the early sessions, it almost seemed that easy .
khrushchev said that, since it had been impossible to reach agreement
on a full ban in the past, the time had come to achieve more by
attempting less . he gave soviet approval to a limited ban which would
cover all tests except those underground, repeating his familiar
opposition to onsite inspections of possible underground blasts . as
usual, gromyko argued that such inspections were unnecessary anyway, in
view of long-range seismic detection devices . when the sudden crash of
an accidentally overturned chair startled the delegates, gromyko said
quickly : " this is confirmation that everyone detects it . " growled
hailsham : " it still needs inspection . /
selling mood .
arguing that underground
blasts can indeed be detected from far off but not differentiated from
earthquakes, the u.s . is nevertheless willing to defer the question .
as for khrushchev, he was in a selling mood . drawing out of the hat a
five-year-old soviet proposal, he called for the establishment of
inspection posts at airfields, highways, railroad stations and ports on
both sides of the iron curtain to reduce the possibility of surprise
attack . he also proposed 1) freezing or reduction of military budgets,
2) a reduction of the armed forces on both sides in east and west
germany, and 3) a nonaggression pact between the nato and warsaw pact
powers . he even seemed willing to accept the u.s . idea of parallel
but separate declarations instead of a formal pact, which would avoid
implicit u.s . recognition of the east german communist regime . the
sudden arrival in moscow of a high-level east german delegation that
included walter ulbricht's berlin specialist, immediately raised
speculation that berlin was on the agenda . but any possible deal
involving berlin or the balance of forces in europe would require u.s .
consultation with its allies . west germany wasted little time in
warning the u.s . that any agreement other than a test ban would not
only usher in a period of " false security " in europe, but would also
make it increasingly difficult for the u.s.'s european allies to heed
washington's pleas for higher nato military expenditures or to respect
the embargo of " strategic materials " to the east . no obstacles .
why, after years of stalling, is khrushchev pushing a test ban treaty
and a detente with the west ? western diplomats point to the
sino-soviet split as the main reason (see following story) engaged in
an all-out power struggle with the chinese, khrushchev presumably wants
a test ban treaty to demonstrate to communists all over the world the
feasibility of " peaceful coexistence . " nor would khrushchev mind
cutting down a little on the prohibitive cost of nuclear testing and
production, which impedes his oft-stated desire to raise living
standards in the soviet union . lastly, while a test ban would not be
binding on either france or red china, it would place the onus of
defying the agreement on them . president kennedy suggested at his
press conference last week that in the event of an accord, the three
negotiators go to geneva and get the signatures of the 17-nation geneva
disarmament conference . such an arrangement would box in the french
with something more than an " anglo-saxon " -soviet agreement from the
viewpoint of russia's quarrel with the chinese, it would also put such
geneva " neutrals " as egypt, burma and india on the record as
supporting a soviet-sponsored agreement . at week's end a test ban
agreement seemed near . bantering with harriman at a reception,
khrushchev said : " the talks are going on well . there have been no
obstacles . if they go on as they have, an agreement is in sight . "

communists " get out of here " and so the
chinese went home . at the airport, when a western correspondent asked
teng hsiao-ping, the chief of peking's departing delegation, how the
talks had gone, he replied, " very good . " obviously, the opposite was
true . during their last week in moscow, while western negotiatiors
were feted and flattered, a kind of great wall surrounded the unwelcome
visitors from peking . from their isolated compound on moscow's lenin
hills, the red chinese delegates ventured out only in curtained black
chaika limousines for the short drive to peking's embassy ; on
alternate days they met with a soviet delegation, obviously to no
effect . khrushchev pointedly stayed away from the meetings, although
he was otherwise active in the diplomatic and social whirl . the moscow
film festival provided an excuse for lots of parties, at which western
envoys and soviet functionaries mixed amiably with such movie stars as
shelly winters, susan strasberg, yves montand and simone signoret . at
week's end khrushchev finally turned to his other guests and, in a
relatively gracious gesture, tossed the red chinese a farewell dinner .
although described as " friendly, " the meal could have produced little
beyond dyspepsia, for khrushchev had spoiled the table talk in advance,
delivering an oratorical blast at peking that in effect declared
political war on the chinese . the challenge . at a massive rally of
party bureaucrats and propagandists in the kremlin's palace of the
congresses, khrushchev spoke with such apoplectic vehemence that at one
point he groped for words and rhetorically begged the audience : "
help me out . " but he didn't need much help . angrily defending his
destalinization drive against peking's attacks, he demanded : " what
do they want ? to frighten our people, to bring back the days when a
man went to his job and did not know whether he would see his wife and
children again ? " dropping his voice to a dramatic whisper,
khrushchev said that letters to him from all over the country expressed
gratitude for ending the stalinist terror . then he added :. " if
stalin had died ten years earlier, it would have been even better . "
the soviet boss was equally contemptuous on the subject of peking's
warmongering foreign policy . " they say one should start a revolution,
a war, " he shouted, " and on the corpses and the ruins, a more
prosperous society will be created . and who would remain in this
prosperous society ? wouldn't the living envy the dead ? " directly
accusing the chinese of trying to unseat him, khrushchev dared peking
to take its case to the soviet people : " i declare to those who would
like to overthrow us i challenge you, comrades let's pick out any plant
or collective farm . you present your program and we will present ours
. you won't need armor or a pillow for protection . our people are
polite . they'll listen and say : " get out of here . /
bourgeois comrades . almost as vehement was
a 19,000-word open letter from the kremlin that called the chinese
liars, hypocrites and cowards . moscow dismissed the red chinese claim
to proletarian purity and accused them of trying to goad russia into
war with the u.s . printed in pravda, the soviet counterattack was
addressed to communist cadres throughout the world and it served notice
that moscow would push its platform before all 81 " fraternal " parties
at all costs . as the soviets themselves angrily pointed out, peking
was actively " organizing and supporting bands of renegade " reds in
seven nations throughout the world the sino-soviet quarrel has sharply
divided local communist parties, splitting race from race and continent
from continent . in europe the quarrel is noisiest among the italian
comrades . nowhere does the communist party seem more bourgeois ; for
just that reason, nowhere in europe has peking found more supporters
for its credo of all-out revolution . in padua a group of communist
party members, expelled for favoring peking, published a pamphlet
denouncing red bureaucrats who lived the sweet life, complete with "
wives and mistresses in jewels and furs . " some 30,000 italian reds,
many of them sons of prominent communists, have formed about 20
chapters of the chinese-italian friendship society . the rebels are
backed by funds believed to be channeled through the albanian legation
in rome ; they circulate propaganda material prepared by red chinese
specialists operating from a fancy villa in bern, switzerland . last
week communist party vice secretary luigi longo rushed to milan to put
down a rebellion of sinophiles, and explained that by appearing
moderate, italian reds have prospered at the polls . as he emerged from
the meeting, longo discovered the slogans " viva stalin, " / viva mao "
painted on nearby walls . airmail war . in africa and asia the split is
increasingly racial . the soviets are complaining that at the recent
asian-african solidarity conference in tanganyika, a red chinese
official told the moscow delegation : " the whites have nothing to do
here . " such a blatant racist line, argues moscow, is pursued in the
underdeveloped areas at russia's expense ; it " implants the sneaky
idea that the peoples of some regions are more revolutionary than
others . " india's communist movement has been deeply divided, but last
week formally lined up with khrushchev, just as an indian government
purchasing commission arrived in moscow shopping for arms to be used in
defense against the red chinese . in japan, most of whose communists
favor red china for ethnic reasons, the struggle has become pretty
petty, resulting in an airmail circulation war . soon after pravda
began to arrive in tokyo by air, peking's people's daily dropped its
seamail delivery, which used to take a month, and also took to the air
at no increase in postal rates to subscribers . the nightmare . though
the leadership of most latin american communist parties is firmly
pro-moscow, the rank and file lean toward peking . reds in brazil have
split into three rival sects . one of uruguay's top reds was recently
expelled for his red chinese sympathies ; however, the party newspaper
still accepts paid announcements from peking propagandists . as for the
beard, fidel's revolutionary sympathies lie with mao, but he knows
better than to bite nikita's hand, and last week he dutifully endorsed
the moscow line . still, red china has not given up hope of converting
castro . cuba is one of the few places in the world where both chinese
and russian technicians remain at work . this month peking happily
proclaimed that its experts have helped the cubans to raise 25,000
peking ducks . these sino-soviet duels around the world, as much as the
fruitless talks in moscow, have shattered any prospect of early
reconciliation . now that the moscow meeting has collapsed, both sides
in effect concede that what began as a charade of unity has become a
communist nightmare .

south viet nam the buddhist crisis in saigon's huge xa
loi pagoda, buddhist monks and nuns were holding a 48-hour hunger
strike against the regime of south viet nam's president ngo dinh diem .
expecting trouble, police sealed off nearby streets with barbed wire .
to prevent a repetition of the ritualistic suicide last month, when a
protesting buddhist monk burned himself to death on a saigon street
corner, two fire trucks were on hand . suddenly, about 500
saffron-robed buddhist priests, laymen and women emerged from a nearby
alley and started to run toward the pagoda to join their fasting
fellow-buddhists . stymied by wire and police, the demonstrators sat
down in the middle of the street . riot squads arrived . armed with a
walkie-talkie radio, two sport-shirted american c.i.a . men delivered a
running commentary on events to headquarters . a monk with a portable
loudspeaker repeated : " we have been deceived many times and we no
longer have any faith in the regime . " government secret police in
civilian clothes yelled back that the buddhists were being exploited by
the communists . then the police charged the peaceful seated crowds,
causing one of the ugliest scenes in south viet nam's three-months-old
buddhist crisis . at gunpoint . with rifle butts, clubs and tommy-gun
clips, the cops battered the demonstrators . women who had fallen to
the pavement in the first police rush were savagely kicked . a young
girl had her head split open with a carbine butt, and as blood streamed
into her eyes, she was carted away in a police van . from the windows
of a brothel, girls shouted insults at the police until forced inside
at machine-gun point . throughout south viet nam, government forces
crushed buddhist demonstrations with similar violence, arrested nearly
300 marchers in saigon alone, following orders to " use any means " to
disperse buddhist demonstrations . top u.s . embassy people in saigon
were " shocked and disgusted " by the diem government's action . one
monk delivered a protest note to the embassy, urging the u.s . to force
diem to relent ; u.s . ambassador frederick e . nolting telephoned
vietnamese officials and got assurances that the man would not be
molested . but no sooner had the monk left than secret police agents
tried to spirit him away in a waiting taxi . the priest fought them off
and raced back toward the u.s . embassy . a u.s . official dragged him
to safety through the door as a husky marine guard peeled a vietnamese
cop from the priest's back . morality crusade . ironically, the crisis
involves one of the world's most docile religions . yet, in a sense,
that very quality makes buddhism a problem . since it knows no sense of
sin, and hence no reprisal for error, it is, at least by western
standards, passive, backward and neutral . buddhism, says theologian
paul tillich, " gives no decisive motives for social transformation,
and thus provides a nonpolitical opportunity for an invasion of
buddhist east asia by the communist quasi-religion with its hope for a
transformed world . " although the red chinese are wooing the buddhists
everywhere, there is no real evidence so far that the reds are using
south viet nam's buddhists, as the diem government charges . on the
other hand, diem has not succeeded in using them either unlike
thailand's strongman sarit thanarat, who has shown that,when handled
properly, they can be a solid, anti-communist force .
until recently, the buddhists
in south viet nam had no real case against diem . since the buddhists
were south viet nam's dominant group for centuries and resent roman
catholicism as the religion of their former french masters diem has
taken pains not to show obvious favoritism toward fellow catholics .
only three of 19 army generals and five of 17 cabinet ministers are
catholics . though nearly half of the 123-member national assembly is
catholic, this is largely because catholic schools turn out better
educated graduates than buddhist schools . most vietnamese nevertheless
believe that diem's catholic ruling family has shown bias . primarily
middle-class landowners, vietnamese catholics are economically far more
advanced than the buddhists . thousands of buddhists have become
converts to catholicism in the hope that this would help them
professionally or economically . buddhists claim that the government
gives catholics better land for schools and church buildings and
discriminates against buddhist students in granting state scholarships
. unlike other religious groups, buddhists must have special government
permits to hold large meetings . " this puts us in the same category as
the trade unions, " says one buddhist priest . with their free and easy
mores, buddhists also complain about the morality crusade of mme . ngo
dinh nhu, wife of diem's brother and closest adviser . mme . nhu has
banned polygamy, concubinage, dancing, and even fighting fish . hard
line . all these discontents need not have erupted if government troops
had not stupidly and brutally gunned down nine buddhist demonstrators
at a rally in hue two months ago . even then, the buddhist controversy
would probably have died down if the government had offered a public
apology, which is the buddhists' chief demand, along with such
practical matters as freedom of assembly, the right to fly their flag,
buddhist chaplains in the army . but brother ngo dinh nhu has always
urged a hard line . what he fears with some reason is that if diem
gives in even slightly to the buddhists, it would only cause new
demands that would eventually threaten the government's whole power
structure . by week's end, however, in a belated attempt to ease
tensions, the government ordered the release of 267 buddhists arrested
during the demonstrations . though head priest thich tinh khiet said
that he has lost confidence in diem's " high virtue, " no top buddhist

syria throwing away the script syrian army revolts usually
resemble the ancient battles of chinese warlords : there is a head
count of men and material in the opposing armies and the larger wins a
bloodless victory . the losers are then jailed or exiled to wellpaying
diplomatic posts abroad . not so last week, when syria experienced its
twelfth attempted coup d'etat in 14 years and the only one to throw
away the script . led by ex-colonel jassem alwan, who had already
staged an unsuccessful coup last year, a band of army officers and
civilians launched a morning attack in damascus on the radio station
and the defense ministry . diplomats in britain's new green and yellow
embassy got off a cable home : " heavy fighting in the heart of the
city . " the gunfire lasted for four hours, and three syrian mig
fighter planes serving either the government, the rebels, or their own
whim knocked out the radio transmitter . when the radio limped back on
the air, it was still in government hands . the strongman of syria's
ruling baath (renaissance) party, general mohammed hafez, who is both
defense minister and army chief of staff, broadcast that the effort "
to disturb the peace " had been crushed . next day he announced the
break in the rules of syrian-style coups : eight rebel military men
and twelve civilians had been executed . hafez blamed the revolt on
syrian supporters of egypt's gamal abdel nasser, who is feuding with
baath-ruled syria over control of the proposed new arab federation but
mideastern observers could not understand why nasserites would begin a
revolt on the very day that syria's president louai atassi was flying
to cairo to make concessions to nasser . even baath party newspapers
conceded that syria was at last ready to accept nasser's demand for a "
national front " federation in which his supporters would have equal
strength with baath . after a ten-hour conference with nasser,
president atassi flew home and rushed to the military hospital to kiss
the soldiers wounded in defending his regime . at week's end damascus
radio was still making brief, shrill broadcasts insisting that the
revolt was crushed, bu the country remained buttoned up against the

espionage mistaken identities latest installments of two
international spy cases : in london's old bailey, a jury pondered the
crown's case against italian nuclear scientist giuseppe martelli,
including the elaborate espionage equipment found in his possession and
his repeated contacts with known soviet agents . defendant martelli
readily admitted most of the crown's charges, but explained that he had
merely been stringing out the negotiations with the reds in order to
denounce them at the right moment to british authorities . after
deliberating for nine hours and 47 minutes, the jurors decided to
believe martelli and declared him not guilty . in both london and
moscow, there was considerable confusion about the important soviet
official who defected to the west 18 months ago, was thoroughly
interrogated in the u.s., and is now a resident of britain . the man's
name was given as anatoly dolnytsin, and the daily telegraph alertly
noted that a diplomat of the same name had served for nine months in
the soviet embassy in london . moscow's izvestia then got into the act,
insisting that, far from defecting, dolnytsin had left his london post
in 1961 and had been working ever since at the foreign ministry in
moscow (to prove its point, izvestia even published his picture) .
questions raised in britain's house of commons got only an
acknowledgment that somebody did defect from russia 18 months ago and
had been given asylum in britain . possibly, there had been two russian

great britain the saga of polish peter like the overturning of a
deeply embedded rock, the profumo scandal caused a frantic scurrying of
a great many odd human insects . one of the crawliest figures to emerge
was that of peter rachman, who may, or may not, be dead . last week
press and parliament were abuzz with his sordid story . rachman looked
the part of an ian fleming villain . short and fat, with grotesquely
tiny hands and feet, he had no neck, a bald head shaped like a soccer
ball, and sunken blue eyes always hidden behind dark glasses . he
dressed flashily, wore elevator shoes of crocodile leather . it amused
him to watch naked lady wrestlers, and he had a fetish about hygiene,
insisting that all his silverware be sterilized and untouched by human
hands . more than most men, rachman loved money and women . white chief
. in 1946, when he was 26, polish-born rachman had arrived in britain
virtually penniless and possessing a stateless person's passport . at
first, he found postwar britain a bleak place . his english was poor,
and he labored as kitchen helper, insurance agent and black marketeer .
he made his bid for fortune in the early 1950s by borrowing $2,500 to
buy a lodging house near london's harrow road . the house cost so
little because seven of its eight rooms were occupied by tenants
protected by rent control and immune from eviction . rachman rented the
one empty room to a party of eight west indian musicians who were
encouraged to hold nightlong parties and raise hell ; they did, to
such good effect that the seven white tenants moved out within three
months and were replaced by swarms of west indians paying vastly
inflated rents . eighteen months later, rachman sold the house for five
times what he had paid for it, and moved on to further real estate
triumphs in the rundown areas of paddington, bayswater and notting hill
. in his single-minded effort to get lowrent tenants out of his houses
and highrent tenants in, rachman hired men to urinate in hallways,
smash furniture, and once in bayswater to remove the roof of a house
and abandon the stubborn tenants to the mercy of wind and weather . in
the underworld he got the name of " polish peter, " and west indians,
who knew his power, called him " white chief rachman man . " bent
basement . the rent act of 1957 virtually lifted all controls and
enabled rachman to shoehorn tenants into his flats at whatever prices
the traffic would bear . he also showed talent for " bending the
basement, " that is, converting cellar space into cribs for prostitutes
or into nightclubs the 1959 street offences act, which drove
prostitutes off london pavements, brought him another windfall, for the
girls would pay more for rooms than even the desperate west indians .
in one house, seven prostitutes were charged $10 per day, payable every
day at noon, or $25,000 annually, for a house valued at $4,200 .
the saga of polish
peter     rachman was never once found guilty of an illegal act, and
never once paid a personal income tax . police and public health
officers nearly lost their minds trying to trace the true ownership of
his 400 to 500 buildings . they would discover that in a single rachman
house different owners were listed for different floors ; one company
would have a lease to collect rents, another to make repairs, and a
third would simply be holding the house " in trust " for one of
rachman's myriad firms . by 1959, rachman had enough money to start
dealing in better-class apartments, hotels and office buildings . he
married audrey o'donnell, a pretty lancashire girl who had served as an
officer in his multiple corporations, and moved into a mock-georgian
mansion just off hampstead heath's millionaires' row . the garage was
large enough to house their six cars . numbers fame . always on the
lookout for girls for his personal use, rachman frequently visited the
several nightclubs he owned, and would sit in a corner like a satanic
kewpie, a cigar in his mouth, diamonds on his pudgy fingers, a blonde
juvenile obediently at his side, and a bodyguard in the background .
christine keeler was one of his many mistresses, and in october 1960,
he set up mandy rice-davies, christine's sometime roommate, in a west
end apartment complete with a two-way bedroom mirror and a tape
recorder beneath the bed . " in our two happy years, " said mandy later
/ he gave me a mink coat, three mink jackets, a persian lamb jacket,
three diamond brooches, two pairs of diamond and ruby earrings, a big
gold diamond and ruby watch, two diamond rings, and a jaguar . for my
18th birthday, he gave me $2,800 in cash . " while gambling at a london
casino one night last november, rachman felt ill . he was rushed to
edgware general hospital, and perhaps died of a heart attack . on his
wrist was a gold bracelet whose inside, as a hospital attendant
described it, was covered with series of numbers that could be either
safe combinations or account numbers in swiss banks . whatever rachman
did with his reputed fortune, of $25 million, it was not found in his
personal estate, which came to about $20,000 . rachman's own fate is as
mysterious as his missing money . the london underworld buzzes with
rumors that there was a body switch at edgware, and rachman has
reportedly been seen everywhere from manhattan to paris . the question
was raised in parliament, but last week scotland yard and investigating
newsmen were satisfied that the real rachman was dead and that his
corpse lies buried in an unmarked grave in a hertfordshire cemetery .

west germany the oldest grad the tall, gangling youth with the
kaiser wilhelm mustache was a model of self-discipline at the
university of freiburg . limited to a small monthly allowance of $21,
he was never known to squander or borrow a pfennig . at night, nodding
over his law books, he would take off his shoes and socks, immerse his
feet in a tub of cold water to stay awake . he never fought a duel, but
he was no square . he pledged a fraternity, acquired the " biername "
(drinking nickname) of " toni, " and at frothy functions would bang his
stein on an oak table in unison with the rest of them . later, in
cologne, he dazzled the frauleins at the local pudelnass (sopping wet)
tennis club . among those who knew him, many were surprised when konrad
adenauer (class of 1897) grew up to be a politician and eventually
chancellor of west germany . last week adenauer's college days became a
topic of national discussion . addressing a nostalgic reunion of alte
herren (old grads), the chancellor defended germany's tradition of
fraternities, which are widely accused of fostering authoritarianism .
though at 87 adenauer has seen most if not all of his old fraternity
classmates die, he is still a loyal member of arminia (motto : true
! free ! ) . said der alte : " when a student enters the
university, he or she is neither a finished man nor a finished woman .
one is never completely finished in life . a boy needs a special
atmosphere . it is like a plant that grows up, or a young tree . it
depends on how the air is, on the surroundings he is in, on the earth
that gives him nourishment . i believe a studentenkorporation
(fraternity) can give a young student a great deal . i look back at my
student time and can only say that the atmosphere which i found in the
fraternities has affected me for my whole life . the student can only
be raised by the fellowship of his peers . " as for the burgeoning
revival of fraternities since world war ii (40 per cent of west german
students now belong), der alte maintained that " after the terrible
collapse at the end of the war, the rise of such a tradition is of very
vital and great significance for all the german people . "     after
his speech, adenauer took time to inspect the special offices in bonn's
parliament building that are being made ready for him to occupy after
his oftpostponed but now firmly promised retirement as chancellor this
fall . when he steps down, adenauer is supposed to confine himself to
being a parliamentary deputy, national chairman of his christian

france l'amour for la patrie the people of paris celebrated
summer in the traditional way . young couples were laced together under
the trees of the bois de boulogne, locked lip-to-lip on the metro
stairs, snuggled flank-to-flank on the swimming barges moored along the
seine . to the gaullists in the national assembly there was only one
thing wrong with this surfeit of love : it is not producing enough
babies . introducing new legislation designed to change that situation,
ex-premier michel debre warned : " there is a direct and immediate
link between the weight of our population and our future in europe and
the world . " no explosion . debre could have appealed to history .
when napoleon's armies swept over the continent 160 years ago, france
contained one-fifth of europe's population . today it represents
one-twentieth, and only immigration has kept france from losing
population . since 1946, france's annual birth rate has stabilized at
between 18 and 19 per 1,000 people . though well below the u.s . rate
of 23.4, france is now actually doing better than most of its neighbors
. in western europe generally, the birth rate has slowly but steadily
declined over the past decade, possibly because of postwar uneasiness
about the future, the shortage of new housing that continues despite
the economic boom, and the decision of newlyweds to space the arrival
of children . the decline is even more rapid in the communist
countries, especially poland and yugoslavia, where the rate has dropped
from 28 to 22 per 1,000 in the same period, partly because communist
governments sanction legal abortions . thus, ironically, while asia,
africa and south american still fear the population explosion, europe
fears the opposite . no drinking . france has long fought the trend by
offering bonuses for large families and by severely outlawing abortions
as well as female contraceptive devices and the spread of birth control
information . to achieve a national average of at least three children
per family, debre last week proposed 1) priority in apartments for
young couples with children, 2) tax exemptions to families in the year
they produce a fourth child, 3) a more " receptive government attitude
toward unwed mothers . " he also wants frenchmen to lay off the bottle,
because " each generation we lose a total of 500,000 persons due to
overindulgence . " opposition came from socialist and communist
deputies who argued that it was unrealistic to talk of increasing the
population while french housing remained in its present wretched state
. but debre is strongly backed by president charles de gaulle, who
hopes that france's present population of 47 million will grow to 100
million by the century's end .

with rotten eggs by white extremists brandishing placards reading, "
hang kenyatta ! " yet last week, as his country's newly elected prime
minister, kenyatta was a hero to most of kenya's remaining white
farmers . at nakuru, capital of the former white highlands, 400 farmers
crowded the town hall to hear him, determined to base their decision to
leave kenya or to stay on what he had to tell them (in the past two
years, 6,000 have left, but 60,000 remain) . kenyatta appealed to the
whites to forgive and forget, to join hands with his three-month-old
african government and prove that different racial groups can live
harmoniously together . " there is no society of angels, black, brown
or white, " said kenyatta . " we are human beings and as such we are
bound to make mistakes . if i have done a mistake to you, it is for you
to forgive me . if you have done a mistake to me, it is for me to
forgive you . " he assured the white settlers that they would be
allowed to farm their land without interference, though the government
will use idle land, and promised more police action to prevent the
stealing of cattle . when he finished, the white farmers roared
kenyatta's battle cry of " harambee ! " , a swahili expression
meaning " let's all push together get up and go . " not all were won
over . but most decided to stay in kenya so long as jomo kenyatta
continued saying and doing the right things . his speech, said farmer

depository officer . in moscow a variety of foreign office types
ushered the diplomats into a dazzling gold-and-white marble room in the
spiridonovka palace . in both cities, and in london as well, the
emissaries of nation after nation lined up to sign the nuclear test ban
treaty . eventually, by state department estimate, there will be more
than 100 signatories . khrushchev called it " a referendum on all
continents . " inevitably, the world's attention focused on the
nonsigners . chief among them is, of course, red china . heightening
their bitter ideological quarrel with moscow, the chinese charged that
four years ago nikita khrushchev had welshed on a promise to help them
make atomic bombs because he wanted to present " a gift " to president
eisenhower on the eve of the camp david talks . in a bitter radio
attack, the chinese said that the " real aim of the soviet leaders " in
negotiating the test ban " is to compromise with the u.s . in order to
maintain a monopoly of nuclear weapons and lord it over the socialist
camp . " peking added that khrushchev had committed an act of "
betrayal " resulting in " open capitulation by the soviet leaders to
u.s . imperialism . " the slow ones . china's antitreaty stand was
backed by avowedly pro-peking albania, north korea and north viet nam .
so far, these are the only countries that have formally announced that
they will not sign . but chary of angering the chinese, other asian
nations have been slow to indicate their approval of the pact . they
include nepal, which lies in an exposed position in china's border
conflict with india ; ceylon and cambodia, both leftwing " neutrals "
; and indonesia, which is hopeful of chinese support in any future
action against the soon-to-be-born malaysian federation . to moscow's
consternation, the only communist nation that has not yet spoken out
one way or the other in the worldwide " referendum " is cuba . despite
the $1,000,000 a day that russia is pouring into his island commune,
fidel castro is still angry over khrushchev's withdrawal of soviet
rockets last fall . trying to make the soviet leader sweat, castro is
obviously attempting to boost his price for supporting russia in its
struggle with the chinese . but there is little doubt that cuba will
ultimately sign the treaty, for castro needs russia to buy his
3,800,000-ton sugar crop and to continue steady transfusion of economic
aid . the lonely ones . the sole nonsigner in the western camp is
france . even franco spain, the only western country which does not
have diplomatic relations with moscow, has signed the treaty, leaving
france isolated from all its continental neighbors . most galling to
charles de gaulle was west germany's decision to sign the pact after a
reassuring pitch in bonn by u.s . secretary of state dean rusk . bonn's
action was doubly upsetting to france, for it followed an announcement
that germany and the u.s . will cooperate in the development of a new
battle tank (time, aug . 16) ; just three months ago, paris was unable
to reach an agreement with the germans on a similar project . both bonn
decisions raised the question of just how much the franco-german
friendship treaty is worth, and brought into the open the fact that
west germany still looks to the u.s . and not to france for leadership
. stubbornly france prepared for another atomic test in the sahara, but
de gaulle's aspirations to french leadership of europe were acidly
demolished by paris' le figaro . " if khrushchev really becomes
disturbed by the campaign conducted against him by china, " said the
paper, " and if he wants to have a certainty of peace on his western
front, then he will not come to seek agreement with france, which is
negligible in his eyes, even with atomic weapons, but with the u.s.,
whose influence and power are one hundred times superior . this was
proved at the recent conference in moscow, where we shone by our

west germany it is still there two years have passed since
berlin was severed by the wall . on its anniversary last week, most
west berliners heeded official appeals to refrain from violent, futile
demonstrations . instead, they observed the day quietly by placing
wreaths on the dozens of crosses marking each spot where a fleeing east
german had been shot to death by communist guards . only late in the
evening was the city's grave calm broken by a mob of some 2,000
hell-raising west berliners who surged into the area around checkpoint
charlie, hurling rocks and insults across the wall into the soviet
sector . if germans have learned to live with the berlin wall and the
deadly, 830mile barricade that divides the rest of their nation, on
neither side have they forgotten or forgiven its existence . the most
eloquent evidence of east germans' refusal to accept sovietization is
that 16,456 of them have risked their lives and fled to the west since
the wall went up . among them were 1,304 members of east germany's army
and police force, enough to form 13 companies . at least 65 more east
germans are known to have been killed while attempting to escape .
facts of life . despite this somber chronicle of flight and death, many
politicians and pundits outside germany still cling to the notion based
in part on deep-rooted fear of resurgent german power that its people
are gradually becoming reconciled to their country's partition . in
west germany itself, this view is accepted in some quarters, mostly
because it is a fact of present european life that the russians cannot
be moved out of east germany, except by war, a west german surrender to
communism, or some kind of settlement for which west germany might have
to pay a ruinous price . as a result, many germans are beginning to
ponder measures that fall short of actual reunification such as trade
pressure designed to persuade walter ulbricht to give east germans a
little more freedom and a somewhat better life . franz thedieck, state
secretary for all-german affairs, said recently : " of course we would
like to see germany reunited, but if there were conditions of freedom
in east germany the existence of one single german state would not be
absolutely necessary . " existential philosopher karl jaspers created a
furor by suggesting in 1960 that his countrymen must accept changes in
the map of germany as part of their liability for hitler . many germans
now accept his thought : " the only thing that counts is freedom .
compared with that, reunification is a matter of indifference the
thought is largely academic, since it would be almost as difficult to
liberalize the ulbricht regime as to get the russians out of east
germany . the jaspers line thus may temper but does not eliminate the
basic urge for reunification in a country which achieved national unity
later than other european nations and is fiercely insistent on its
ethnic identity . hence bonn's opposition to any east-west agreement
that would formally or psychologically seal the status quo . says a
western ambassador in bonn : " the issue of german unity still has
more explosive potential than any other issue on the political scene in
germany today . we'd be fools to underestimate it . " shift to right .
far from symbolically and physically sealing germany's division, the
wall has become a constant, inescapable reminder to west germany's 57
million citizens that 17 million of their compatriots live in privation
and terror . older germans, including distinguished sociologist helmut
schelsky, have warned repeatedly that a complacent younger generation
will in time come to regard their compatriots " over there " as
foreigners . however, german students on the whole seem to agree with
christa roll, a 23-year-old munich student, who argues that idealistic
youngsters have been deeply affected by the wall . since it went up,
she says, " the intellectual center of gravity has shifted to the right
. before that, a lot of liberals would still put in a good word for
east germany now and then . but the wall changed them, for it was
exactly the kind of ugly suppression that every progressive is
supposedly fighting against . " most germans even those who acknowledge
that reunification cannot become reality in the foreseeable future
agree that it is a moral imperative . recent opinion polls show that 54
per cent of west germany's citizens consider their country's division "
an unbearable situation . " another survey, taken last year, indicated
that 40 per cent consider reunification the nation's most urgent
problem ; only 17 per cent gave first priority to the preservation of
peace . evidence of their continuing concern for their kin is the rise
in west germans' shipments of food and clothing to communist germany :
from 35 million in 1950, the number of packages crossing the border has
risen to more than 52 million a year . a whole new literature in west
germany concerns itself with the alienation of east and west, " the
dreaded dreadful strangeness, " as uwe johnson wrote in speculations
about jakob, in which friends and relatives divided by the border
gradually cease to be individuals in each other's eyes, instead become
political symbols . emotionally, at least, a united nation remains the
aspiration of a vast majority of west germans . the u.s . would only
pave the way for a new and dangerous wave of german nationalism by
ignoring it .

superior to their dialects or not ? does the religion preached by the
missionaries surpass fetishism or not ? is not belonging to a nation
of civilized expression and world projection better than narrow
regionalism without means for defense or progress ? " reasonable
questions, to be sure, but they simply came too late in the day as did
salazar's offer to africans of " the closest and most friendly
cooperation, if they find it useful . " otherwise, portugal would
defend its territories " to the limit of our resources, if they think
fit to turn their threats into acts of war . " as for the u.n., which
two weeks earlier called anew for curtailment of arms to portugal, he
saw the " massive entry " of afro-asian states as having distorted the
world organization into a threat to peace . and in a bitter jab at his
nato partner, the u.s., which has been urging portugal to decolonize,

wealthy bourgeois . last month brazzaville's three trade unions, one of
which is communist, demanded reforms . youlou promised labor a say in a
new, single-party government that he planned to proclaim . satisfied,
the unions eased off . but fortnight ago, word began circulating that
youlou was about to renege . promptly the unions called a general
strike ; last week, on the eve of the strike, two labor leaders were
arrested . fall of the messiah . as the walkout began, brazzaville was
shut tight, and 1,500 demonstrators gathered for a morning rally at the
railroad station . suddenly mounted congolese gendarmes charged them
with sabers flashing . the ragged mob burst through police lines and
surged toward the city prison, hurling stones and bricks . at the
prison entrance, police opened fire, killing at least three .
undeterred, the mob battered down the steel gate, freed 480 elated
prisoners . moving on, the rioters set about burning homes and cars of
government officials .
both call themselves
republic of the congo, list themselves unofficially by the names of
their capitals : congo (brazzaville) and congo (leopoldville)
from his palace, youlou pleaded with the french commander of the
congolese troops to take more vigorous action . " shoot, shoot, "
youlou cried, covering his ears . but his appeal was in vain . although
the french had 3,000 of their own men in the country under a defense
treaty, and air-lifted in another 1,000, orders from paris were only to
protect the presidential palace and french property . on the radio,
youlou announced a government reshuffle, but it was too late . next
morning the mob, now swollen to 10,000, again poured out of the city's
two shantytowns . one man was heard to cry : " i have not worked in
six months . i have not eaten in three days . " finally, resplendent in
a white cassock, youlou appeared on the palace steps, announced that he
had resigned to prevent a bloodbath . with a thunderclap of cheers, the
crowd broke up peacefully, and within hours brazzaville was back to
normal . taking over, the army chose as provisional premier alphonse
massamba-debat, 42, a moderate leftist and former youlou cabinet
minister who fell from favor . in contrast to his catholic predecessor,
massamba-debat is protestant . appointed with him was a seven-man
cabinet of french-trained technicians that failed to include any union
leaders . massamba-debat hinted at prompt elections . as for fulbert
youlou, he had saved his head at least so far, was spirited away to an
army camp for safekeeping . announced massamba-debat : " there will be
no reprisals against monsieur youlou . he is a congolese nobleman . "

algeria ben bellism algeria's premier ahmed ben bella is moving
ever closer to complete one-man rule . last week venerable, ailing
ex-premier ferhat abbas, 63, quit his post as speaker of the assembly
and handed out a 15-page critique of the government . he was chiefly
upset because ben bella keeps ignoring the assembly, even read the
country's new, strongly centralized constitution to a meeting of his
own followers at an algiers movie theater before submitting it to the
deputies . asked abbas : " why should we agree to a constitution that
has been prostituted in a cinema ? " abbas conceded that ben bella's
regime is not going communist but warned that " we do seem to be
heading toward a fascist dictatorship " . though ben bella remarks
acidly that " revolutions are not hade without prisons, " ben bellism
is not fascism . critic abbas was blasted as a " bourgeois spokesman
for privilege " by government-run newspapers and drummed out of the
national liberation front, which he once headed . but he was permitted
to retire quietly to his villa in kouba, outside algiers, thereby
joining the ranks of ben bella's other muffled but unharmed opponents,
such as mohammed boudiaf, who is under house arrest, and ex-premier
benyoussef benkhedda, who has quit politics to resume his career as a

liechtenstein 2-12 the happy have-not at last count, there were 72
princes and princesses of liechtenstein, which is eleven more
highnesses than there are square miles in the minuscule principality .
luckily for the postal system, only a dozen von und zu liechtensteins
actually live in liechtenstein . indeed, it was not until 1937 that a
hereditary ruler actually made his home in the drafty, 13th century
family fortress, whose battlements rise starkly above the capital of
vaduz (pronounced vahdootz) . there last week, amid eulogies and
thunderous renditions of heil liechtenstein, franz josef ii maria aloys
alfred karl johannes heinrich michael georg ignatius benediktus
gerhardus majella, its twelfth reigning prince, observed his 57th
birthday and the 25th anniversary of his accession to the throne . for
fear of overcrowding its pocket paradise, liechtenstein (pop . 18,000)
has granted citizenship to only a dozen foreigners since 1950, and
worries mightily over its rising birth rate . an unsullied blend of
lush meadowland and soaring alpine peaks, the nation nestles so
unobtrusively between austria and switzerland (since 1924 it has shared
currency, customs services and foreign service with the swiss) that
vacationers driving through are often unaware that they are even in
franz josef's fief . this bothers liechtenstein's government not at
all, for, as prime minister alexander frick once observed, the sight of
idle tourists could prove unsettling to the country's hard-working
peasants . salami for rubbernecks . even to shuttle summer traffic
through the country, liechtenstein grudgingly has to double its police
force, which consists normally of 18 men and a dog named rex . the
well-named quick tourist office concentrates its energies on selling
visitors swiss watches, belgian francs and liechtenstein cuckoo clocks,
which are made in west germany . since the country's medieval castles
bear signs saying " no castle visiting, " insistent rubbernecks usually
get to see the salami skin factory or else one of two plants where
strikingly healthy liechtensteiners turn out false teeth and artificial
limbs for world markets . though it boasts one of the world's highest
living standards, german-speaking liechtenstein is in every happy sense
a have-not nation : it has no unemployment, slums, communists, crime,
tv or radio station, airports, divorces or billboards . neutral in both
world wars, it has had no soldiers since 1939, when the only remaining
warrior died in bed . its maximum income tax rate is 10 per cent ;
corporate taxes are so liberal that more than 2,000 foreign firms have
registered headquarters in vaduz . while it is a constitutional
democracy, liechtenstein virtually dispenses with politics . there are
two parties, known as the reds and the blacks, but they are equally
conservative and anti-communist and even have the same motto : faith
in god, prince and fatherland . private leonardo . liechtenstein also
has considerable faith in its wine, a sturdy rose that the government
refuses to export for fear of running dry . an even more jealously
guarded national treasure is franz josef's family art collection (time,
dec . 12, 1960), which consists of 1,500 paintings valued at $150
million . it includes the only leonardo da vinci in private ownership,
a lush portrait of a florentine maiden called the ginevra dei benci, as
well as 27 rubens paintings that are valued at $11 million, and
paintings by van dyck, brueghel, rembrandt and botticelli . the public
is allowed to see only 75 of franz josef's lesser pictures, which are
sandwiched into a modest building in vaduz along with the tourist
office and the national postage-stamp museum . the closest the
liechtenstein family comes to sharing its greatest paintings with the
world is allowing them to appear occasionally on one of the nation's
famed postage stamps . despite postwar losses of vast holdings in
communist czechoslovakia, franz josef ii is ranked among europe's ten
richest men . a grand-nephew of austrian archduke franz ferdinand,
whose assassination at sarajevo ignited world war i, the alert,
easygoing prince is also rated liechtenstein's most popular monarch
since johannes the good, who took the throne in 1858, reigned 71
years, and spent an impressive $18 million of his personal fortune to
build schools and roads in liechtenstein . though no one expected franz
joseph to spend as much, loyal leichtensteiners who crowded into the
palace last week prayed lustily that the prince and his beautiful,
41-year-old wife, princess gina, might reign as long as johannes . "
when the personality cult goes, " murmured one devoted bystander, "
liechtenstein goes too . " longer
than any other european monarch save france's louis xiv, who beat him

india thunder on left & right on the eve of the 16th anniversary
of indian independence, 2,000 demonstrators marched outside parliament
in delhi, waving banners and chanting : " leave the throne, jawaharlal
. " inside the horseshoe-shaped chamber, prime minister jawaharlal
nehru faced the first no-confidence motion in his 16 years in power .
the censure motion was sponsored by nehru's most outspoken political
foe, stooped, acerbic j . b . kripalani, a political independent who
was returned to parliament only two months ago in a surprising
by-election victory, after having been swamped by now discredited
ex-defense minister krishna menon in last year's general election .
kripalani proposed to censure the government among other things, over
official corruption, spiraling food prices and prohibitively high
taxation . though kripalani is pro-western, the censure proposal became
an umbrella for all kinds of other nehru critics, including leftists
angered by nehru's few tentative steps away from nonalignment . one
major leftist target was india's agreement to permit voice of america
broadcasts for three hours daily over a transmitter to be built by the
u.s . in calcutta, and nehru is now trying to back out of it . another
target : the joint air defense exercises that the indian air force
will soon hold with the u.s . and british air commands . in an effort
to silence his leftist critics, nehru has won extensive promises from
russia and its satellites for missiles, fighters, and small arms . top
government officials expect little in substance from soviet aid
promises, but insist that the symbolism of such aid is necessary to
maintain india's image of nonalignment . with nehru's congress party
holding a massive 229-seat plurality in parliament, there is no chance
that the censure motion will be carried . but nehru is plainly worried
over the rising opposition on both the right and the left and over the
by-election trend away from the party in what were once considered
impregnable congress constituencies . he has promised to shake up his
government and to demand the resignation of some cabinet ministers so
that they can work full time on organizational duties to revitalize the
party . nehru's plan is scorned by c . rajagopalachari, 84, leader of
india's small dynamic, free-enterprising swantantra party . "
theatricals do not cure diseases, " says c . r . " the congress party
is sick, and i do not want sick persons in charge of the government . "

south viet nam suicide series it was the most macabre week in
south viet nam's three-month-old religious and political crisis . in
saigon, an 18-year-old girl tried unsuccessfully to cut off her left
hand " as a humble offering to buddha while our religion is in danger .
/ outside the coastal city of hue, a 17-year-old novice buddhist monk
wrapped himself in a kerosene-soaked, six-color buddhist flag, then
struck a match . in the village of ninhhoa, 200 miles north of saigon,
a young buddhist nun sat down in a catholic school playground and set
herself on fire . less than 24 hours later, back in hue, a 71-year-old
monk announced over the tudam pagoda loudspeaker that he was going to
kill himself, then burned himself to death in the pagoda's courtyard .
the quarrel spreads . the
three ritualistic suicides brought to five the number of buddhists who
have turned themselves into human torches in further protest against
the regime of south viet nam's roman catholic president ngo dinh diem .
the government reacted by placing the buddhist strongholds of hue and
nhatrang under virtual martial law . although worried that the burnings
might get out of hand, buddhist leaders defended the suicides as "
noble sacrifices, " were rounding up secular and military support .
leaflets containing western press accounts of the controversy were
being distributed to army units all over the country . soldiers and
peasants began wearing saffron patches the same color as a monk's robes
to indicate their support of the buddhists . in one division mess,
catholic and buddhist officers began eating apart, and at a military
training school, buddhist cadets demanded a chapel similar to the
catholic chapel . buddhist leaders said they would not agree to any
conciliation until the government made several concessions, and
accepted responsibility for the 13 buddhists' being shot down at a
religious demonstration in hue last may . but diem is still hopeful
that they will agree to some discussion and mediation . implied rebuke
. the president's apparent readiness to meet with the buddhists is
bitterly opposed by his sister-in-law, mme . ngo dinh nhu, who has
consistently urged that the buddhist opposition be crushed . " if the
president keeps bowing to the buddhists, " she said, " they will keep
right on taking advantage of this weakness to make new, impossible
demands . they are utterly hypocritical . " with what sounded like a
rebuke to mme . nhu, diem countered : " it is only because some have
contributed, either consciously or unconsciously, to raising doubts
about this government's policy that the solution to the buddhist affair
has been retarded . the policy of utmost conciliation is irreversible .
/ in washington, where henry cabot lodge was getting his final
briefings before leaving to take over as new u.s . ambassador in
saigon, secretary of state dean rusk declared himself " deeply
distressed " over the crisis and the detrimental effect it was having
on the war against the communist viet cong . said rusk : " we hope the
government out there will take a strong lead to bring about a greater
degree of peace and serenity . /

the faith
that lights the fires the readiness of south viet nam's buddhist monks
and nuns to burn themselves to death as a means of protest against the
government both moves and repels the west . on the surface, it seems an
odd phenomenon in a religion generally regarded as passive, gentle and
full of reverence for life . the paradox is caused by the fact that
buddhism, though detached and otherworldly, can at times convulse
itself into action, and that its view of life as transitional can lead
to an almost indifferent embrace of death .self-immolation is not
merely a sit-in carried to oriental extremes . although it has not
occurred often and apparently never before in viet nam the practice is
deeply linked to the basic nature of buddhism, the world's fourth
largest religion . nirvana & dharma . buddhism consists of three
spiritual components, two traditions, and a multiplicity of sects . the
first of the three components, common to all buddhists, is the
legendary life of a handsome indian prince named gautama, who, about
600 years before christ, abandoned his luxurious existence after seeing
four facts of life for the first time : a sick man, an old man, a dead
man and a holy man . he fled to the forest to seek enlightenment, tried
and abandoned the ways of the hermit and the ascetic, and, after
meditating under a sacred bodhi tree for 49 days, at last achieved
buddhahood enlightenment, or nirvana . he spent the rest of his life
walking through india with his disciples, teaching until he died at 80,
leaving a final admonition : " work out your salvation with diligence
. " gautama's teaching, the second chief component of buddhism, is
summed up in the four noble truths : 1) man suffers all his life, and
goes on suffering from one life to the next ; 2) the origin of man's
suffering is craving for pleasure, for possessions, for cessation of
pain ; 3) the cure for craving is the practice of nonattachment to
everything even to the self ; 4) the way to nonattachment is the
eightfold path right views, right intentions, right speech, right
conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right
meditation . the buddha said nothing about god ; no divine judgment,
but an inexorable law of cause and effect called dharma determines
man's weal or woe . third essential component of buddhism is the vast
body of monks and nuns called the sangha . in addition to celibacy and
vegetarian nonviolence, monks practice poverty ; traditionally the
only possessions permitted are robes, a begging bowl for food, a
needle, prayer beads, a razor (to shave the head once a fortnight), and
a filter to remove bugs from the drinking water so as not to kill them
. greater & lesser vehicles . the two great buddhist traditions are
hinayana and mahayana . hinayana, the so-called lesser vehicle, is
generally more austere and uncompromising ; it holds that only monks
and nuns have hope of reaching nirvana . mahayana, the greater vehicle,
offers hope of enlightenment to laymen as well, and stresses the
compassionate concern of the buddha for humanity . the highest mahayana
ideal is the bodhisattva, or enlightened one, who sacrifices himself
for others, and mahayana mythology contains numerous examples of
sacrifices as an act of love as well as a means of liberation . zen
buddhism, one of the subdivisions of mahayana, imported by the japanese
from china, emphasizes a combination of prolonged meditation and shock
to achieve satori, or enlightenment .
viet nam's
buddhism, like china's and japan's, is predominantly mahayana, and the
suicide monks and nuns knew the numerous legends of bodhisattvas'
physical sacrifices, such as that of the holy man who gave his body to
a famished tigress to keep her from eating her cubs . some mahayana
monks still aid their liberation from the body by burning the fingers
off their left hands, and in the 6th century before gasoline monks who
decided to immolate themselves completely would eat waxy and fatty
foods for a couple of years so they would burn better . theoretically
buddhism does not permit suicide, and the word is carefully avoided in
favor of " sacrifice . " one of gautama's testaments, the lotus sutra,
as interpreted by monks in saigon, calls for all buddhists to sacrifice
themselves if their religion is in danger . one early buddhist martyr,
it is said, took his life by first punching his body full of holes and
sealing them with oil, then setting fire to himself . feasts & magic .
the grass-roots mahayana buddhism in the viet nam villages is a long
way from such grim practices . it usually takes the form of the
easygoing amidism, in which a paradise called " pure land " awaits the
intense faithful who repeats a simple prayer . it is strongly
influenced by the magical practices of corrupted taoism, imported from
china around the 7th century, and by confucianism, which stresses
ethical behavior . confucius emphasized family obligations, evident
still in viet nam's ancestor worship and cult of the dead . the 15th
day of the seventh month is set aside annually for the departed ; the
shades swoop down upon the living, who do their best to placate them
with a sumptuous feast . dressed in their best black silk and carrying
burning joss sticks, the women recite invitations to their dead
ancestors to partake of roast pig's head and sticks of sugar cane,
peanuts and white rice . as offerings to less trencher-minded spirits,
they burn paper imitations of currency and clothes . crusader & yogi .
in many western eyes, buddhism is socially useless . it has only a
limited tradition of good works ; the chief duty of monks and nuns is
contemplation . in the lotus and the robot, arthur koestler says of
oriental mysticism in general : " the mesianic arrogance of the
christian crusader is matched by the yogi's arrogant attitude of
detachment towards human suffering . " actually, buddhists are quite
capable of the crusading spirit . in ceylon during the 2nd century
b.c., a king led his army against indian invaders with a relic of
buddha in his spear . in viet nam and elsewhere, buddhists often took
an active part in fighting against colonial powers . during the korean
war, at least some buddhists were preaching that " to wipe out the
american imperialist demons is not only blameless but meritorious . "
ignoring the chinese communists' cruel persecution of buddhism in
tibet, some buddhists reason (as one scholar puts it) that when the
marxists' material needs are satisfied, they will " need something
spiritual above and beyond, " and that buddhism will be able to supply
it . it is this sort of self-delusion existing alongside buddhism's
nobility of spirit that makes the eightfold path so full of pitfalls .

great britain omen on avon what with alarming figures from the
national opinion poll and the confessions of christine, top tories were
braced for bad news from last week's by-election to fill john profumo's
vacant seat at stratford-upon-avon, a true-blue tory constituency . the
news was bad all right, though hardly disastrous . rightwing
conservative angus maude won with 15,846 votes, but the party's margin
dropped from its 1959 peak of 14,129 to a mere 3,470 . the gains,
however, did not go to the labor opposition, which has always run a
poor second in stratford ; tories either stayed away from the polls or
voted liberal . while labor candidate andrew faulds got 12,376 votes,
only 359 more than the laborite received at the last election, derick
mirfin, the first liberal candidate to contest stratford in 13 years,
walked off with 7,622, close to half the total that was cast for tory
maude, although the liberals had virtually no political machine working
for them . many tories who voted liberal out of dissatisfaction with
the government will undoubtedly return to the fold at the next general
election . nonetheless, the drop in tory strength in a tory stronghold
was a sobering confirmation that the party will have a rough time in
the national elections, which, as a result, will probably not be held
until spring .

south viet nam the crackdown over and
over, the desperate voice shouted into the telephone : " they are
breaking into xa loi pagoda . they are breaking into xa loi pagoda . "
in the background, gunfire mingled with the confused screams of
buddhist monks and nuns and the clanging alarm of the huge brass gong
that hangs in the bell tower of saigon's largest pagoda . suddenly the
phone connection from the temple went dead . it was 12 : 20 a.m .
using their rifle butts as clubs, squads of tough, riottrained "
special forces " smashed into the pagoda, battering a path through a
small guard of young buddhist monks . the troopers had a list, and each
monk on the list was considered to be a " communist in disguise . " on
the temple's second floor, one monk tried to resist and was thrown
bodily from a balcony to the court-yard 20 ft . below . other monks and
nuns were routed from behind a flimsy barricade of wooden benches and
forced outside by tear gas and gunshots . sacking the pagoda's main
altar, the raiders carted away the charred heart of buddhist martyr
thich quang duc, who last june was the first of five buddhists to burn
himself to death in protest against the diem government's antibuddhist
drive . but the buddhists managed to spirit out of the building the
receptacle holding quang duc's ashes . " the ashes are holy, " said one
monk . " we would give 15 lives to defend them . " two other monks
escaped over the back wall of xa loi (pronounced sah loy) into the
grounds of the adjoining u.s . aid mission, where they were given
temporary sanctuary . to the diem government, the crackdown obviously
seemed necessary to protect the regime and enforce the law of the land
against buddhist defiance . but it was brutal, nonetheless, and it
aroused a strong new wave of sympathy for the buddhists . it also put
u.s . policy in south viet nam, which involves the lives and safety of
14,000 u.s . troops, into an agonizing dilemma . while often unhappy
with diem, the u.s . has proceeded on the assumption that it was safer
to stick with him than risk the chaos that might surround a switch to a
new, unknown and unpredictable regime . but by his move against the
buddhist monks, who have the growing support of the country's vast
buddhist majority, roman catholic diem may finally have shattered his
own political usefulness . he also opened up the possibilities of
coups, counter-coups, and even civil war from all of which only the
communist viet cong could benefit . boola, boola . until last week,
prodded by the u.s., diem had displayed an apparent willingness to
conciliate the buddhists . feeling betrayed by diem's crackdown, one
ranking u.s . embassy officer said : " all the time they've been
preaching conciliation to us, they've evidently been planning just the
opposite . " the buddhist crisis had begun as a religious one, but
gradually turned into a major political conflict . the buddhists are
far from passive martyrs . their religious and social demands a fairly
modest package demanding full equality with the country's roman
catholics had never sounded crucial, especially since even diem's worst
enemies could not point to any real anti-buddhist discrimination or
persecution . but when government troops stupidly killed 13 buddhists
in a demonstration in hue (pronounced whey) four months ago, the
buddhists made the clearly political demand that the government accept
/ responsibility " for the incident . since then, the buddhists have
developed into a serious opposition movement . pagodas, sporting
protest signs in vietnamese and english, became command posts where
duplicating machines ground out hundreds of thousands of messages, and
the sound of typewriters and telephones blended with the boom of temple
gongs . appeals for aid were broadcast to president kennedy, pope paul
vi, and u.n . secretary-general u thant . at a grisly, well-organized
press conference in saigon, buddhist leaders introduced a tiny,
withered buddhist nun as a candidate for self-immolation in protest
against the diem government . when one buddhist spokesman who had
studied at yale wanted to pass out the latest communiques from the
pagoda, he would stroll up to a yale-educated u.s . newsman and say :
/ boola, boola . /
in the early phases of the quarrel, diem
probably could and should have conciliated the buddhists . but he
vacillated . his brother and sister-in-law, ngo dinh nhu and mme . nhu,
insisted that unless the buddhists were crushed, there would be a coup
threatening the very existence of the family's rule . mme . nhu's fiery
philippics lent impetus to the buddhist movement just as it appeared to
be flagging . by last week, after three buddhist suicides spurred new
protest demonstrations throughout the country, it was clearly too late
for conciliation . even if diem had wanted it, the buddhist leaders
themselves no longer wanted it ; they were plainly determined to press
their advantage . and so the government evidently yielded to nhu's
get-tough policy . rope trick . the crackdown in saigon was duplicated
all over south viet nam, and more than 1,000 people were imprisoned .
in the buddhist stronghold of hue, the approach of government troops
was signaled by the beating of temple drums and the clashing of cymbals
calling for help . beating pots and pans to rouse their neighbors, the
angry populace poured from homes and raced to defend the city's temples
. at tu dam pagoda, monks tried to turn the coffin of a priest who had
burned himself alive in the buddhist suicide protest wave . but
government soldiers, firing m1 rifles as they advanced, overran the
temple, snatched the smoldering coffin away, and smashed a statue of
gautama buddha . from the temple's treasury they took an estimated
$30,000 and left the pagoda a gutted ruin . near hue's dieu de pagoda,
the government forces met their first determined resistance . as troops
tried to stretch a barbed-wire barricade across the bridge leading to
the temple, a mob tore it down with bare hands . with fists, rocks and
sharpened sticks, the crowd fought the heavily armed troops for the
bridge . tear-gas grenades thrown by the soldiers were caught and
thrown right back at them . when troops tried to clear a way through
the bridge defenders with their rifle butts, the crowd tore the weapons
from their hands and jabbed the soldiers in the groin . after a
five-hour pitched battle, the government finally won control of the
bridge at daybreak by driving armored cars through the screaming,
spitting, swearing mob . the defense of the bridge and the temple cost
the townspeople an estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded . ten truckloads
of bridge defenders were carted away to jail, many streaming blood, and
an estimated 500 people were arrested throughout the city, including 17
of the 47 hue university professors who had resigned earlier in the
week in protest against the firing of the school's rector, a catholic
priest and an opponent of diem's brother, archbishop ngo dinh thuc .
though a 24-hour curfew was clamped on hue, the city's residents were
still defiant . one buddhist monk fled through the streets hotly
pursued by three government troopers . the priest raced down an alley
at whose entrance sat an aged vietnamese woman . as the soldiers turned
into the alley, the woman pulled tightly on a rope stretched across the
street, bringing all three soldiers tumbling down . then she scuttled
away to safety . article 44 . at 6 a.m., radio saigon crackled to life
and president diem came on the air . " under article 44 of the
constitution, " he said, " i declare a state of siege throughout the
national territory . i confer upon the army of the republic of viet nam
the responsibility to restore security and public order so that the
state may be protected, communism defeated, freedom secured, and
democracy achieved . " under the martial law proclamation, the army was
given blanket search-and-arrest powers and empowered to forbid all
public gatherings, restrict press freedom, and prohibit the circulation
of all " printed material and other documents harmful to public order
and security . " in saigon the army imposed a tight 9 p.m.-to-5 a.m .
curfew . carrying automatic weapons and rifles with fixed bayonets,
troops in full camouflage battle dress guarded every major bridge and
intersection . tight censorship was clamped on all outgoing news, and
reporters were forced to give their stories to travelers flying to
neighboring countries or to fly out themselves with their copy .
telephone service in the homes and offices of all u.s . military and
embassy personnel was cut off .
the political
repercussions began at once . protesting the government's action,
foreign minister vu van mau quit his post, shaved his head and
announced that he would go to india to become a contemplative buddhist
monk . south viet nam's ambassador to washington, tran van chuong, who
is mme . nhu's father, also quit, with a sharp denunciation of his
daughter's policies and of the diem government for " copying the
tactics of totalitarian regimes . " as long as diem stays in power, he
added, there is " not one chance of winning the war against the
communists .
in saigon more than 500
university of saigon medical students boycotted classes and held
turbulent anti-government meetings . when a professor tried to rip down
a pro-buddhist poster, he was stoned by students . throughout the city,
martial law posters were surreptitiously defaced or torn away .
students jeered at soldiers patrolling the streets : " why don't you
go back to fighting the viet cong ? " the government retaliated
against student unrest by closing all saigon's schools . the ugly
american . the crackdown in south viet nam caused consternation in
washington . in a blunt condemnation the state department said that
saigon's strong-arm tactics represented " a direct violation by the
vietnamese government of assurances that it was pursuing a policy of
reconciliation toward the buddhists . the u.s . deplores repressive
actions of this nature . " the move against the buddhists was obviously
timed to be over and done with before u.s . ambassador henry cabot
lodge arrived in saigon . when it happened, lodge was in japan . on the
way out from san francisco by commercial jet, he had found himself
across the aisle from novelist eugene burdick, co-author of the ugly
american, and that self-appointed expert on u.s . errors in the far
east offered the ambassador a half-hour briefing, to which lodge
listened diplomatically . the gist : don't rely on embassy officers,
consult seasoned newsmen, beware of communications blocks in the
embassy, get fighter cover for those combat helicopters . on orders
from president kennedy, lodge cut short his stay in japan, and by
hastily commandeered u.s . air force dc-6 proceeded at once to saigon,
where he was met by a vietnamese protocol officer, embassy officials
and general paul harkins, commander of the u.s . troops in south viet
nam . as if to dramatize u.s . disapproval of the government action,
lodge went to the u.s . aid mission building to talk to the two monks
who had been given sanctuary . ignoring demands that the monks be
turned over to vietnamese authorities, lodge ordered the u.s . staff to
get some vegetables for the vegetarian priests . anti, anti, anti .
what to do next was a question thickly clouded for both lodge and
washington by confusion over precisely who was in control of the
situation in south viet nam . diem still seemed in complete charge and
in a cable to the new york herald tribune's marguerite higgins he
declared, " i trust in the army and in fact i maintain control over the
situation . " but it looked increasingly likely that the key figure
behind the government's move had been brother nhu, head of the
10,000-strong special forces and secret police . for weeks there had
been hints that he might try a coup of his own supposedly to forestall
the anti-diem coup that he kept predicting unless the buddhists were put
down . any change in government policy, he had warned, would be "
anti-buddhist, anti-american, anti-weakness . /
the crackdown it was nhu's
special forces that sacked the pagodas ; regular army troops were only
called in after the job was done to help keep order . theoretically,
under the martial law proclamation, it is now the army that runs the
country, and, again theoretically, diem placed top authority in major
general tran van don, 46, a highly respected, onetime corps commander
who has had great military success against the viet cong . but don may
merely be a figurehead hostile to the government, he was pulled out of
his field command last december and kicked upstairs to a staff job,
where he would have no troops at his disposal in case the thought of a
coup ever crossed his mind . diem and nhu evidently intended to vest
real military power in another, very different officer, whose loyalty
the ngo family can count on, colonel le quant tung, commander under nhu
of the special forces . a devout catholic, tung comes from central viet
nam, birthplace of the ngo family, apparently has no political
ambitions, and was once a top official in nhu's secret organization,
the can lao party . as long as a month ago, large units of special
forces were moved into saigon under colonel tung's command . the big
question is whether tung can keep control and whether the regular army
will go along or will turn against the regime . the course of events .
after nine years of absolute power, the ngo family had taken a
considerable risk in letting so much authority slip from its hands
under the martial law proclamation . taking over the functioning of all
government ministries, the army for the first time has a viable power
structure of its own . it may well stay loyal as long as diem remains
in the presidential palace, but nhu is vastly unpopular with most of
the military commanders except tung . the army immediately tried to
dissociate itself from the buddhist crackdown . all official bulletins
from the army-controlled government information center pointedly
mentioned that nhu's special forces, and not the army, had wrecked the
pagodas . but having discovered that an opportunity for power now
exists outside the ngo family, various military factions may well begin
to jockey for sole authority . at week's end, according to one report,
this fear was realized at the small town of my tho, just south of
saigon, where buddhist and catholic troops turned on each other . in
the field, action against the viet cong has come to a virtual
standstill . " this wrecks the army's efforts against the reds, " said
a senior u.s . intelligence officer . " they're too busy enforcing
curfews to fight . how the reds must be loving this . " more than ever,
diem's government or any other in south viet nam depends on u.s .
backing . yet even if washington should officially decide that diem has
become a liability in the fight against the viet cong, the u.s . will
not support a change in government while the powers in saigon are still
settling accounts among themselves . said one washington official : "
when the rumbling of opposition starts within a regime of this sort,
you can't  tell where events are going to take it . /

burma the way to socialism & havoc while the
world's attention was focused on south viet nam, another southeast
asian nation was quietly going from bad to disastrous . burma's
business is virtually at a standstill, credit is nonexistent, foreign
investment has vanished all because dictator ne win insists on instant,
total socialism . burma has 1,370 miles of mountainous border with red
china, and, says an eastern european diplomat, " practicing socialism
in such proximity to communism is like walking a tightrope in a typhoon
. " in foreign affairs, ne win has not yet been blown off the
tightrope, has managed to maintain what passes for neutrality : mildy
hostile toward the u.s., friendly toward china (without, however,
endorsing peking's attack against india), friendlier toward moscow and,
of course, accepting aid from all three . but domestically, the typhoon
is causing havoc . nationalization . energetic dictator ne win, who is
part-chinese, in 1958 pressured parliament into making him premier in
place of dreamy, inefficient but popular u nu . after ruling for 17
months, ne win permitted national elections . u nu won an easy victory
and proved even more ineffectual than before . in march 1962, ne win
jailed u nu and most of his cabinet, abolished parliament, imposed
censorship, and began to rule through a 17-man revolutionary council of
army officers . leaving nothing to chance, ne win named himself leader
of the council, president of burma, minister for defense, finance and
revenue, and chief of the military tribunals that have replaced burma's
graft-ridden judiciary . devout buddhist u nu is still under house
arrest and passes the time in meditation and, presumably, in pursuit of
his special obsession astrology . ne win also produced a vague document
called " the burmese way to socialism " and nationalized industry,
collectivized agriculture, and took complete control of foreign trade .
one saturday afternoon, he grabbed the nation's 24 foreign and domestic
banks . britain's prestigious lloyd's bank was renamed people's bank no
. 19, and the same fate befell two red chinese banks, putting a crimp
in rangoon's communist propaganda machine . industrial production has
fallen 40 per cent in three months and urban unemployment has soared .
the few remaining private companies are clamoring for nationalization,
hoping to get a better break on raw material allocations and some
protection against strikes . because there are too few trained
administrators to run any more enterprises, ne win last week was forced
to refuse all future nationalization petitions . although in the past
the government encouraged workers to strike against private employers
in state-run businesses, strikes are considered unpatriotic ne win last
week urged labor to moderate its wage demands, in a belated attempt to
pacify businessmen . insurrection . while crippling the economy, ne win
has been striving for a measure of national unity . his fairly
competent army of 50,000 men controls the main cities and about 50 per
cent of the texas-sized nation . about 35 per cent of the area is no
man's land, and the remaining 15 per cent is divided among a variety of
insurgents, ranging from tribal groups, such as the shans, karens and
kachins, to two major bands of communist insurgents, 1) the trotskyite
red flag movement, and 2) the larger white flag communists, who are
fragmented into stalinist and revisionist wings . still another
insurgent outfit is composed of several hundred chinese nationalist
soldiers who fled their homeland years ago and have since operated as
bandits .
in vain, previous burmese governments
have offered amnesties to the rebels . ne win went farther : he
promised a safe-conduct to rebel leaders for discussions in rangoon .
red flag leader thakin soe accepted . he was picked up by a river
gunboat, taken to a government airfield and flown to rangoon, where he
promptly demanded 1) a nationwide cease-fire, 2) withdrawal of burmese
troops from vital red flag areas, and 3) a meeting of all political
factions legal and illegal to form a new government . taken aback by
these demands, ne win denounced thakin soe as " insincere " and gave
him seven days' immunity to get back to the safety of his jungle
hideouts . opposition . though ne win is conceded to be honest and
hard-working, easygoing burmese long for the good old good-for-nothing
government of u nu, whose photo is still hawked on the streets and
outsells that of ne win by a wide margin . one opposition leader, u ba
swe, called on ne win " to retreat from the brink of disaster for the
sake of the nation, " and the ex-ambassador to the u.s., u win,
demanded
a return to parliamentary democracy . both were packed off to "
protective custody, " along with nine other dissenters from instant
socialism . nervous ne win frequently carries a pistol, and
anti-aircraft guns stand ready at government house . yet, even though
opposition to his regime is massive throughout the country, he still
has the bulk of the army with him . and, as is his habit when he
encounters obstacles, ne win changed course slightly . he temporarily
rescinded controls on rice to placate farmers, offered to build a new
student union at the university of rangoon (he had blown up the old one
after a student riot in july 1962), and called a conference of his
administrators to " improve and review " all measures enacted by the
government . presumably to show he is not a total tyrant, ne win
released three former cabinet ministers (but not ex-premier u nu) from
house arrest . unless the army stages a coup, ne win may muddle along
indefinitely . " it's not the burmese way to man the barricades, "
explained a rangoon educator . " given our plentiful food supplies and
the passivity of the people, it's possible for someone to misrule burma
for perhaps a decade before incurring true wrath . /

india the case of nehru's dog in india, cried a
socialist politician last week, 270 million people exist on 4 #$ a day,
while it takes 63 #$ daily to feed jawaharlal nehru's dog . not so,
retorted nehru : daily subsistence for 70 per cent of the population
is all of 20 #$ . (he did not deny his canine food costs.) the
accusation, and the prime minister's reply, were fair samples of the
acrimonious personal attack on nehru
last week during the first censure motion against the government in
india's 16 years of independence . with a 229-seat plurality, nehru's
congress party was in no danger . nevertheless, the debate, which
followed three shattering by-election defeats for the government,
vented indians' wide and rising dissatisfaction with the congress party
policies that led to the nation's humiliating defeats by the chinese
last october . the attack on the government was led by j . b .
kripalani, longtime friend of nehru and onetime president of his
congress party, who was elected to parliament recently as an
independent . whole skins . " this government has failed in its
domestic
policy, " declared kripalani . it " has failed in its foreign policy,
and it has failed in its economic policy . the people feel depressed
and frustrated, and believe the country has slid back during the past
15 years . " the government's longtime policy of " nonalignment, "
kripalani argued, no longer fits " national needs . " said he : " you
cannot coexist with someone who does not believe in coexistence . we
are at war with china . " the government's case was not notably helped
by krishna menon, who, in his first major speech in parliament since he
was sacked as defense minister last winter, made the curiously
unguarded
admission that the government's nonalignment policy was based,
not on principle, but merely on " our desire to keep our skins whole
and entire . " the communists, who refused to associate themselves with
the no-confidence motion but made the most of it anyway, bitterly
condemned the airtraining exercises that are to be held jointly with
the u.s . and britain in india, probably in november . the communists
aso baited food minister s . k . patil for his " annual pilgrimage to
america to beg for more food . " retorted patil : " moscow is a
delightful city . i wish i could go there all the time . but there are
no surpluses of food in russia . " departing ministers . nehru's
rebuttal was a rambling, schoolmasterly homily on india's " vision of
the future " and the need for hard work ; while he spoke, at least two
members of his party slumbered in their seats . the censure motion was
defeated 346-61, with the communists abstaining . the heat of the
attack on the once-sacrosanct nehru dismayed many congress party
officials, and led to the resignation of six cabinet ministers, who
announced that they would concentrate on rejuvenating the party . the
departing ministers were the strongest men on nehru's team, although
some were in political trouble . among them were two strong
pro-westerners, food minister patil and finance minister morarji desai,
widely criticized for food shortages and high prices, as well as home
minister lal bahadur shastri, nehru's likeliest successor . nehru's
daughter, indira gandhi, who is herself a potential candidate to
succeed nehru, insisted that india's mood of unrest is a sign of "
progress . " impatiently tapping a pink-toed, sandaled foot, mrs .
gandhi explained : " when your children reach their teens, they
suddenly feel their parents are all wrong . india is in that stage now,
for it's just 16 years old . everybody grumbles about taxes . but you
can see the number of shops increasing, more people going to the

communists a fan of henry ford's from his
own crimean
estate with its now-famed badminton court and glass-enclosed swimming
pool, nikita khrushchev last week traveled to marshal tito's wonderland
in yugoslavia . from a state dinner at belgrade's white palace,
khrushchev went on an adriatic cruise aboard tito's yacht galeb
(seagull), spent three days at tito's island retreat of brioni, then to
tito's 400-year-old castle in the dinaric alps, next to tito's summer
residence at brda and, finally, to tito's croatian hunting lodge at
belje . to the chinese, who have long complained that khrushchev has
gone over to the enemy camp both ideologically and in his personal
tastes, all this must have seemed infuriating particularly since host
tito is their ideological archenemy, the " revisionist " who first
broke with stalin and established a more or less independent brand of
marxism . at the height of his quarrel with peking, and with a certain
unrest among the soviet satellites, khrushchev was clearly drawing
closer to tito, even hinted that yugoslavia might be allowed to
participate in comecon, the creaky eastern common market . tito in turn
seemed determined to suggest that, even if moscow accepts him
wholeheartedly as a comrade, he retain his independence ; in doing so
he presumably had an eye on washington, where congress this week
considers whether to restore the previously canceled
most-favored-nation
rating for yugoslav exports to the u.s . cracked a yugoslav official :
/ we didn't sign a treaty with khrushchev as you americans did . we
didn't even play badminton with him . " mama's children . the two
leaders did just about everything else, as they ranged the country from
quake-shattered skoplje to wild montenegro, where after a picnic the
mountainfolk broke into the kolo, a fiery, footstamping circle dance .
khrushchev and his stolid wife nina, and tito and his statuesque spouse
jovanka, broke into the ring, locking arms and swirling around with the
pretty girls and peasants . the most instructive part of the visit came
at the rakovica auto plant outside belgrade . in a discussion with the
workers, khrushchev seemed fascinated by the yugoslav factory system of
decentralized, locally administered socialism through workers' councils
elected by the employees and empowered to fire or reverse the decisions
of the plant manager . the system has long been denounced by red
chinese ideologues, and by russia since yugoslavia was kicked out of
the comintern in 1948 . even khrushchev once sneered, " the workers'
councils are only good when they are propped up by american grain and
meat . " reversing himself, khrushchev called the councils a /
progressive development " and said russia was facing the question of "
whether or not conditions are ripe for the democratization of
management . unless there is a force of public opinion our managers
tend to become autocrats . of course, your system may not be totally in
line with the leninist principle of unified leadership . don't you ever
have trouble between workers and directors ? " assured that
disagreements were always worked out, khrushchev shook his head
skeptically and said, " you're a little boastful but, of course, mama
always says her children are the most beautiful . you've got your
shortcomings but then so do we . " plaster bust . warming up,
khrushchev demanded : " what is the most important problem now ? it
is to beat capitalism . the one who creates the most through mass
production will win . henry ford has shown us how to do it . " he
added, " after the revolution, we sent a delegation to henry ford and
asked him to help us build a factory that would produce 30,000 cars a
year . ford told us that a factory making only 30,000 would not work .
the car would be too expensive . he said we should come back when we
were ready to produce 120,000 a year . " to illustrate the lessons of
productivity, khrushchev even rambled off into biblical history,
inaccurately recalling that christ had fed 40,000 persons with a single
loaf of bread . with his usual heavy-footed humor he added, " but no
one knows if all got enough to eat . if they had, they would not have
left palestine . " as for the chinese : " they say that their country
has to rely on its own resources . it is true and it is not true . if
you lock yourself within your own frontiers, you lose your economic
potential . they say they are going to rely on their own resources, and
then they write to us for credits . " the entranced workers at rakovica
responded to all this by handing khrushchev a present he must have long
wanted and needed : a plaster bust of lenin . presumably none of henry
ford was available .

stalinsville on the styx private vasily terkin was the eternal sad
sacha, and his fictional military exploits poked sly fun at soviet
officerdom throughout world war ii . russians complained mightily when
his creator, poet aleksandr trifonovich tvardovsky, failed to bring him
home from the wars . last week, to their delight, vasily was back with
a difference . the soldier's return was chronicled in a subtle, stylish
new poem by tvardovsky that was spread across two pages of izvestia
under a warmly approving introduction by editor aleksei adzhubei,
khrushchev's son-in-law . in stalin's day, for all his buffoonery,
terkin ultimately had to symbolize " the ideal soviet soldier " ; in
his latest adventure, he is a cockily irreverent figure who gets killed
in battle and goes to a " nether world " that turns out to be a sort of
stalinsville on the styx . hell, terkin finds, is like the moscow
subway, " only lower . " it is run by a pampered army of bureaucrats,
who spend their days playing dominoes and yelling at the inmates to
keep out of their way . a model of communist planning, the nether world
has menus but no food, steam baths without steam, hotels without beds .
there is even a magazine editor who " sweats all over " as he " puts in
quotes and takes them out again and reads each page from top to bottom
and from bottom to top . " says one big brotherly ghost : " you don't
have to talk, you don't have to think at all . " terkin finally manages
to escape and wakes up in a hospital on earth, where doctors
confidently predict that he will live to be 100 . the moral of terkin's
trip, tvardovsky suggests, is that all russians share the blame for
stalin because they resigned themselves to his excesses instead of
resisting them . however, the poet also urges russians to stop harping
on stalinism, which has been khrushchev's line of late . terkin's
resurrection was a sign that khrushchev had decided to soften a
campaign against controversial writing that has been going on since
december . in fact, editor adzhubei noted
reassuringly, nikita liked the poem and laughed loudly when it was read
to him before publication .

south africa escape artists while radios blared the descriptions
of the fugitives, thousands of south african police manned roadblocks,
searched white homes and black townships all over the country . their
elusive quarry, honored by the biggest reward ($5,600) ever posted in
south africa : four prisoners who had staged a 1 a.m . walk-away from
johannesburg's central police headquarters . the leader of the
fugitives was arthur goldreich, at 33 one of the country's most
successful artists, and as of last week one of its more successful
escape artists as well . raid on rivonia . bespectacled and slightly
stooped, with a black beard (when last seen), goldreich won south
africa's 1955 best young painter award for his figures in black and
white, designed sets and costumes for king kong, the famed south
african musical . to prime minister hendrik verwoerd's regime, he was a
key suspect in the clandestine operations of the anti-apartheid
underground . last month police descended on the artist's swank home in
the johannesburg suburb of rivonia, arrested goldreich, his wife hazel,
four other white men, and a dozen nonwhites .
like goldreich, the other
arrested whites were also prominent in south africa's intellectual
community : lawyer robert hepple ; dr . hilliard festenstein, a noted
medical researcher ; engineer dennis goldberg ; architect lionel
bernstein . among the nonwhites seized was walter sisulu, one-time
secretary-general of the banned african national congress and one of
the country's most wanted men . goldreich was jailed under a recent law
by which police can hold a suspect for 90 days without charge . (when
the 90-day term comes to an end, some prisoners are being dutifully
released, allowed to walk 100 yards, then rearrested for another
three-month stretch.) a month after his arrest, goldreich apparently
got hold of cellblock keys, possibly with inside help, and freed three
fellow prisoners two anti-apartheid asians, and a jewish lawyer, harold
wolpe, longtime defender of imprisoned leftists.
dark mutterings . the
case called attention to the fact that among south african whites who
oppose verwoerd's apartheid, perhaps the most zealous are jews . the
bulk of south africa's 116,000 jews tacitly condone apartheid, the
jewish board of deputies has always been careful not to attack it, and
some of the wealthiest jews contribute to verwoerd's national party .
but to thousands of others, especially the younger, university-educated
group, apartheid smells too much like nazism . in the 1961 general
election, jews voted massively against the national party, and the lone
anti-apartheid crusader in the 160-member assembly today is the pert,
irrespressible jewish wife of a johannesburg physician, mrs . helen
suzman . despite such opposition and verwoerd's own pro-nazi past, jews
have so far been unmolested by the regime . the goldreich escape,
however, touched off ominous rumblings . last week when criminal
investigation chief reinier j . van den bergh mentioned the rivonia
raid in a speech, a voice from the audience cried : " jews ! " van
den bergh allowed that foes of apartheid might be " instruments of jews

norway end of an
institution interrupted only by the nazi occupation, norway's labor
party had been in power for 28 years, longer than any other democratic
party in europe . last week it was out . at the root of its downfall
was a long-developing schism between the party's moderate, pro-west
majority and its far-left fringe, which demands norway's withdrawal
from nato.two years ago, some leftist laborites bolted, formed a
splinter " socialist people's party, " and managed to win two
parliamentary seats on the 1961 election . partly as a result of the
defection, premier einar gerhardsen's government lost its majority in
the storting (parliament), found itself deadlocked, 74 seats to 74
seats, with the opposition coalition . the balance of power was held by
two splinter leftists . reluctantly, gerhardsen accepted their support
to stay in office . what broke up the uneasy coalition and brought on
norway's first government crisis in a generation was a tragic scandal
in the state-run coal mines . in recent years, four disastrous
explosions and several lesser accidents have plagued the mines, at a
cost of 74 lives . several weeks ago, an investigating commission
charged official negligence . last week, after four days of angry
debate, the two splinter socialists joined with the opposition in a
no-confidence vote against the government . one of the leftists, finn
gustavsen, explained that the s.p.p . toppled gerhardsen because " he
has no longer any contact with the working class . " there was spite
involved, too ; gerhardsen recently appointed that old communist
target, ex-u.n . secretary-general trygve lie, a staunch laborite, to
the post of minister of industry . as the unchallenged leader of his
party for two decades, gerhardsen, 66, had become a national
institution, was so scrupulous that he insisted on buying his own
postage stamps for personal letters . he ran a part-free, largely
controlled economy, was staunchly pro-west and led norway into nato .
his successor was expected to be blond, husky conservative floor leader
john lyng, 58, attorney and brilliant prosecutor of norway's nazi war
criminals . conservative lyng's four-party coalition consists chiefly
of farmers, merchants and industrialists, whose economic views are less
statist than the laborites' ; but lyng will hardly try to alter
norway's deeply ingrained welfare society and certainly not its nato
policies . with the two maverick leftists still holding the balance of
power, he knows that he will be lucky to survive until the next
election in 1965 .

great britain bobbies in trouble when constabulary
duty's to be done, the policeman's lot is not a happy one . the pirates
of penzance to the u.s . tourist driving on the right but wrong side of
the road, or hopelessly demanding a drink at midnight, the london
police seem paragons of patience . whether breaking up a race riot or
gingerly plucking anti-nuclear squatters from the pavement, the brawny,
pink-cheeked bobby almost never resorts to the panicky brutality of the
french flic or the officious zeal of the german polizist . britain's
police, armed only with a night stick, still believe in pounding a beat
. its streets and parks after dark are among the world's safest ; and
while an english householder is away on vacation, likely as not the
bobbies will keep an eye on his front door . but in recent years, and
particularly since the profumo-keeler-ward scandals, britons have come
to suspect that their police are not only markedly less proficient at
keeping the queen's peace than of old, but may also have become less
scrupulous in upholding the traditionally high standards of british
justice . smarter crooks . when it comes to solving crime, it is still
elementary to call in scotland yard . last week, led by such wise old
bluebottles as commander george hatherill, 65, the yard's dean of
sleuths, who speaks eight languages and has solved 17 murders, yard men
investigating the great buckinghamshire train robbery succeeded in
rounding up nine suspects, recovered $761,367 of the $7,000,000 loot .
also on hand were ernest millen, boss of the flying squad, alias the
heavy mob, whose 100-odd sleuths know more about the underworld than
dante ; and the terrible twins, top detectives tom butler and peter
vibart, who have cracked many a big case together . yet so far at
least, the gang's ringleaders were still at large . even without such
humiliations at the hands of master crooks, the lot of britain's 76,530
policemen is an increasingly unhappy one . the nation's police forces
are critically undermanned (authorized strength : 82,313), sadly
underpaid (sergeant's pay averages $3,000 a year) and, in many critics'
eyes, undereducated . in recent years, police recruits have included
not a single university graduate ; only about 10 per call new bobbies
have the equivalent of a high school diploma . british criminals, by
contrast, are becoming more imaginative and technically proficient
every year . as for scotland yard, even its staunchest admirers admit
that the legend tends to overshadow performance . of a record number of
crimes reported in london last year, fewer than 25 per cent were solved
; police have recovered none of the 700,000 stolen in four major
robberies from one bank during the past three years .
in the woodshed . as for the profumo
case, though an official inquiry into its security aspects is nearly
complete, the government has given little assurance that it will lessen
what the economist recently called " the already cumbrous weight of
suspicion that there is something nasty in the woodshed . " last week
the labor party's " shadow " foreign secretary, patrick gordon walker,
called for a royal commission to investigate the roles played
throughout by the government, judiciary and police . among other hints
of nastiness in the woodshed, or the police station, britons were
perturbed by recent charges that scotland yard had browbeaten a
convicted prostitute into testifying against ward (she later recanted),
and by speculation that police deliberately failed to produce a defense
witness at the trial of " lucky " gordon, the jamaican singer who was
imprisoned on charges of beating christine keeler, and later
mysteriously freed . since there is no watertight separation of
executive, judicial and legislative powers in britain's unwritten
constitution, the disquieting implication to many britons was that, in
its embarrassment over the profumo scandal, the government had exerted
extraordinary pressure to put ward behind bars . if such suspicions are
unfair, there was little likelihood that they would ever be fully
investigated, let alone refuted . danger to democracy .e many other
legacies of 19th century britain, the law enforcement system seems
almost to have been designed not to work . to some extent, it was . sir
robert peel, who in 1829 organized the first modern force (and gave the
bobbies his name), admitted to grave misgivings that it might be used
as an instrument of tyranny . unlike a soldier or civil servant, the
british policeman is not a " servant of the crown " but has the
ambiguous legal status of a uniformed civilian who is merely paid to do
what every citizen should do on his own . even to this day, many
britons believe that a strong, unified police force could lead to a
police state . as a result, they have 158 separate local forces whose
chief constables are accountable only to themselves . when a royal
commission in 1962 recommended continuation of this system, commission
member a . l . goodhart an eminent u.s . jurist who was then master of
oxford's university college objected that a single, centrally
controlled police network would be infinitely more efficient, and more
democratic, than the " empty velvet glove " with which britain is now
trying to defeat organized crime . " the danger in a democracy, " said
he, " does not lie in a central police that is too strong but in local
police forces that are too weak . " in day-to-day police work, the lack
of liaison between forces more than 50 per cent have fewer than 350 men
inevitably helps the criminal . another boon to careful crooks : a law
by which police are only allowed to file fingerprints of convicted
criminals, not of suspects . buckinghamshire's chief constable,
brigadier john cheny cheney (eton, sandhurst, india), did not even
enlist scotland yard's help in the train robbery until nearly a day
later . what worries many experts is that such built-in inefficiency
can only cost britain's bobbies what remains of their old prestige . as
it is, they are fighting the greatest crime wave in the nation's
history with insufficient manpower and inadequate coordination, amid
deepening public distrust that suggests their lot will be unhappier yet

south viet nam coping with capricorn in business, count the
costs before you act . the moon now in capricorn suggests keeping
practical values in mind . tomorrow is rather too energetic for
comfort, but that may be because everybody is on the move . a late
august horoscope syndicated horoscopes, many of them from abroad, are
popular features in many south vietnamese newspapers, but last week the
government banned them, presumably on the theory that
some star-minded dissident might be moved to try a coup on an
astrologically auspicious day . in south viet nam everybody was indeed
on the move, but where they were moving was no clearer than the zodiac
. the u.s . was increasingly unhappy with president ngo dinh diem
(capricorn), and after what the u.s . officially called his " brutal "
crackdown on the buddhists, washington obviously could not string along
with him as if nothing had happened . so the u.s . made noises designed
to encourage opposition to diem . but south viet nam being what it is,
potential rebels did not want to move without virtually a written
contract for u.s . support . meanwhile the u.s . tried to place the
odium of the crackdown on diem's brother, ngo dinh nhu (libra), and
new ambassador henry cabot lodge (cancer) managed to suggest, without
saying anything publicly, that he did not like what was going on . the
siege . a week after the government's crackdown, saigon looked like a
city under siege . heavily armed special forces units guarded all key
installations . mobile " anti-suicide ? ' squads
patrolled the streets, ready to douse any further buddhist attempts at
self-immolation . and anti-aircraft battery was rolled into position
outside saigon's presidential palace ; since the communist viet cong
have no planes, the government evidently feared an attack from its own
force . having jailed most buddhist leaders, the regime moved to
silence other vocal opposition saigon's seething student population .
in the city's crowded marketplace and near saigon university,
rifle-toting combat police in camouflage uniforms arrested all youths
of high school and college age in sight and
mme . nhu does not reveal the day or month
of her birth, but there is speculation that she may be aries ( " very
important to
win the test of wills " ) or leo ( " if
crossed, roars like a lion, lacks understanding of what is in the minds
of others " ) . hauled them off to detention
camps on the outskirts . throughout the city, blue-uniformed members of
nhu's republican youth organization made door-to-door calls, warning
against public criticism of the government on pain of arrest . schools
were closed until further notice, and scheduled elections for the
normally rubber-stamp, 123-member national assembly were postponed .
over radio saigon, thich tinh khiet, 80, head of the general buddhist
association, pledged his loyalty to the government, but a newspaper
picture cleared by inattentive censors showed the aged monk with a
black eye and bruises all over his face . the government explained that
he had fallen down . in other respects, censorship was stringent . in
outgoing cables from newsmen, the word catholic was blue-penciled ;
after passing the censors, one story referred to " roman president ngo
dinh diem . " the generals . at week's end martial law was gradually
eased, and some buddhists and students were freed . there was little
doubt that nhu was in large measure responsible for running things, but
there was no evidence that he was supplanting his brother ; as far as
could be detected, the two were working in harmony . directly under
nhu, two officers seemed to be in command : bespectacled, pockmarked
colonel le quang tung, in charge of the special forces, and brigadier
general ton that dinh, commander of the iii army
corps and military governor of saigon, a dapper graduate of the u.s .
command and general staff school at fort leavenworth, who wears a red
beret, carries a swagger stick, and likes to be accompanied on military
operations by his own photographer . of south viet nam's 17 generals,
dinh is one of two who actually have troops at their disposal ; the
other, brigadier general nguyen khanh, is located in a fighting area
hundreds of miles north of saigon . most of the other generals have
been deprived of real power by diem and nhu, and have
been brought to saigon where they can be watched . at a time when the
army is more important than ever in the south viet nam situation, these
officers are carefully scrutinized in washington . among them : major
general tran van don, chief of the general staff and technically in
charge of administering the country under martial law . actually he
commands only a bodyguard of 50 troops, and at the moment is considered
a figurehead . brigadier general tran tu oai, an articulate officer
whom nhu sidetracked into the post of director of the malaria
eradication program . " i'm the only general in the army, " said tran,
/ who is armed with a spray gun . " he is now chief of psychological
warfare . major general duong van minh, a tough, husky type whose mouth
is filled with gold-capped broken teeth and who is regarded as one of
the best officers in south viet nam . he is known as " big " minh, to
distinguish him from brigadier general tran van minh, or " little "
minh, no kin . he has no command at present, but
serves as diem's " military assistant . " brigadier general pham xuan
chien, onetime director of security services, who was sacked by nhu
when his ambitions began to get out of hand . he now has the virtually
meaningless job of assistant chief of staff . determined to dissociate
itself from diem's anti-buddhist policies and to keep the army on its
side the u.s . formally absolved south viet nam's military leaders of
responsibility in nhu's sacking of the buddhist temples . in an
unusually sharp statement, washington said that the generals were " not
aware of the plans to attack the pagodas, much less the brutal manner
in which they were carried out . " saigon bitterly denied the
washington statement produced a document signed by army leaders to the
effect that they had asked the government to take the action
it did . " top u.s . intelligence officials countered that army
leaders had been coerced into signing the document . the alternative .
in a country where intrigue and double-dealing are endemic, the army
officers are far from united . but one top vietnamese official secretly
in contact with army dissidents maintains that a coup can and will be
staged, that both the marines and the air force would join in any
uprising, and that there are enough disaffected army units in saigon
itself to neutralize tung's special forces . at week's end there were
muffled reports that, meeting in twos and threes, officers had agreed
on a leader who would be willing to keep diem as titular head of state
if nhu, his wife, and brother thuc, archbishop of hue, were eliminated
. no matter how real the opposition to diem, the dissidents are
obviously afraid that the u.s . might not fully back them in a coup .
as a first sign of u.s . support, they want washington to announce
cessation of aid to the diem regime . this the u.s . is not prepared to
do because it would only slash whatever influence the u.s . has in
south viet nam . besides, the u.s . believes that the diem regime can
keep going for perhaps a year even without u.s . aid . if the
opposition seems to believe that the u.s . cannot be counted on, the
u.s . reciprocates the feeling . as of last week, at least one major
policymaker in the state department felt that the solution was not to
try to force out diem but to force him into more acceptable behavior
possibly curbing brother nhu and taking other measures to redeem
himself with the buddhists . critics of this policy point out that "
controlling " diem has been a u.s . aim for years, and that no one has
yet managed to do it successfully ; they also believe that diem will
never really break with nhu or any other member of his family . in
their view, diem is now hopelessly discredited, and they urge a
different civilian ruler possibly vice president nguyen ngoe tho, who
has openly disagreed with diem backed by some efficient officers . just
how this can be accomplished is another question . the war . as if the
situation in saigon were not complicated enough, france's charles de
gaulle chose to enter it with an oracular statement that france
sympathized with " the tribulations of the vietnamese people, " and
pledged " cordial cooperation " with " all viet nam " in rooting out "
foreign influence . " he conveniently overlooked the fact that, had it
not been for france's own disastrous defeat in its nine-year vietnamese
war, the country would not be in its present mess . apart from
deliberately antagonizing the u.s . at a moment when it was caught in
an extremely difficult situation, de gaulle sounded as if he were
trying to encourage a united viet nam, with north and south together
again but neutralized . the idea seemed to be supported by none other
than north viet nam's ho chi minh, who last week glowingly predicted
diem's fall, but hinted that he might be followed by a neutralized,
laos-type government . by contrast, china's mao tse-tung, who also
commented on the south viet nam situation, seemed to oppose
neutralization, and predicted that diem would be followed by just
another " u.s . lackey . " in saigon, ambassador lodge, though plainly
playing for time, took hold firmly . in talks with both diem and nhu
(the latter described as " hostile " by insiders), lodge expressed the
u.s.'s sharp disapproval of their repressive policies . pointedly he
rejected the government's demand that the u.s . turn over two buddhist
monks who were given sanctuary in the u.s . aid mission building .
lodge's determination not to be buffaloed impressed top embassy aides .
/ i'm running things here, and i intend to run them with a firm hand, "
he told staffers . " if washington wants a weasel for this job, it can
find someone else . " lodge's first task is to see that the political
maneuvering does not affect the conduct of the war against the
communist
viet cong . at least one troop unit has been moved from a fighting zone
into the capital, and offensive military missions have been somewhat
diminished . but so far, the war against the reds hasn't been
radically hurt by events in saigon .

europe this was the summer that was " summer's lease hath
all too short a date, " sighed shakespeare in the 18th sonnet, but as
far as most of western europe is concerned, the sooner the lease runs
out the better . after one of the worst winters in memory, this summer
has proved a thing of wind and wetness, of a cool july and august
snows, of record rains and blighted harvests, of burgeoning prices and
other irritants . if such crises of daily living were minor compared
with the test ban treaty or south viet nam, they still meant a
difference between good times and bad for millions of otherwise
flourishing europeans . .britain . plainly, the seaside was fit only
for the fish, and hotelkeepers reported that bookings were off 15q6 .
for the hardy souls who went, getting there was no fun either, since
britain has only 250 miles of superhighways (compared with germany's
1,870) . since a sweeping motorways plan was adopted seven years ago,
the british have been building roads at model t rates, and planners
pale at the thought that by 1980 the current car population of
6,000,000 will have trebled . motorists grow plae at a more immediate
prospect : " transport minister ernest marples' plan to impose
parking-meter charges of 35 #$ an hour in parts of london . perhaps
most symbolic of britain's summertime complaints was the stuttering
progress on the renovation of no . 10 downing street, residence of
british prime ministers since 1735 . a parliamentary commission
pronounced the place a " horror " in 1958, packed harold macmillan off
to nearby admiralty house before the floor gave way beneath him,
estimated that it would take two years and $1,100,000 to repair the
building . but no end is in sight after five years and $8,500,000 .
matters were not helped by 14 work stoppages . but then, the building
workers were only following a pattern, for this, after all, was the
summer when even the beefeaters in the tower struck for higher wages .
.france . what most exasperated frenchmen was the foul weather . in
biarritz, 400 houses were flooded in one day, and in the somme
department, a vacationer died of exposure when he foolhardily went
swimming . there was also the wine crisis (see world business) and fear
of inflation . the latest price increases affected bread and postage
stamps ; since charles de gaulle came to power in 1958, the prices of
250 essential articles have climbed 25 per cent , excluding rents,
which have soared 82 per cent . paris newspapers spoke of a " grave
crisis, " but the government put off a scheduled discussion of the
economic situation until midmonth, when at least the weather may be
better . .germany . despite the abundance of four-lane, cement-paved
autobahnen, which are beginning to crumble at the edges, 10 million
cars owned by prospering west germans and countless tourist autos
clogged the roads in what der spiegel called " the longest traffic jam
in the history of the occident . " one tie-up stretched 20 miles,
involved 4,100 cars . some motorists have been seen drawing water from
nearby brooks and washing their cars while waiting for traffic to get
moving . what saddens some germans even more than the traffic is the
news that more than 200 of the ancient dwellings in heidelberg's
altstadt the " old town " where generations of heidelberg students
loved to stroll are near collapse from neglect and fungus rot . loath
to destroy the altstadt (and along with it a lucrative tourist trade),
heidelbergers are equally reluctant to try to raise the $50 million
needed to restore the buildings . .italy . summer skies were sunny in
italy, but that created its own problems . tourists fleeing from the
frozen north created colossal traffic jams at the brenner pass and
three-hour tie-ups along other roads . italians who flocked to
sardinia's much-ballyhooed costa esmeralda, where the aga khan is
building a resort, found themselves quartered in half-finished hotels
with neither lights nor hot water . and the annual crush of german
tourists never quite materialized . offended by a rash of italian-made
anti-german films, some german newspapers advised their readers to take
their business elsewhere . thousands did so, headed for yugoslavia
instead . .the low countries . in the netherlands, the weather hurt the
corn crop and stunted dutch bulbs, draining them of their brilliant
hues . in belgium, the flax crop is bad, and the wheat harvest in some
places is one-fourth its normal size . but of greater concern to the
belgians than the meager harvest or the tempestuous weather was a new
law that goes into effect this week, creating a formal language barrier
across the land . dutch will be the official tongue in the flemish
north, french in the walloon-dominated south, with pockets of both
peoples stranded on the wrong side . months of demonstrations
culminated last week when hundreds of flemings clashed with walloons at
ostend . it was the beer-bibbing belgians, whose per-capita inflow of
34.3 gallons is the world's highest, who put a foamy head on a
disheartening summer . they scheduled a national beer festival at the
chateau de fraiture in liege province, but before the guzzling could
even get started, the chateau burned down, lock, stock and beer barrels

iron curtain a cold war fairy tale the gently, wooded hills
framing the east german village of mupperg are ideal for a sunday
stroll but disfigured by a fearsome scar the 500-yd.-wide death strip
sealing off east from west . guarded by grepos (communist border
police) with orders to shoot anything that moves, the no man's land is
sown with mines and foot traps, every one tightly laced with three rows
of barbed wire . to blond little peter eichhorn, 2f years old and
toddling through the woods beside his twelve-year-old brother, the cold
war did not exist . he was aware only of the grass tickling his legs,
the fun-crunch of dry leaves, the scent of pine needles, the zigzag
flight of a butterfly . suddenly, during an unguarded moment, peter
dashed off, bent on exploration and discovery . by the time his brother
noticed and began searching for him, the tiny tot was beyond recall,
happily lost in the thickets and forest leading to the death strip .
three hours later, on the other side of the east-west barrier, a west
german couple enjoying an afternoon walk came upon a little boy curled
up in the grass sound asleep . his face was dirtsmudged, he had lost
one shoe, there was a scratch on his cheek but otherwise he seemed all
right . the youngest east german refugee evidently had crossed the iron
curtain with the ease of br'er rabbit skipping through the briar patch,
somehow missing the mines and the gaze of the grepos . when he woke up,
he could only say : " ich heisse peter (my name is peter) . " that
night the boy's frantic father, a small farmer, telephoned across the
border from mupperg, asking if anyone had seen his lost son, and was
told that the boy would be returned soon . taken to an orphanage in
coburg, the runaway had a party thrown in his honor, was showered with
lollipops, bananas, toys and clothing rare luxuries for an east zone
child . two days later, bundled into the interzonal train and stuffed
with goodies, peter was returned, past embarrassed grepos to his
parents and a communist world he doesn't yet understand .

where god is black most black africans
only learned to write down their songs and tales in the past hundred
years, but they are heirs to centuries of oral literature . in their
search for an african identity, the continent's contemporary poets many
of them leading politicians today have forsaken their mission-school
golden treasury to rediscover the pagan rhymes and rhythms that
enlivened tribal life long before the white man came . says leopold
sedar senghor, who is black africa's most distinguished poet as well as
president of senegal : " poetry must find its way back to its origins
. " the attempt to explore and revive these origins is illustrated in a
new anthology, poems from black africa (indiana university press ;
$4.95), edited by u.s . negro poet langston hughes . some of the poets
are self-consciously primitive, and a few of the english-speaking ones
write with echoes of t . s . eliot or gerard manley hopkins . but they
are also busy transcribing and translating traditional folk

silence of my desk to walk on wave crests across a sea . maybe i'm a

lost his powers of invocation . but the voices and the trees are one

south africa blockade in the air twenty minutes from niamey,
niger, approaching for a night landing, the pilot of the chartered
south african constellation received an unsettling message from the
control tower : turn away or have the plane seized on the ground .
with his fuel tanks almost empty, the pilot had to set down anyway, and
the connie, its crew and 79 passengers most of them white south
africans returning from european holiday were surrounded by black
guards armed with rusty rifles . not until 24 hours later was the
flight allowed to resume, and local authorities warned that in the
future intruding south african planes would be confiscated . at last
may's african " summit conference " in addis ababa, south africa's
neighbors called for an economic boycott, to include the banning of
south african aircraft from airports and airspace . by last week an
air curtain
had closed african skies to south african airways, whose proud symbol
is a winged springbok, forcing its planes into a tortuous detour .
until last month, s.a.a.'s boeing 707 jets operated two efficient
routes between johannesburg and europe one along africa's east fringe,
via nairobi, kenya ; the other almost due north via brazzaville, in
the once-french congo . trouble began when, implementing the addis
ababa agreement, egypt, algeria, ethiopia and sudan barred south
african aircraft from overflying their territories . s.a.a . rerouted
all its flights over libya . but then libya also joined the air
blockade . fortnight ago s.a.a . inaugurated a carefully prepared,
out-of-the-way alternate route around west africa's bulge, via
brazzaville (which so far has not joined the ban), luanda, capital of
portuguese angola, and las palmas in the spanish canary islands (see
map) . the " apartheid route " takes about 900 miles and two hours
longer to europe, costs an estimated $3,000 more to operate each way,
so that s.a.a . may well be hard pressed to preserve its share of the
lucrative european market as well as last year's handsome $1,500,000
profit . as usual, south africa's white regime took its latest
humiliation in stolid stride . following an agreement quietly signed
last may with portugal, its likeminded ally, south africa is putting up
$5,300,000 to help construct a jet airport on the cape verde island of
sal as an additional refueling stop . south african minister of
transport ben schoeman assured everyone that the island-hopping detour
is every bit as safe as the old routes . " we are flying and will keep
flying, " he vowed . the airline has already launched an advertising
campaign extolling the scenic charms of such offbeat places as luanda
and las palmas, and a cape town columnist eloquently extolled the uses
of adversity . " boycotts have turned us into smarter salesmen, " the
pundit wrote . " arms embargoes have forced us to make our own weapons,
and the air ban has sent a patriotic thrill running down the south

began to sample opinions around sarawak, they were nearly stoned, not
bored, to death . in the chinese-dominated town of sibu, the
red-infiltrated sarawak united people's party (supp) staged a
demonstration that turned into a 90-minute, stone-throwing riot . only
after police fired warning shots to disperse the mob could the u.n .
team sit down amidst broken glass in a methodist schoolhouse to
interview local councilors . in miri, sarawak's oil-refining center,

anti-malaysia slogans until the police opened fire, wounding two, and
tear gas forced them to scatter . date set . such outbursts will
slightly delay but not derail the formation of malaysia, originally
scheduled for aug . 31 . in last summer's general elections, voters in
both sarawak and north borneo decisively defeated anti-federation
parties . although indonesia's shadow looms large, the borned people
know they have nothing to gain from djakarta but economic chaos and
demagoguery . malayan prime minister tunku abdul rahman and british

week set sept . 16 as the new birth date for the federation two days
after the u.n . mission's findings will be made public . both are sure
that the u.n . will find a clear majority in favor of malaysia, but
they insist that the federation will come into being regardless of the
report . the british last week also turned over internal
self-government
to borneo and sarawak . in a wrangle over details with the british,
indonesia failed to send observers to the u.n . mission, thus giving
sukarno an excuse to question the u.n . findings later . but faced with
british determination to defend malaysia by force, if necessary,
sukarno said : " if the borneo peoples agree to join malaysia, we will
have to bow our heads and obey . " but, added sukarno, in an unbowed
postscript : " indonesia maintains its opposition to malaysia . " book
learning . an indonesian guerrilla campaign against borneo and sarawak
may well continue, since djakarta always needs a foreign diversion to
draw attention from domestic difficulties . in indonesian borneo,
which adjoins sarawak, sukarno has set up guerrilla camps along 200
miles of border, and is training 1,000 red-lining chinese from sarawak,
following the guidelines of indonesian defense minister general abdul
haris nasution, an expert on guerrilla warfare who has written his own
book on the subject . bands of his guerrillas pushed across the border
to raid dyak villages clashed with patrols of british-led gurkhas and
sarawak police . in a fire fight ten miles inside sarawak, the
indonesians killed a british lieutenant and wounded several gurkhas
before being routed with heavy losses . meanwhile, british officers are
studying nasution's book for clues to stop further indonesian
incursions . so far, indonesian terrorist attacks have only served to
create a surge of pro-malaysia feeling in borneo and sarawak . almost
nightly, the indonesian embassy in north borneo is plastered with
slogans reading " tunku yes, sukarno no . " although his people stopped
head-hunting years ago, one dyak chief told the u.n . fact finders that
/ if any more indonesian bandits come into our territory, they may lose
their heads . /

amen ! for generations
the white women's burden in steamy southeast asia has been shouldered
by amahs, the softfooted, tough-fibered maidservants who were recruited
from the chinese mainland . while the amah (literally, " little mother
/ ) cooked, cleaned and looked after the children, the colonel's lady
or planter's wife spent her mornings at tennis, her afternoons at
bridge, and appeared freshly starched on the veranda at sundown to
greet her returning husband with cold stingers, hot curry and eternal
complaint about the hardships of life in the tropics . in malaya and
singapore today, a mem-sahib is more apt to spend her day screaming at
the amah, doing the housework herself, or else trying to poach the
perfect gem who works for the arbuthnots . for the old-style amahs,
whose white tunics, black silk pajama trousers and smoothly braided
hair made them look like pigtailed penguins, belong to a dying race .
smashed wedgwood . most new nations of southeast asia have enough
trouble already with chinese minorities and are dead-set against
bringing in more refugees from the mainland . hastening their
extinction is the fact that many of the finer amahs are cantonese women
who traditionally belong to kongsis, or sisterhoods, that pledge them
to spinsterhood . amahs from hainan, on the other hand, are usually
married . their husbands used to be admirable crichtons of colonial
society, and their daughters in time used to follow mother's footsteps
across the gleaming floors .
though well-trained amahs nowadays earn up to $70 a month a high wage
for malaya their daughters mostly prefer office and factory jobs that
give them greater freedom with no overtones of colonialism . their
places are being taken by a new generation of flibbertigibbets whose
minds are apt to be more on men than helping the " mem . " mostly
malayan or indian girls, with a sprinkling of untrained chinese, they
are prettier and more sophisticated than their forebears and, say their
mems, often downright insolent . for their part, the maids complain
bitterly that the rapidly expanding malayan middle class is even more
tyrannical than the bossiest britons . if fledgling amahs have a talent
for smashing the wedgwood, the wives of british soldiers and
technicians, coming from a land where servants have vanished from all
but the stateliest homes, tend to be even clumsier at handling the help
. wailed one sub-lieutenant's wife who recently hired her first maid :
/ i don't know whether to treat her as a servant or a sister . " fringe
benefits . the amahs' answer is that they should be treated as civil
servants . in malaya an army of 1,000 amahs donned sunday-best sarongs,
cheongsams and saris, piled into a fleet of busses and drove into kuala
lumpur, the capital, where they minced prettily through the winding
streets waving placards inscribed : we want justice and we are not
animals . the demonstration, which left blimps snorting and oldstyle
amahs sneering, climaxed a complicated dispute in which the amahs'
union is challenging a british war office decision to abandon its
practice of hiring and firing all the amahs employed by military
personnel . some 3,000 unionized amahs have already forced the british
to boost their pay and cut their work time from 70 to 48 hours weekly .
by remaining government employees, they hope also to win full civil
service status, with its rich welfare benefits . in its zeal, the union
even cabled london, " respectfully " requesting queen elizabeth to
intervene in the dispute . after unsuccessful talks with the military
and british high commissioner sir geofroy tory, the aroused amahs last
week direly threatened a walkout . for many of their mems, no help at
all could hardly be worse than the helpless help they had .

communists advice from the host winding up his 15-day state visit
to yugoslavia last week, nikita khrushchev found himself playing an
unusual role that of listener . evidently he hoped to offset the
russian split with red china by getting closer to tito, with whom
relations ever since 1955 have alternated between fairly warm and
fairly chilly . khrushchev not only swallowed tito's determination to
maintain his status as a communist " independent, " but in a four-day
session at the island retreat of brioni patiently listened to his
host's advice on how to outbid the chinese in the struggle for the
leadership of the red world . red summit . according to probably
deliberate conference leaks, tito told khrushchev that russia must play
up to the emerging afro-asian nations to halt increasing chinese
penetration . added tito : as long as china is not a member of the u.n
. (both russia and yugoslavia favor peking's admission, but with waning
enthusiasm), moscow could make headway by supporting the afro-asian
drive for membership in the u.n . security and economic and social
councils . tito also said that russia is being too doctrinaire in
writing off afro-asian countries such as syria, algeria, egypt and
iraq, which have outlawed local communist parties . since most of the
emerging states are adopting one-party socialist governments anyway,
said tito, the soviets should back them for the time being, worry about
pushing communism later . tito and khrushchev agreed to hold an
anti-chinese communist summit conference soon, both to consolidate
russia's position in the conflict with china and to state formally that
chinese warmongering is far more harmful to world communism than
yugoslavia's " revisionism . " but tito and his guest seemed to shy
away from much closer relations . tito ignored khrushchev's apparent
desire to address the yugoslav parliament, and russia cold-shouldered
yugoslavia's request for massive economic aid, granted belgrade only
observer status in comecon, the satellites' more or less common market
. " differences still exist between us on party matters, " said one
yugoslav official . " if we press for closer contacts, an open quarrel
might develop . " on to cuba . at a joint press conference with tito,
khrushchev announced that he is not coming to the u.n . general
assembly in new york this month but is going to cuba instead, also
hinted that he might be available for a visit to egypt . then he gave
the press a sample of his famous earthiness . when a questioner sought
to bring out discord between russia and yugoslavia by asking him to
compare living standards in the two countries (higher in yugoslavia),
khrushchev got angry . " why are you trying to sniff a smell from the
rectum ? " he said . " this is not the most beautiful part of the
body . " anyway, khrushchev added blissfully, soviet relations with
yugoslavia are " eternal . /

united nations anger in the council adlai stevenson had not been
so angry in the u.n . since last year's cuban crisis . " this
reprehensible act of murder, " he said before the security council, "
deserves the strongest condemnation . outrages of this kind cannot pass
without the stern disapproval of the international community . /
stevenson was referring
to a bloody flare-up on the israeli-syrian frontier touched off, israel
charged, when ten syrian soldiers sneaked across the jordan river and
the demilitarized zone and machine-gunned two 19-year-old farmers
irrigating a kibbutz field north of the sea of galilee . the syrians
denied the killings, accused israel of sending 15 armored cars charging
across the border . last week, with both countries having brought
complaints to an emergency session of the security council (its 202nd
session on a palestine-related issue), the u.n.'s truce chief on the
scene, norwegian lieut . general odd bull, left little doubt that syria
had been the aggressor . backed up by photographs, spent bullets and
diagrams, bull's report told of finding " two dead bodies riddled with
holes ; a tractor with numerous bullet holes ; a magazine from an
automatic weapon ; a lever handle from a grenade ; . . . a pool of
blood where one man allegedly had been shot, leaving part of his brain
; tracks leading from the direction of the jordan river to the ambush
position and the tracks returning in the direction of the jordan river
. " in the past, israel has usually made routine complaints to the
u.n . when there were
truce breaches on the bristling border, then staged heavily retaliatory
raids of its own . when such incidents came before the security
council, the u.s . usually stayed neutral . this time israel had
followed u.s . advice and appealed for security council action hence
the u.s . policy switch to support israel . at week's end the u.s . and
great britain introduced a joint resolution that condemned " the wanton
murder " and called " the attention of the syrian arab republic " to
the assembled evidence . the russians, who in the past have usually
threatened to use their veto in support of the arabs, backed moroccan
amendments watering down the u.s.-british resolution ; the moroccan
version avoided condemnation of syria and merely registered " regrets
for the death of two persons . /

red china the self-bound gulliver
(see cover) " communism is not love ! " cried mao tse-tung . "
communism is a hammer we use to destroy our enemies ! " mao, the
somewhat enigmatic ruler of red china, has certainly been flailing in
all directions with his hammer of late, but nothing much has been
destroyed . even nikita khrushchev, mao's most recent target, has
emerged unscathed from peking's incessant blows . the only thing mao
has done with his paper hammer is to fan new hatreds for himself and
his red regime . tiny allies . not too long ago, red china had friends
galore . many of the underdeveloped nations of asia, and colonial
peoples everywhere, listened admiringly to mao's boastful plans of a
swift transition from poverty to plenty . the left wing in western
europe and the u.s., disenchanted with stalin's terror, saw mao as a
new and nobler architect of a peoples' socialism . in the united
nations, it seemed only a matter of time before rambunctious afro-asian
votes overcame u.s . resistance to the idea of taking china's seat away
from the nationalists on formosa and giving it to the communist regime
. but mao finds little sympathy anywhere in the world today . he has
embroiled his hard-pressed country in simultaneous feuds with the u.s.,
the soviet union and india, the three most populous nations in the
world after his own . in fact, he has plunged china into an isolation
so complete that he can count as certain allies only tiny north korea
in asia and even tinier albania in europe .
it seems like sheer
lunacy for mao to challenge the two greatest powers on earth at a time
when china's industry and agriculture are still staggering from the
disasters of the great leap forward and before he has the armaments to
engage in any large-scale contest . but it is entirely possible that
mao may have come to feel that the only way to break china's economic
fetters, and still abide by his harsh ideological tenets, lies in a
dramatic change in the international political order . to that end he
has emphasized both race and color in his attempt to win friends and
alliances . red china has always dreamed of one day employing
indonesia's oil, thailand's rice, even japan's technology, as fuel for
a huge asian alliance that could safely defy the west . and now mao has
been emphasizing color as a way to align the have-not nations of asia
and africa against the west .
pandas & tigers . it would seem obvious that mao
tse-tung has enough trouble at home without looking for it abroad . the
great leap forward, launched with such fanfare in 1958, was intended to
bring quick success in 1) building a pure communist state, and 2)
making china over into a first-class world power . instead, the leap's
frenzied mobilization of peasants into communes, the setting up of
backyard blast furnaces, and the 24-hour-a-day speedup in the factories
nearly wrecked the nation . today, china's aging red leadership
(average age : 63) knows that it will never see the promised land, and
that china must labor on for at least a quarter century perhaps much
longer before accomplishing the second goal . what manner of country
and what sort of people must the communists deal with in trying to
accomplish their mission ? china, of course, is enormous 14 times the
size of texas . it extends 2,400 miles from the banks of the amur river
in topmost manchuria to the tropical jungle border with viet nam, and
2,500 miles across from the indented coast on the china sea to the
kunlun mountains deep in central asia . inside this vast domain lies
just about every variety of flora and fauna imaginable, from rollicking
pandas to prowling tigers, from the invigorating ginseng root to groves
of thin nanmu trees . to its people, china simply means " here . "
since the days of prehistory, china has traditionally been a world in
itself, separated from outside barbarians by the most perfect of
physical barriers . on the east and south is the pacific, the largest
of oceans . to the west rises the highest plateau on earth . in the
north stretch thousands of miles of desert ; and here, to prevent
repeated incursions of hard-riding nomads . chinese emperors built the
1,500-mile great wall . rebellion's home . though united by an ancient
culture, china has never been as monolithic as it looks . an eastwest
line drawn across the country between the valleys of the yangtze and
yellow rivers divides north from south china . north of the line,
summers are short and hot, winters long and bitterly cold, and the
principal crops are wheat and millet . the men of north china are often
as tall as americans, relatively placid, ceremonial and say the
southerners slow-thinking . south of the line, the climate is hot and
humid, and the principal crop is rice . broken up into valleys and
small plains by innumerable mountain ranges, the south is the home of
individualism, anarchy and mystical introspection . the shortstatured
southerners speak a multitude of dialects, are commercially
enterprising and perennially rebellious almost every chinese revolution
has originated in the south . practically all chinese citizens of the
u.s . came originally from a small south china area near canton called
toishan, which is today, curiously enough, known in china as " the home
of volleyball . /
nation's birthplace . china's 22 provinces baffle
foreigners because so many of them sound alike (honan, hunan ;
kiangsu, kiangsi nsi, shensi) . most typical of the northern provinces
is perhaps hopeh, which contains the capital city of peking . from its
rugged border with manchuria, the province runs down in a shelving
plain to the shallow gulf of chihli . very few eminent communists come
from hopeh or its neighboring province of shansi, which is noted for
sacred mountains and such spectacular cave temples as yun kang, where a
mile-long cliff face has been chiseled into thousands of buddhist
images . shensi is reverenced as the birthplace of the chinese nation,
and when the country was first unified by the ch'in dynasty in 221
b.c., its capital was near present-day sian . south china is a much
larger and more varied region than the north . the people of kiangsi
are the scots of china and are said to be clannish, stingy and
quarrelsome . they have had long experience of communism and,
presumably, few illusions, since the chinese soviet republic was
established there in 1931 and held out against the nationalists until
1934, when mao led what was left of his troops on the 8,000-mile long
march to yenan in the north . kiangsi's sound-alike neighbor, kiangsu,
had a reputation for voluptuousness and easy living . the kiangsu city
of soochow was the sybaris of old china, and prostitutes in all parts
of the country tried to imitate the soft soochow dialect with its
musical, rounded vowels . land of leaders . the fruit-rich province of
shantung, home of confucius and his fellow sage mencius, is inhabited
by a sturdy peasantry that speaks a mandarin dialect so harsh and
unmelodic that chinese say, " better to quarrel with a man from soochow
than to converse civilly with a shantungese . " beautiful szechwan
boasts that it grows enough food to feed five provinces, and it is
filled with terraced hills, rivers, coal and valuable minerals . anhwei
contains the sugar-loaf mountains and pinnacled rocks made famous by
the misty paintings of chinese artists . to the communists, the three
most important provinces are the southern states of hunan, chekiang and
kwangtung, which produced most of today's red leaders. mao tse-tung
was born near the capital city of changsha, as was his no . 2 man, liu
shao-chi . other red hunanese : labor boss li li-san, army commanders
peng teh-huai and lo jung-huan . kwangtung, with its capital city of
canton, is the nerve center of south china . its men have a reputation
for pugnacity and business enterprise, its women for slim, almondeyed
beauty . way out west . beyond china proper extend vast territories
that were conquered centuries ago but often lightly held by the chinese
. the broad plains of manchuria have become the three provinces of
kirin, heilungkiang, and liaoning . shenyang, formerly known as mukden,
is the pittsburgh of china, and its steel mills are within sight of the
felt-covered tents of manchu herdsmen, who are now outnumbered about 30
to 1 by chinese immigrants .
as well as most of generalissimo chiang kai-shek's unseated kuomintang
chiefs .
at inner mongolia begins china's far west, which
almost exactly resembles that of the u.s . prairie, desert and towering
mountains and is inhabited by the chinese equivalent of american
indians, the uighur, kazakh and khirghiz tribesmen, who are distinct in
race and religion (moslem) from their overlords . the tribesmen have
repeatedly rebelled against all central governments and make no
exception of the communist regime . leap's loss . no one can say with
accuracy how many people live within china's borders . the communists'
1953 census said 582 million . the chinese nationalists argue that this
figure was too high ; in fact, says the u.s . census bureau, it was
far too low, and virtually all western experts agree . in any case, the
u.s . state department believes that china's population in june of this
year was somewhere in the neighborhood of 720 million . this land and
this people have now lived for 14 years under the rule of the
communists . the gains have been convulsive : schools built at the
same frenzied pace as tractor plants ; hospitals rushed up in
provinces that had scarcely even seen a doctor ; roads and railways
thrown over gorges, through mountains and across deserts . the pace was
so fast and frenzied that it resulted in mismanagement and
administrative lunacy to the extent that the communists have lost china
a good five years in its rebuilding, and the nation is now estimated to
be just about where it was in 1957 in industry and crop production .
even in 1957, supplies were just barely sufficient for needs, and since
that time, at least 70 million more chinese have been born and must be
fed, clothed, housed and educated . peking has dug into its slender
cash reserves to buy wheat from abroad at a total cost of $782 million
. the quarrel with russia has been
equally damaging . when soviet engineers and
technicians were abruptly called home in 1960, they not only left many
construction jobs incomplete but also took their blueprints with them .
peking finds spare parts for soviet equipment hard to get, and must
cannibalize some machines to keep others working . many factories are
now devoted to making spare parts instead of new items . heavy industry
has had to give way to light, and at least two plants formerly making
railroad cars are now turning out rubber-tired handcarts and
wheelbarrows . iron monuments . agriculture is china's jugular vein,
and the year's critical period is the winter crop harvest, which takes
place in spring and early summer . current estimates are that this
year's crop will fluctuate around the 180-185 million tons of grain
achieved last year a good but not a sensationally great harvest year .
the communes of the great leap exist no longer
except on paper, and the countryside is dotted with rusting pillars of
pig iron, melancholy memorials of the backyard furnaces that mao
thought would revitalize china . the typical farm unit now is a
production team of 25 to 40 families, which are given considerable
autonomy in deciding what and when to plant . private plots were
returned to the peasants in 1961, and are producing well for the free
market . as usual, the communists keep close watch : the stick comes
down in the form of close regulation of the free market, and the carrot
is dangled in the guarantees of slightly higher prices for crops sold
to the state over and above the compulsory deliveries . in the past and
in the foreseeable future, every harvest becomes a time of national
breath holding . in a borderline economy like that of china, any
improvement is immediately felt, and so is every decline . double
selves . but what most threatens the regime is the squandered reserves
of good will among millions of chinese who had been impressed by the
communists' display of strength, incorruptibility and iron discipline .
more than by physical labor, the chinese have been worn out by mass
brain-washing sessions, public-accusation meetings, collective
confessions, and endless " struggle " conferences in which relays of
reds upbraid backsliders . as a result, harried citizens develop what
one expert calls " double selves, an outer, superficial self that
conforms to communist demands, and an inner, moral self that remains
hidden . " but in general, rigid discipline fell away with the collapse
of the great leap, and food rations were increased to appease a restive
citizenry . more recently, a new campaign has been instituted to stamp
out apathy . it is a more sophisticated project . these days no one
urges the citizenry to collect flies in matchboxes ; the cry is :
fight waste, fight corruption, fight privilege . nice to mothers . some
of the trappings of the new propaganda campaign are weird . in recent
months, newspapers and magazines have rejoiced over the behavior of the
/ good 8th company on nanking road, " an army detachment on garrison
duty in the heart of wicked shanghai . these heroes have preserved
their communist purity for 14 long years in the face of innumerable
temptations by bourgeois capitalist devils . when " professional
loafers " tried to bribe them with wads of banknotes, the money was
spurned ; when " overdressed women accosted them on the street, the
soldiers ordered them away . " one soldier found a penny and promptly
turned it over to the company's political instructor, who explained to
the others : " one cent is almost nothing, but if he had kept it, he
would have a shady spot in his heart . /
even more edifying is the case of 22-year-old lei feng,
a squad leader in an army transport company stationed in manchuria . in
the bad old days, his father was buried alive by the japanese, his two
brothers starved to death, and his mother hanged herself after being
raped by a landlord . in the good new days, lei feng was always helping
old ladies across streets, buying railway tickets for mothers who had
lost theirs, rushing out to do volunteer work on dikes and canals, and
digging with his fingers when his shovel broke . lei feng died last
year in an accident but, fortunately for the propagandists, left behind
a 200,000-word diary filled with such sentiments as " i think my
purpose in life is to work for a better life for others, " and, " i am
all for the party, socialism and communism . " hailed as the ideal
communist, lei feng is intended to be the model for chinese youth who
have trouble identifying with the grizzled veterans of the long march
and the civil war . in the past year, at least 40 books have been
written about lei feng, and 1,000 storytellers roam the villages
enthralling illiterate peasants with his exploits and his love of mao .
collecting coupons . but if lei feng represents the mythical young
chinese, what is the reality like .? one answer came last week from a
u.s . turncoat, belgian-born albert belhomme, a former g.i . who had
defected to china after the korean war . after ten years in china,
belhomme and two other u.s . defectors, lowell skinner and scott rush,
became politically disillusioned and were allowed to leave the country
. belhomme says the average wage at the paper factory in tsinan where
he was employed was about $18 a month . single workers lived in
dormitories with four bunks to a room, families in oneroom apartments
in blocks of brick flats . during lunch breaks at the factory, belhomme
recalls, workers " talked mostly about food, how to get food, and
prices . " when an office worker referred to the communist cadres as "
golden boys, " his reward was a trip to a " labor-education camp, " and
then to jail . on his return to the factory, he was re-employed, but as
a common laborer . in china today, food is plentiful in some areas,
scarce in others . so it is with items such as cloth . last year, when
the cloth ration in canton was only 1f feet per person annually, it was
7 feet in tsinan . to buy commodities, workers needed coupons as well
as money : one coupon, plus the necessary cash price, got a small
cooking pot . each citizen also received a ticket for two bars of
toilet soap a year, and one of laundry soap per month, and there were
ration cards for cooking oil, flour, sugar and sweets . the meat ration
in tsinan is currently three ounces a month, and grain is 37 pounds for
men doing " medium-heavy " work . (most towns also have free markets,
at which food is available off ration at high prices.) says belhomme :
/ people are not hungry today, but they are definitely not full . /
the grimness and scarcity of life in china is
sometimes brightened by exploits testifying to the ingenuity and dogged
work of its citizens . canada's dr . wilder penfield, one of the
world's top neurosurgeons, returned last week from red china and told
of a university of shanghai medical team that built a heart-lung
machine from scratch in 18 months . when they tested it with dogs, the
animals died of air bubbles in the heart . the chinese went back to
work, guided only by articles in medical journals, and three years
later came up with a far better machine which has now been used in 60
successful openheart surgical cases . planned blessings . china's
future depends largely upon the pillars of the party : the army and
the students . from all three must come the skills and dedication
needed to deal with the staggering problems posed by overpopulation and
underproduction . at the top of the pyramid is chairman mao tse-tung,
whom the party acknowledges to be omnipotent and incapable of mistakes
. the people are endlessly told that mao is the sun, the lodestar, the
living buddha, and he is said to be far greater " than the empty,
hypocritical and negative jesus christ . " peasants are taught to sing
: the sun is rising in the east . china has brought forth a mao
tsetung . he plans blessings for the people . aiyayao, he is the
peoples' great savior ! whatever the propaganda, mao has worked for
more than 30 years with the other six members of the standing committee
of the 19-man politburo without an internal bloodbath a record
unmatched by any other modern tyranny, communist or fascist . among
this band of brothers, dissent is possible you may lose your job but
not your head . economic chief chen yun opposed mao's great leap and it
only cost him a temporary fall from power . the other five committeemen
are heir apparent liu shao-chi (time, oct . 12, 1959), premier chou
en-lai (time, may 10, 1954), defense minister lin piao, vice premier
teng hsiao-ping and congress chairman chu teh . unhappy generals . the
people's liberation army now 2,600,000 strong is by far the most
impressive product of red china, but there is evidence of
dissatisfaction at the top and bottom of the army . among the generals,
those having a guerrilla mentality conflict with the professionals, who
argue that to obtain the supplies needed by a modern army, china must
cooperate closely with the soviet union . defense minister peng
teh-huai, leading spokesman for the professionals, was dismissed from
his post in 1959, but remains a member of the communist central
committee . the sino-soviet split seriously hampers the air force
(3,000 planes, half of them old-fashioned mig-15 fighters), which has
been dependent on russia for aircraft, jet fuel and spare parts . the
split with moscow doubtless upset many high-ranking officers, and last
may the party launched one of the biggest of its periodic cleansings of
the armed forces . nineteen new army regulations were announced . their
aim was to " place the army under absolute party leadership and to
guarantee that the army will advance victoriously in line with the
directives of party chairman mao tse-tung . /
peking posters . red china's educational system is based
on promotion of the best students and work for the rest often as "
cultured peasants " to raise the intellectual level in the villages .
these luckless students and their families hate the whole business, and
the communist press is campaigning to make ex-students " gladly "
accept their work assignments . one paper recently heaped glory on the
college students who smirked scarcely at all when one old grad came
back to take a job on the campus cleaning the toilets . the schools
have become a casualty of the great leap . in 1961-62 enrollment was
cut 20 per cent , and then cut another 20 per cent the following year .
this is a dangerous business, for it was student disaffection that made
the communists' task all the easier in their final big push against the
kuomintang . communism's problem, at this moment of industrial
slowdown, is that there is a shortage of technical and managerial jobs,
not of educated people . the communist party has viewed the students
with considerable suspicion ever since the period of the hundred
flowers, when student manifestos and posters denouncing government
excesses were slapped on every space available . some tattered bits of
these inflammatory posters still cling to the walls and ceilings at
peking university, which has an enrollment of 100,000 . among the
thousands of chinese refugees pouring into hong kong in the past year
and a half there has been a small trickle of engineers and
intellectuals, former believers who are now disillusioned . they are
not party members, and the number is not large ; the significance lies
in the fact that it is the first time such communist-educated
intellectuals have been fleeing red china . sheaf of secrets . the
sino-soviet exchanges are reaching such a point of bitterness that in
earlier and simpler times, both nations would have been mobilizing
their armies . yet, for all the intemperateness of its language, peking
has been notably cautious about getting deeply involved beyond red
china's own frontiers in line with the red chinese axiom, " despise the
enemy strategically, but respect him tactically . " the west got an
inside look at red china's perspective on great-power conflicts back in
1961, when u.s . agents obtained possession of a 40,000-word sheaf of
secret bulletins that had been issued to officers by the general
political affairs department of red china's army . in one bulletin,
laos was described as an imperialist cork to keep chinese influence out
of southeast asia . with typical self-concern, the chinese called laos
the " focus " of the " worldwide anti-imperialist struggle, " although,
for the russians, berlin was far more vital . but peking welcomed the
cease-fire ordered by the geneva agreements . partly, this was in line
with their traditional formula of fight a little, talk a little . the
captured documents disclosed the military tie-up with the 1961 spring
of despair at home, when red china faced internal uprisings, widespread
food shortages, and morale problems in the army itself . soldiers
grumbled at conditions in the villages, complaining that " at present,
what the farmers eat is even worse than what dogs eat, " and charging "
village cadres with beating and scolding people just as in the old
society . " peking wanted no additional trouble in laos . where's the
bomb ? another reason for chinese caution was the gloomy conviction
that moscow would withhold help . warned a communist general, " if
there is a war within three to five years, we will have to rely on the
weapons we now have . " today the weapons china most desperately wants
nuclear warheads are nowhere in sight . peking is so bitter about
moscow's reneging on its 1957 agreement to help create a red chinese
atom bomb that it has broadcast details of the russian about-face .
chinese physicists are now believed to be two to three years away from
detonating a nuclear blast, farther still from what the experts call a
/ significant capability . " but work proceeds on the project, for
peking hopes that achievement of nuclear status, however primitive,
will gain prestige among the underdeveloped millions on earth whose
respect and alliance the red chinese are out to win .
the noise from peking showed no sign of diminishing and continued to
fascinate the non-communist world with fresh tales of old skeletons in
communist
closets . in one announcement, red china took full credit for forcing a
weak-kneed khrushchev ( " who had decided to abandon socialist hungary
to counterrevolution " ) to send russian tanks into budapest and crush
the 1956 uprising . peking radio also made an unprecedented reference
to important factional disputes within the top ranks of the chinese
communist party . khrushchev was accused of openly voicing support for
/ antiparty elements " in china . western experts believe the chinese "
elements " khrushchev was supporting were military men who opposed the
growing sino-soviet split, most likely former defense minister peng
teh-huai and his deputy, huang ke-cheng . khrushchev is additionally
charged with trying to sell peking on a " two chinas " plan as a means
of settling mao's quarrel with generalissimo chiang kai-shek . peking
radio also confirmed earlier reports that russia was stirring up the
kazakh tribesmen in sinkiang against their chinese masters . only last
year, red china charged, russia had lured some 10,000 kazakhs in
sinkiang into crossing the border into soviet kazakhstan . despite
repeated protest from peking, russia refused to give back the kazakhs
because of " humanitarianism " a pretext that china clearly regarded
as ludicrous . whether or not red china succeeds in its great design to
be leader of an afro-asian-latin american alliance, mao tse-tung will
not be around to see the result . at 69, mao now needs help in walking
. he disappears for long stretches, reportedly to meditate in his
pavilion facing lovely west lake in hangchow . no one really knows why
he gave up the chairmanship of the government in 1958 after one term in
office . perhaps it was to devote more time to his key job as head of
the party . or was he preparing an orderly transition for his successor
? so deep is the cleavage between china and the soviet union that it
could hardly be resolved except by the death or disappearance of either
mao or khrushchev . but, after mao, who ? the immediate successor is
almost certain to be liu shao-chi, the party's no . 2 man . after that,
it is anyone's guess . comments a china expert : " from the outside,
one can see the forces that must, or should be, coming to grips in the
arena of china's internal power struggle . but we can only see these
forces intellectually and, i repeat, from the outside . we can't
translate them into real developments or individuals within china . "
waiting in the wings are the young and middle-aged party
leaders pragmatic technicians rather than fanatic dogmatists who have
been frustrated during the years of old guard rule . mao and the
veterans of the long march have suffered few deaths . but a series of
state funerals is obviously and actuarially, in the cards . china's
future, and that of world communism, clearly depends on which emergent
chinese communists will carry the coffins .

middle east the mess in yemen the nasty little war in
yemen, one year old this month, is dragging on in grand disregard for
the peace-seeking efforts of the u.n . neither egypt nor saudi arabia
has honored its pledge, which both made earlier this year under u.s .
mediation pressure, to disengage simultaneously from yemen . although
nasser has sent home six shiploads of troops, he has rotated in fresh
detachments, and at least 20,000 egyptian soldiers are still in yemen
propping up the republican regime of president abdullah sallal . all
the while, money and munitions from the monarchies of saudi arabia and
jordan still pour across the 25-mile-wide buffer zone to royalist
tribesmen supporting dethroned imam mohamed el badr . so far as the
actual fighting is concerned, it is still a standoff, with the
republicans controlling the cities and the plains, and the royalists
holed up in and defending key strong points in the central mountains .
short rations . it is all very frustrating for the 200-man u.n . team,
which was rushed to the scene from the gaza strip two months ago in an
effort to stop the shooting . the unit, made up mostly of yugoslav
soldiers and canadian airmen, was far too small to police the vast,
empty yemen frontier, and from the start it was plagued by bad breaks
and hostility from local authorities . the team's first commander,
swedish major general carl von horn, had hardly set up headquarters in
the mudwalled capital of san " a when his horse, being led down a dusty
street, kicked a yemeni government official, resulting in the arrest of
both groom and horse . u.n . planes are regularly fired on (none has
been downed so far), and last month a russian-made egyptian ilyushin
jet bomber attacking najran inside saudi arabia nearly scored a
direct hit on a u.n . platoon . getting into the act, the russians have
sent in at least 900 workmen and technicians, who are constructing a
new jet airport north of san " a . recently, the russians threw an
inquiring u.n . inspector off the premises when he approached the
airport to conduct a routine inspection . apart from such harassment,
the u.n . teams found it downright dangerous to travel around the
country . all in all, admitted u.n . secretary-general u thant, in
effect, the u.n.sanctioned project has been a flop . and for him it has
been a rather messy flop, for in the past three weeks he and von horn
have had an ugly exchange of recriminations . the prestigious but
stormy von horn, first u.n . chief in the congo and for five years head
of the u.n.'s palestine peace-keeping force, suddenly resigned in a
cable to thant, charging lack of sufficient logistic support, aircraft
and even rations . thant branded von horn's charges " irresponsible and
reckless, " announced last week
that the mission would continue, thanks to " oral
assurances " by egypt and saudi arabia that they would continue
splitting the bill ($200,000 per month) for another two months . sick
rebel . one victim of the yemen conflict is the man who started it all
by overthrowing the imam : ex-palace guard, now president and field
marshal, abdullah sallal, 42 . last month sallal flew to cairo for
talks with nasser, but entered a hospital and was discharged for
convalescence only last week . a physician who helped treat sallal
confided that he was suffering from a nervous breakdown . " president
nasser visited him once briefly . we gave him tranquilizers . we
brought in egypt's greatest comedian, ismayen yessin, to raise his
spirits . we showed him movies . we flew in his wife from yemen, " the
doctor related, but added sadly : " his sickness is really political .
if we could give him good news about yemen, he would recover . "

hungary " humanizing " communism after the revolutions of 1848
swept the continent, hungarian patriot lajos kossuth said that his
countrymen were the " reddest republicans in europe . " today, seven
years after russian tanks crushed the hungarian revolt, hungary's 14
million people are fast becoming europe's most republican reds .
western influences pop up everywhere throughout the country . despite a
scarcity of eggs and meat, store windows display elizabeth arden
cosmetics, napoleon brandy and a selection of scotch . modern art hangs
on gallery walls, and newspaper censorship has been relaxed ; when
president kennedy's sisters, pat lawford and jean smith, visited
budapest, television and radio crews dogged their footsteps .
restrictions against travel to the west have been eased ; long lines
of visa applicants daily queue up outside western embassies in
budapest, and it is now chic for vacationing hungarian couples to agree
to meet in venice . hungary's new look is largely the result of efforts
by premier janos kadar to wipe out the stain of having personally
called in russian troops and tanks to suppress the 1956 revolution .
having found that a lighter yoke yields greater economic prosperity and
less political unrest, kadar has made hungary next to poland the most
liberal of the satellite regimes . that, of course, is still very much
a relative matter, but hungarians are grateful for small favors . "
times can never be the same again, " says one . " the revolt was not in
vain . " subtle revision.kadar's new stance has had a favorable effect
at the u.n., which since 1956 has refused to approve or disapprove the
credentials of kadar's u.n . delegates (though they actually take part
in debates and vote) . the final trace of u.n . disapproval disappeared
recently when secretary-general u thant spent three days in hungary and
seven hours with kadar himself . even the u.s., unable to round up
continued support to block hungarian accreditation, will not oppose the
official seating of hungary's delegation at the next general assembly
session . aiming to " humanize communism, " kadar has sacked stalinist
political hacks, appointed non-communists to cabinet posts, and allowed
nonparty members to serve in the parliament . he has granted amnesty to
thousands of political prisoners and encouraged refugees who fled in
1956 to return with free pardons ; today the government claims that
more than one-third of 1956's 200,000 refugees have come back home .
worker membership in the communist party is not a sure guarantee of
success . " we are not going to give red bloods the same privilege once
enjoyed by bluebloods, " says kadar . travel restrictions on u.s .
diplomats in budapest have been lifted, enabling them to go anywhere in
the country except to military zones . delicate negotiations are being
carried on with the vatican over the future of josef cardinal
mindszenty, who is still in asylum at the u.s . legation and whom the
government wants to leave the country . first signs of a rapport with
rome appeared when the government announced that it would approve pope
paul's assignment of six new catholic bishops to vacant hungarian sees
. but the government still refuses to let other bishops and some 1,000
priests perform their duties . off to belgrade . more than 90 per cent
of hungarian agriculture has been collectivized, but farmers can use
state machinery to cultivate their own tiny plots . increasingly, the
government is trying to channel a larger part of the economy into the
production of consumer goods . today some hungarian gypsies actually
have tv sets though they often go around barefoot . hungary, of course,
is still a totalitarian state . watchtowers, minefields and barbed-wire
seal off the country from the west . though the midnight knock by the
secret police is almost a thing of the past, more than 40,000 russian
troops and the hideous memory of 1956 still remain . kadar steadfastly
follows every new twist of kremlin policy . no sooner had nikita
khrushchev left yugoslavia after making his peace with marshal tito
than kadar made plans to visit belgrade this week, seeking to
strengthen hungary's economic, diplomatic and cultural ties with the
onetime " revisionist " bad boy of the satellites . never in hungary .
but kadar's liberalization does permit hungarians to laugh at
themselves and at their regime as long as communist ideology itself is
not attacked . in the latest issue of the hungarian satirical weekly
ludas matyi, the editors reflect on britain's recent $7,000,000 mail
train robbery and conclude that it could never have happened in hungary
. " we lack all the requirements for it, " said the magazine . " first,
of the 30 men in the gang, at least four would have been out sick,
eight would have gone by mistake to another railway embankment, and
three would have telegraphed from lake balaton that they could not come
for two days . it would also not have been possible to cover the green
track signal because we still have a cover shortage . in addition, a
mail train here would have been two hours late . the bandits loaded the
money they stole in a truck . they could do that in england, but here,
where the truck service stations are three months behind in their work,
what could they have loaded the bags on ? /

pakistan whose ally ? as u.s . under secretary of state george
ball flew in to rawalpindi last week to express chagrin over pakistan's
budding friendship with red china, he got a quick and bitter taste of
the nation's new mood . no fewer than five chinese communist
delegations including poets, pingpong players and trade officials were
getting the welcome treatment from pakistani officials . gleefully, the
pakistan press trumpeted the words of one visiting chinese bard who
wrote : " you are on the western coast of the sea and we are on the
east . the tidal waves of the ocean roar, and intermingled, we can hear
the sound of our heartbeat . " amid this heady stuff, ball passed the
word to pakistan's president mohammed ayub khan that the u.s . hoped
pakistan would not carry its palsy-walsy campaign with red china too
far . but all ayub and the other pakistanis wanted to talk about was
their preoccupation with increased military aid to india, which they
consider a betrayal by the u.s threat to pakistan's security . behind
pakistan's new stance is growing pressure on ayub by neutralist
pakistani politicians such as 35-year-old foreign minister zulfikar ali
bhutto . emerging from sessions with ayub and bhutto, ball declared
that " we have a better understanding of each other's point of view . "
it was diplomatese for a stubborn deadlock although ayub privately
had made
it clear that he will not sign any military pacts with china and wants
to remain an ally of the west, he passed along word to his american
guest that pakistan is not about to back down on the new air agreement
it had just signed with china . pakistan underscored its attitude
toward peking by announcing an agreement to survey the border between
china's sinkiang region and the pakistani-controlled portion of kashmir

congo bridging the past principal artery of commerce in the
congo was traditionally the congolese national route, a 1,725-mile
rail-riverrail connection from elisabethville in katanga to the
atlantic gateway at matadi . but the route became unusable with the
outbreak of civil war . whenever katanga's secessionist moise tshombe
felt events going against him, he quickly ordered another railroad
bridge blown up . thus, since 1960 most traffic has moved on alternate
rail lines through portuguese angola and mozambique . but the routes
across foreign territory soak up revenue badly needed within the congo,
and last week premier cyrille adoula hopefully dedicated a new railroad
bridge at bukama, the final rebuilt link in the katanga-matadi run . "
this is not only a bridge over the lualaba river, " said adoula . " it
is a bridge over the unhappy past . " though a milestone of sorts, the
bukama bridge also marks the petty pace of congolese unity, for the
steamy 25-day trip by barge and boxcar remains an awesome obstacle
course . some of the 23 congolese provinces created since 1962 claim
authority to levy import-export duties as the mood strikes them . also,
tribal tensions necessitate frequent changes of engineers as trains
pass from one region to the next . if the local folk spot an enemy at
the controls, they might swarm aboard and kill him on the spot .

france a man of europe flags flew at half-mast in brussels
over the headquarters of the common market . the tribute was in homage
to that grand old eurocrat, robert schuman . his death last week at 77
reminded the world that the new europe which charles de gaulle so
grandly purports to head owes much of its impetus to other frenchmen
with broader horizons . reared in lorraine while it was under the
kaiser's rule, schuman was a german for the first 33 years of his life
. when the treaty of versailles returned lorraine to france after world
war i, he became french (although he never lost his german accent) and
was elected a deputy . educated in the law, lean and tall with a
toothbrush mustache, the ascetic schuman was a natural for the finance
commission, where he served for 17 years . he ate cheap meals, prowled
his offices snapping off lights . a lifelong bachelor, schuman once
answered the door of his paris apartment wearing a maid's apron ; he
had been doing his own dusting . lone loss . but when it came to his
dream of the future europe, schuman was a leader among europe's postwar
generation of christian democratic radical integrationists . after
helping found the catholic m.r.p . and twice serving as postwar premier
of france (from november 1947 to july 1948, and for another brief
period later in 1948), schuman took over the foreign minister's post .
in 1949, after helping draw up the north atlantic treaty blueprint, he
signed the historic nato pact on france's behalf . in 1950, in league
with another french eurocrat, jean monnet, he proposed the " schuman
plan " for the european coal and steel community, which proved to be
the forerunner of the six-nation common market, and of the euratom pool
for peaceful nuclear resources . in 1954 schuman lost his only major
battle a drive for an all-european army (edc) . no orations . in recent
years schuman lived in semiretirement at his family estate, poring over
his rare books (among them the handwritten school manuscripts of louis
xiv) and penning his memoirs . intimates say he was " very upset " by
de gaulle's opposition to britain's entry into the common market ; but
he kept his silence . last month, felled by a cerebral thrombosis,
schuman rallied weakly, but remained bedridden . when news of his death
was announced, messages of eulogy poured in from pope paul, president
kennedy (he " combined vision with realism " ), and from de gaulle, who
acknowledged " the high conscience with which he served . " at week's
end, with no orations (at his request), robert schuman's funeral
service in the metz cathedral was attended by five former french
premiers. eventually his body is to lie in a special mausoleum to be
built facing eastward across the rhine .
afterward the five antoine pinay, guy mollet,
pierre pflimlin, rene pleven and rene mayer were invited to luncheon at
the metz prefecture by de gaulle's representative, minister of state
louis joxe . but the ex-premiers declined the invitation when they
learned that schuman's old friend jean monnet, who was also present,
had been left out of the party .

south viet nam report on the war overshadowed
by the political and diplomatic turmoil in saigon, the all but
forgotten war against the viet cong continues on its ugly, bloody and
wearisome course . the drive against the communists has not diminished
in recent weeks ; in fact, it has intensified . fears that the
buddhist controversy might damage morale among vietnamese troops have
so far been groundless . if last week's battles were any criterion, the
government soldiers are fighting better than ever against a communist
foe that is exacting a hideous price in blood in the flooded paddies of
the south . the biggest government victory in months came last week
near the town of gocong, 45 miles south of saigon . in the dead of
night, 500 viet cong regulars swooped down on a strategic hamlet under
a screen of supporting fire from heavy machine guns and recoilless
rifles . desperately calling for help over their radio, the defenders
fought back doggedly, but were barely holding out when a government
infantry relief column arrived at dawn with 15 armored personnel
carriers . ambushed by the reds, the government reinforcements did not
panic, nosed their personnel carriers off the road and into the
paddies, heading directly for the dugin reds . from a graveyard at the
fringe of the battlefield, a viet cong heavy machine gun knocked out an
apc . but supported by government air force planes, which swept over
the red positions in screaming, shallow dives firing rockets and
dropping napalm, the reinforcements rolled straight onto the reds,
mashing scores of the communist troops into the stinking paddy mud with
their huge steel treads . at last the reds broke and ran, leaving
behind 83 dead . mutilated bodies . the episode made no sizable dent in
the viet cong army . but it was heartening to u.s . military observers,
who on many past occasions had watched the government's troops refuse
to press their attack . this time the relief column had stood its
ground under the viet cong pounding and then moved in on the reds in
brutal combat . two days later, the reds evened the score . this time
they hit the rice-rich camau peninsula, traditionally
communist-controlled territory where government enclaves are only
islands in a sea of viet cong . the plan was a clever two-pronged
attack against the two government-held cities of cai nuoc and damdoi,
which lie 15 miles apart on the southernmost tip of viet nam . to
confuse government reinforcements and to hamper their speedy arrival,
the viet cong first feinted at three neighboring outposts, sowed mines
on a major road over which government troops had to travel, and poured
harassing mortar fire on a u.s . helicopter airstrip in the area .
the military front seemed a million
miles from saigon last week . four weeks after the crackdown on south
viet nam's buddhist opposition, an atmosphere of watchful waiting hung
over the city . still fearful of a coup, the government stationed
secret police outside the homes of suspect officials ; top military
officers were ordered to sleep at military headquarters so that a check
could be kept on their whereabouts . with the buddhist opposition
lulled for the moment, saigon's student population feebly tried to
raise protests against the government . pelted with chairs and desks
thrown from classroom windows, government troops closed many of
saigon's schools, threw nearly 1,000 students into jail to cool off .
it seemed likely that viet cong agents inspired much of the
demonstrating . this made it all the more important for the u.s . and
president ngo dinh diem to settle their differences . the latest
episodes offered little assurance of that . couching his words in the
most careful diplomatic terms, u.s . ambassador henry cabot lodge last
week suggested to diem that his brother and fiery sister-in-law, ngo
dinh nhu and mme . nhu, leave the country until the current crisis was
over and a fresh rapprochement
shortly after midnight, the reds hit cai
nuoc directly . pouring mortar shells and recoilless rifle fire in the
perimeter system of defensive bunkers, the viet cong breached the front
gate of the city's major outpost, ran from bunker to bunker lobbing in
grenades and shooting the defenders in the back . the fight lasted for
only 35 minutes, but the reds occupied the town for the next 17 hours .
it was a bloodbath . when reinforcements finally appeared, they found a
heap of 50 mutilated bodies, including women and children, which the
reds had set afire . of the 100-man defending force, only 25 survived .
experts differ . soon thereafter, the reds overran the neighboring town
of damdoi . but this time the communists made the mistake of staying
too long . seven hours after the viet cong occupied the town,
government marines, airlifted to the scene in u.s . helicopters,
counterattacked . half the marine force blocked the reds' escape route
and attacked their sandbagged positions . armed helicopters unloaded
some 80 rockets into the communist defenses, and fighter planes zoomed
in at treetop level with guns blazing . when the reds finally
disappeared into the paddies after an all-day fight, they left behind
60 dead   between the government and the population established
. lodge hinted delicately that the continued presence of the bitterly
controversial nhus in south viet nam not only hampered the war effort
against the communist viet cong, but could also " endanger " u.s .
congressional appropriations to diem's government . diem expressed
surprise and shock at lodge's suggestion, coldly turned it down ; he
might have wondered how john f . kennedy would have felt if viet nam
had asked for the exile of bobby and ethel . what next in u.s . policy
? it was a time of frantic pondering and frantic discussion in
washington . some of the suggestions were ludicrous : cut off all aid
to diem (which would effectively hand the country to the communists) ;
run the seventh fleet up to the coast and force diem out of power (also
senseless, since no suitable successor was visible) . no one seemed to
be discussing perhaps the most sensible solution of all : stop all the
halfway hints of encouragement to promoters of a coup d'etat, and get
on with the difficult and unpalatable task of working with ngo dinh
diem and his family . faced with a profusion of proposals for action,
president kennedy was keeping his mind open . at his press conference,
he refused all efforts to drag him into a discussion
the government's
marines were also badly battered ; 48 were killed by the time the
shooting stopped . on the basis of bodies, this might be called a
government victory . not so insist some american military men who argue
that such defensive responses whatever the penalty in lives to the
communist enemy are wasting the strength of the vietnamese forces as
well as the $1,500,000 a day the u.s . is pumping into the country .
these experts will not be happy until the government can organize
regular " search and hold " operations in the southern rice country,
communism's stronghold . it is an incredibly difficult task . though
the viet cong are losing more men (currently about 500 a week) all the
time, there are more to be killed ,; officials in saigon now estimate
that hard-core communist strength has gone up from 23,000 to 31,000
over the past few months . but government strikes are at least more and
more frequent . in the first week of september, 55 separate offensive
ground actions of battalion strength or larger were under way, close to
an alltime record . conversely, red attacks also increased from 300 to
400 in the same period . as this week's operations illustrate, however,
many government troops have learned to stand and fight .
personalities and said simply : " what helps the war we support
; what interferes with the war effort we oppose . we are not there to
see a war lost . that is our policy . " as if to quiet u.s .
nervousness, diem at week's end announced that martial law, which has
been in effect for almost a month, will end this week, foreshadowing a
possible return to normalcy in south viet nam .

blackmailing attacks, " she exclaimed . what about the concern for
south viet nam's buddhists voiced by the vatican ? pope paul vi is
too " easily worried, " retorted mme . nhu . her acid remark
supplemented earlier comments on the same subject on french television
: " as a catholic, i am only required to believe in the dogmas of my
religion and the pope . the pope is only infallible when he decrees
something ex cathedra . i do not believe that he will put himself in
his chair to disavow me, because that would be a very bad blow to
catholicism . " reports that she would not stay at the conference until
its conclusion left officials near consternation . " if mme . nhu
leaves one day early, d one, " then the conference will have lost its
importance . " but she showed every sign of enjoying herself . letting
fly at the white house after reports that john f . kennedy might be a
bit unhappy with south viet nam's whole ruling family, mme . nhu
suggested that the president was " misinformed about the situation in
south viet nam . " / he's a politician, and when he hears loud
opposition, he tries to appease it . " two days later she had lunch
with another delegate at the conference . it was none other than the
president's brother, senator edward m . kennedy . like others on the
u.s . delegation, teddy kennedy had halfway hoped to avoid the
confrontation . but they had a chat . a long chat . " she discussed at
length her side of the picture, " said teddy later . " she wanted to
talk to me . she wants to talk to anyone and everyone . " in fact,
declared an awed witness to the one-sided conversation, " she did not
stop talking from one minute to the other . " unable to get a word in
edgeways, teddy took notes .
it may have been this tart remark that partly prompted u.n .
secretary-general u thant to make some wholly gratuitous observations
at a manhattan press conference . conditions in saigon were " chaotic,
/ declared u thant, adding that " constitutional processes " are " a
feature which is completely absent in viet nam . " they are, of course,
completely absent in his own country, burma, which is ruled by general
ne win, as firm a dictator as exists in southeast asia but never
criticized by u thant .

south viet nam birth at geneva at 10 : 42 a.m., peking
time, wednesday, july 21, 1954, the war in indo-china came to an end .
the result had been a foregone conclusion since the ignominious french
defeat by the communist viet minh at dienbienphu two months earlier .
even before that, diplomats from nine nations, halfway round the world
in geneva, had been working feverishly to hammer out the final peace
settlement . fearful that highlevel participation in geneva might put
the u.s . in the position of approving a sellout to the reds, president
eisenhower and secretary of state john foster dulles were hesitant
about endorsing the conference . but when french premier pierre
mendes-france said that he needed u.s . support to avoid unnecessary
concessions, washington sent under secretary of state walter bedell
smith back to geneva to stiffen him up . . (bullet here) in geneva,
diplomats argued over how indo-china should be partitioned . when
discussions appeared to be getting nowhere, mendesfrance imposed a
deadline after which he threatened to resign a move that would have
brought the conference to a grinding halt and continued a war that
could not be won . prodded by this ultimatum, the conference finally
agreed on terms that would partition viet nam at the 17th parallel .
the agreement gave the viet minh the industrial north, leaving the
government of ngo dinh diem with the rice-rich south . new military
bases were prohibited, and civilians were permitted to leave one zone
to take up residence in the other (nearly 800,000 north vietnamese
moved to the south, but only a few thousand southerners moved north) .
elections to unify viet nam were supposed to be held in 1956, but diem
repudiated this with the argument that any election in the communist
north would be rigged . the conference set up an international control
commission of india, poland and canada to investigate all border
violations and arbitrate all treaty disagreements ; but the i.c.c.'s
troika arrangement stymied whatever effectiveness it had . . (bullet
here) in january 1955, the u.s., at diem's request, took over the
primary responsibility for the training of the vietnamese army as part
of dulles' effort under the seato treaty to curb communist subversion
in southeast asia . though the u.s . poured in lavish economic aid, the
total u.s . military strength assigned to the military assistance group
did not exceed 2,000 men . but as the communist viet cong guerrillas
began increasing their terrorist attacks against the government, the
u.s . started to get seriously concerned . in october 1961, general
maxwell d . taylor visited south viet nam, came back with the outline
of a vastly stepped-up program of u.s . military aid . today, total u.s
. strength in south viet nam is about 14,000 men . the vietnamese army
is almost completely armed with u.s . weapons, and u.s . army
helicopters ferry government troops on practically every long-range

france coping with an old foe the joke in paris was that charles
de gaulle did not know bifteck prices were going up until his wife,
tante yvonne, told him . wherever de gaulle got the news about french
inflation, he moved swiftly last week to bring it under control .
inflation is as typically french as are street demonstrations and often
the two are linked . all french governments tend to grapple vainly with
the problem . premier paul ramadier fought a game but losing battle in
1947 ; premier antoine pinay launched a " save the franc " campaign in
1952 . now de gaulle is struggling against the same hydraheaded enemy
: rising prices, up 16 per cent in three years ; wage boosts, which
only increase the cost spiral ; and the fury of farmers .
in an unusual move, de gaulle summoned his cabinet during the
vacation month of august, and sourly noted that without economic and
financial stability france could not have the glorious " policy
consistent with her interests . " premier georges pompidou, an
ex-banker, candidly said that all frenchmen were jiggling tax returns a
bit in their own favor, lamented that " while an american always wants
to demonstrate that he earns more than his neighbor, the frenchman
always wants to show you he earns less . " credit restrictions and
budgetary measures highlighted the new corrective plan announced by the
government last week . banks are limited to a 10 per cent increase in
loan portfolios . installment buying has been tightened by increasing
down payments . in a nationwide tv speech, finance minister valery
giscard d'estaing said the success of the plan depends " on two things
: conscience and confidence . " the press was neither hostile nor
enthusiastic . as usual, charles de gaulle had the last word . to his
cabinet he said, " if this doesn't do it, we'll go still farther . "

formosa little chiang when the united airlines jet
landed at washington airport last week, general chiang ching-kuo walked
unnoticed past the waiting reception committee of u.s . officials and
chinese diplomats . it was not until moments later that they spotted
him, a chunky man in a nondescript business suit, patiently examining
the modernistic interior of the dulles terminal building . the
committee's mistake, and the general's demeanor, were both significant
. though the eldest son of chiang kai-shek, nationalist china's
venerable president, chiang ching-kuo, 53, is the mystery man of
formosa who avoids the limelight . partly, the mystery has professional
reasons : as chief of formosa's secret police and head of the
guerrilla activities directed against red china, he naturally seeks the
shadows . formosan bestseller . the visit to the u.s., his first in
ten years,
is said to be without special significance . he conferred with
intelligence officials at both the cia and the pentagon, discussed the
latest estimates of conditions on the red chinese mainland . between
conferences, he squeezed in a one-day jet flight to cape canaveral . he
also had a 75-minute conference with the president and presented him
with a copy of profiles in courage in a chinese translation, adding
that it was a bestseller on formosa . kennedy and top u.s . officials
were seeing face to face the man who may well succeed his father as
president of nationalist china . on formosa, chingkuo is known as "
little chiang, " and his only major rival for the top job is vice
president chen cheng, who suffers from a liver ailment and has been in
semiretirement since june . born in chekiang province to the gimo's
first wife, a peasant girl who was later killed in a japanese bombing
raid, ching-kuo was 16 when the gimo sent him to moscow in 1925 " to
learn more about revolutionary ideas . " he joined the komsomol and
studied guerrilla tactics at a red army academy . when chiang kai-shek
broke with the communists in 1927, a letter over ching-kuo's name
appeared in pravda denouncing his father as a " traitor . " he says the
letter was a forgery . ching-kuo himself broke with stalin on the issue
of trotskyism and put in some years of hard work in gold mines and
factories . when the japanese threat forged a new bond between stalin
and the gimo in 1937, ching-kuo was permitted to leave for china with
his shy, appealing russian wife fanina and their son alan . spot & mop
. overjoyed at his son's return, the gimo nevertheless thought him too
russian in his outlook and had him tutored for two years to " make him
chinese again . " ever since, ching-kuo has loyally and efficiently
handled a succession of jobs for his father, ranging from operating a
concentration camp for communist suspects on green island to creating a
system of political commissars to check on loyalty in the army . under
ching-kuo, nationalist guerrillas probe the mainland for soft spots in
the defenses and public disaffection with the red regime . over the
past two years, some 1,500 men have been put ashore in chekiang and
kwangtung provinces . in u.s . opinion, individual saboteurs often
complete their missions, but most large raiding parties have been
quickly spotted and mopped up by the red chinese .
ching-kuo has repeatedly been accused of
engaging in secret talks with peking, presumably with the object of
making a deal after the gimo's death . those who know him best scoff at
the idea that he would ever hand formosa over to peking . sino-marxist
amalgam . with no formal university education, ching-kuo commands
little loyalty among nationalist china's intellectuals, and his
nonconformist methods irritate the top politicians of the kuomintang .
he is backed by his dashing half brother, major general chiang wei-kuo,
47 . as minister without portfolio in the cabinet and special adviser
to the president, chingkuo works closely with his father . another
source of strength is ching-kuo's 100,000-man youth corps, and his veto
power over promotions in the army gives him enormous influence with
junior officers . with his two older children married, ching-kuo lives
in a modest home in taipei with his wife and two younger sons . his day
begins at 6 : 00 a.m . with an hour's practice in chinese calligraphy
and painting, and continues in his office until midnight . he likes
hiking in the mountains, but since suffering from mild diabetes has had
to forgo convivial drinking mostly vodka . one old friend sees
ching-kuo as " an amalgam of the chinese tradition and marxist ideas .
/ what strikes most observers is his strange combination of shyness and
power . a chinese friend perhaps put it best when he said, " look at
his hands there's the man : coarse, tough,patient . " as his trip to
washington neared its end last week, the mystery man met newsmen, who
found him seated on a gold-embroidered sofa in the chinese embassy .
red china, said ching-kuo through his interpreter, is at its weakest
point in history and formosa correspondingly at its strongest . his
visit was intended to bring about " common understanding " between his
country and the u.s . did that mean there were misunderstandings ?
ching-kuo replied with a loud " no ! " even before the question was
translated . with a brisk, " that's all, " the interview was concluded,
and ching-kuo drove off to princeton, n.j., to enjoy the one u.s .
experience he had insisted upon staying at a motel .

mongolian frontier . suddenly, swarms of red chinese students dashed
out of the coaches and into the station, tied themselves with belts to
block the entrances . then, in the words of astounded stationmaster
prokop mikhailov, they " emptied their bowels and bladders on the
floor, in spitoons, and on benches . and the men's room was only a few
steps away . " cause of the messy melee was the discovery of
anti-moscow propaganda in the compartments of the 19-man red chinese
train crew and the 73 students aboard the moscow-peking express . when
four russian border guards and customs officials tried to confiscate
the documents, mobs of red chinese defiantly blocked the aisles .
attempting to fight their way through the crowd, the hapless soviet
officials were pummeled, scratched and bitten ; finally they were
locked into a compartment for five hours . when the russians hastily
assembled a replacement train for the onward journey to moscow, the
peking crew locked the emergency brakes on their own equipment, raised
red signals, and moved cranes to blockade the rails . in the end, the
harried russians were able to force the chinese train and its
rambunctious passengers back over the frontier into mongolia, and with
a sigh of relief, soviet trainmen chugged off toward moscow in the
replacement train . it might well be the last trip in a long time for
the moscow-peking express . the kremlin dashed off a scathing official
protest to peking over the " provocative violation of elementary
sanitary and hygienic standards, " then peremptorily suspended service
on the route until further notice .

south africa a day at the stadiom one of the few ways that south
africa's hapless blacks and coloreds have to express their dismay at
apartheid it to boo vigorously the all-white home teams at
international sports contests . in 1955 the unpatriotic favoritism of
nonwhites at a rugby game with great britain at bloemfontein brought
about a racial slugfest that resulted in a tenyear ban on black and
colored spectators in that city ; five years ago, a similar clash
forced officials to halt a south africa-britain soccer match in
johannesburg's rand stadium . none of these feuds matched the battle
from which port elizabeth was recovering last week . there 50,000 white
fans were on hand to watch south africa's springboks face australia in
the final match of this year's rugger world series ; south africa,
which has held the championship for nearly 50 years, was behind two
games to one . this was quite all right with the crowd of 5,000
nonwhites, which inside its segregated enclosure felt no sympathy for
the locals . with the visitors ahead in this final match, the nonwhites
cheered so loudly that the puzzled australian players were taken aback
. then, with 18 minutes to play, south africa bounced back to tie the
score and the black bleachers exploded in a roar of anguish . nonwhites
began pouring over their fence onto the field, hurling bottles and
bricks . police with drawn clubs rushed them, joined by volunteer
whites . a white farmer emptied his pistol into the air . on the field,
south african forward dick putter was cut in the mouth by one missile,
and as a bottle spun toward referee piet myburgh, a husky australian
saved him with a flying tackle . after play resumed, south africa won,
22 to 6 . the score among the spectators : six whites and 20 nonwhites
hospitalized, two nonwhites arrested, 40 cars in the parking lot
damaged from rocks rained onto them from the black stands . possibly
hinting that nonwhites may be barred from all stadiums, foreign
minister eric louw thundered that " active measures are necessary to
prevent this sort of thing, " which, he complained, " is giving south
africa a bad name overseas . " as for port elizabeth, the authorities
there decided that the wise course would be to sell no more beverages
in bottles and to double the admission price for nonwhites at future

nigeria verdict in lagos it was shock enough to learn of the
conspiracy to overthrow the government of nigeria by violence, for
nigeria has been one of the most stable of africa's new nations . but
it seemed almost incredible that the ringleader could have been the
bespectacled chief prisoner in the dock of a lagos courtroom last week
the respected chief obafemi awolowo . educated by protestant
missionaries and still a nonsmoking teetotaler, awolowo worked his way
to a london university law degree, served five years as the solid,
efficient prime minister of his native western region and headed
nigeria's opposition party, the action group . before independence in
1960, he was influential in drawing up nigeria's constitution . would
awolowo, a masterful organizer, really get mixed up in a half-baked,
amateurish plot to wipe out his nation's top leadership with a handful
of explosives, arms, and rebels trained in nearby ghana ? winks from
the dock . indeed he would and did insisted nigeria's federal
prosecutor in the marathon, ten-month trial that filled 1,400 pages of
testimony . witness after witness 53 in all came into court to testify
that awolowo planned to topple federal prime minister sir abubakar
tafawa balewa last sept . 21 with the help of 200 trained men, on the
eve of a state visit by india's jawaharlal nehru . a government witness
testified that on awolowo's instructions he had carried a check to
purchase arms in ghana . police claimed that they had dug up four
cartridges hidden in awolowo's backyard . although conducted with grave
decorum, the trial had its interruptions . one prosecution witness
complained that some of the accused in the dock were giving him the
juju version of the evil eye a wink . awolowo, denying all the
accusations, said there was insufficient evidence to prove the case,
and declared that some of the testimony was obtained under duress . in
a half-hour closing oration, awolowo frankly lamented that " the
invaluable services which . . . i can still render will be lost to the
country . " the judge, george sowemimo, who was openly distressed by
the entire proceeding, said he had no choice but to convict . in a
nine-hour decision delivered last week, he gave awolowo ten years in
prison for treasonable felony, just a bit milder than the 15-year
prison term meted out to awolowo's crony, politico tony enahoro, a few
days earlier . headless opposition . with the convictions of awolowo
and enahoro, the opposition action group is virtually decapitated . but
the party still enjoys the loyal backing of western nigeria's
predominant, advanced yoruba tribe . the clannish yorubas will almost
certainly reorganize to challenge the north and east once more . at
week's end many a nigerian was wondering how long his country's
delicate balance of regional rivalries, which has been the key to
africa's most admired democracy, could last . unperturbed, sir abubakar
tafawa balewa, a moslem from the north, went ahead with plans to
convert nigeria on oct . 1 from a british dominion to a republic within
the british commonwealth .
sir abubakar will remain the real boss .
the changeover will merely install a
ceremonial president as head of state
to replace queen elizabeth, who is

troops (already pared sharply from a peak of 19,000 since the final
crushing of katanga last january) are scheduled for departure by dec .
31 . the planned pull-out represents a victory for such intransigent
opponents of the u.n . congo operation as russia and france . chiefly
because of the holdouts' refusal to help share the costs, the u.n . is
$140 million in debt, and thant has not " a single cent " with which to
finance the peacekeeping force next year . shaky baby . but last week,
thant's scheduled evacuation was causing alarmed protest from the u.s.,
britain and belgium, which doubt the congo's ability to stand alone .

tshombe have vanished into the bush ; roaming bands of them stage
highway robberies and raid villages to guzzle the local beer stocks .

has produced a nucleus of disciplined officers, thanks to its spunky
commander, general joseph mobutu ; no longer are unarmed civilians
shot down at random in elisabethville . but the army's retraining
program is far behind schedule, and there are nagging symptoms of
anarchy to come . in an african nation whose three principal cities are

called a press conference, announced that he was turning the whole
decision over to the security council and the general assembly but that

americans abroad the magic word at first it seemed like
another in the long series of racial incidents in the armed forces . it
began one evening as a group of negro soldiers of the 557th
quartermaster company were returning to their barracks at the big u.s .
airbase at evreux, 62 miles west of paris . across the road lay another
barracks, housing the 317th supply squadron, where the airmen were
winding up a " g.i . party, " that is, a cleanup before next morning's
inspection . death at dawn . the negroes passing by were noisy, and
someone shouted at them from a second-story window of the supply
squadron barracks . no one knows who did the shouting . no one agrees
on what was shouted . but unquestionably, the shouts contained what
negro soldiers at evreux call " the magic word " nigger . rushing into
their own barracks, the negroes grabbed 12in . metal rods used to
transform beds into bunks and raced across the street . first there was
much pushing, shouting and loud argument . then a fight broke out,
lasting approximately 30 seconds . when it was over, six white airmen
were hospitalized with head wounds . none of the injuries seemed
serious, but at dawn airman first class robert padgett, 23, of
woodlawn, va., died of a brain hemorrhage . next morning the
quartermaster company was lined up, and the surviving injured airmen
picked out their assailants, who were all pfcs : richard parker of
eckman, w . va., edward spears of new york city, raymond bost of
pittsburgh, franklin waddell and robert burrell of philadelphia . the
arrested men were negroes, the injured and the dead whites . even so,
there was a debate at evreux as to whether or not the fatal brawl was
indeed a race riot . gung-ho look . both units are completely
integrated and in the same proportion about 17 per cent negro . and
there were grounds for grievances other than racial . the quartermaster
company, the only army unit on the base, must submit to a midnight bed
check, while airmen have only to report for duty each morning . as an
airborne unit, the quartermaster company keeps in rugged physical
shape, has the tough look of gung-ho soldiers . the men of the supply
unit have the look of office workers and the vanity of intellectuals .
one airman sneered, " you could take that whole army company across the
road and add up their iqs and you wouldn't get 200 . " at week's end
even more doubt was cast on the racial implications of the fight when a
sixth member of the quartermaster company was arrested and also charged
with homicide and aggravated assault . he was a white man, pfc allen
gernard, 18, of new york city, who presumably had grabbed a piece of
pipe and joined his negro buddies in the attack on the airmen .

miss malaysia last april, the pert beauty from the oil-rich british
protectorate of brunei fully expected to preside over the independence
ceremonies of the newly formed federation of malaysia . but that was
before brunei withdrew from the planned federation in a state of pique,
leaving malaya, singapore, sarawak and north borneo to go it alone .
brunei's defection not only left this week's joyous celebrations
without a beauty queen but it also took malaysia out of the running for
the miss universe contest . the beauty queen flap was low on the list
of last-minute labor pains attending the long-awaited birth of malaysia
. at the insistence of indonesia's belligerent president sukarno, who
bitterly opposes the federation, malaysia's independence had been
postponed two weeks beyond the original aug . 31 starting date, while a
united nations team investigated whether or not north borneo and
sarawak really wanted to join . hoping to influence opinion against
federation, sukarno began moving paratroopers into indonesian borneo
along his 900-mile-long border with the two territories . some
indonesian guerrillas even sneaked through the jungles into sarawak to
stir up trouble ; they were relentlessly hunted down by tough little
british army gurkhas, aided by halfnaked iban tribesmen, who hung up at
least one indonesian head in the rafters of their longhouses . fearful
that indonesia might extract further delays out of malaya's easygoing
prime minister tunku abdul rahman, the architect of the federation,
singapore's brilliant, shifty prime minister lee kuan yew, who regards
sukarno as " an international blackmailer, " swung into action . flying

ministers of both territories and brought them back to kuala lumpur to
stiffen up the tunku . britain's commonwealth secretary duncan sandys

was a danger that vietnamese and american families who lived in an
adjacent residential neighborhood would be hit by shells . so, well
after midnight, a force of 18 tanks supported by armored cars and 600
foot soldiers went through a complicated maneuver that brought them
circuitously to the palace grounds . at 4 a.m., from several side
streets, the attacking columns began pouring point-blank fire from
tanks, cannons, machine guns and rifles at the protective walls . back
came a murderous counterfire, everything diem's defenders had left .
first one diem tank caught fire and exploded in a tower of smoke and
flame . then another was knocked out of action . two of the rebels'
tanks were also destroyed . a chorus of cheers . with huge holes now
gaping in the fences, and the defenders scattering inside the grounds,
the way was clear for the final push . then suddenly, at 6 : 15 a.m.,
everything fell silent again . a rebel general, who throughout the
battle had been in constant touch with diem and nhu by telephone, had
called for a five-minute grace period to allow the besieged president
and his party to emerge . but no one came out, and the cannon firing
resumed, smashing windows, splintering doors, knocking chunks off the
palace walls . the riflemen, bellyflat on the ground, sniped happily at
diem's last-ditch supporters . the battle was clearly over, and 17
minutes later, by dawn's first light, reported time correspondent
murray gart, " i could see a white flag being waved from a first-floor
window on the palace's southwest corner . but there was more shooting
from the palace . then the white flag waved again and firing stopped .
at first cautiously, then freely, the camouflage-suited rebels began to
stand up, and a chorus of cheers welled up from the streets .
western-style, they fired their guns in the air, and rushed into the
sieved fortress . " after all their effort, the rebel soldiers decided
that a little looting was in order . merrily, they ran from room to
room, ripping down curtains for souvenirs, grabbing pieces of china .
one soldier grabbed a calendar that bore diem's picture, stuffed it in
his shirt . another made off with a two-foot japanese doll that he
hugged fondly to his breast .
the official story . forgotten for the moment were diem and
nhu . a few hours later, the ugly facts began to emerge . first, there
was the official story . a spokesman for the military junta announced
that the pair had slipped out of rebel hands during the cease-fire,
boarded a departing truck while wounded were being removed, and somehow
reached a catholic church in the chinese quarter of suburban cholon .
there, according to the story, both killed themselves at 10 : 45 a.m .
it would have been an incredible end for such devout adherents of roman
catholicism, which sternly condemns suicide . but, in fact, the
president and his brother were obviously murdered . according to one
version, diem and nhu, should have been sent abroad by plane ; but,
instead, they escaped from the palace, were found n the cholon church
by a troop of soldiers who arrested the pair and drove them off in an
armored car toward military headquarters . on the way, an order was
given to kill them . when the armored car arrived at headquarters, both
men were dead . " unofficial " photographs showed diem's bullet-riddled
body lying next to a personnel carrier, with a soldier leaning over him
. a picture of nhu showed him on a stretcher, his body marked by
bruises . according to the same report, he had been stabbed to death .
again the accusing voice of mme . nhu was heard from los angeles : "
any crime committed against the ngo family cannot be hidden under the
label of suicide . i affirm that suicide has always been considered
incompatible with our religion . " she also worried over the fate of
her three young children, 4, 11 and 15, but reports from saigon
suggested that they were safe . she added amid sobs : " if really my
family has been treacherously killed with either the official or
unofficial blessing of the american government, i can predict to you
all that the story in south viet nam is only at its beginning . " the
trung sisters . the reports of diem's murder that swept through saigon
left a cold chill among even the bitterest of his enemies . but for a
while nothing could cool the exultant crowds in saigon . buddhist
monks, quickly released from jail by the revolutionary regime, joined
the throngs . shouting students turned the town on end . the mob
smashed bookstores that had been owned by diem's brother, bishop ngo
dinh thuc, and by madame nhu . another crowd toppled and broke up the
statue of viet nam's reverend trung sisters, stalwart vietnamese
heroines who fought chinese overlords in the 1st century a.d . ; their
monument had been sponsored by madame nhu . at the national assembly, a
shouting anti-diem crowd sacked the hall . then carried diem's portrait
onto the front steps and shredded it . at first, the soldiers of the
military junta let the excitement run its course, then troops nudged
the
mobs off main thoroughfares, urging them to quiet down . they obviously
had orders from the nation's new boss,duong van minh, to avoid the kind
of tough measures that might make enemies for his regime .
oriental gulliver . eight years ago, general
duong van minh made a triumphal entry into saigon to the cheers of his
countrymen . minh's troops had hunted down the last guerrilla forces of
the dreaded binh xuyen bandits, a sort of oriental cosa nostra that
pillaged the countryside and controlled vice in saigon . sometimes it
was known as " the whorehouse sect . " so moved was president ngo dinh
diem by minh's victory that he kissed his general on both cheeks . if
sheer heft could help him run south viet nam, big minh would have no
problem . a gulliver among his country's lilliputians, he stands just
under 6 ft . and weighs around 200 lbs., has a pronounced slouch caused
from constantly having to stoop over to hear his countrymen . american
military advisers nicknamed him big to distinguish him from a
smaller-statured fellow officer who is not related to him, lieut .
general tran van ( " little " ) minh . vietnamese good-naturedly call
minh " beo, " or fat boy . prison to prison . born in mytho, 35 miles
southwest of saigon, minh graduated from a lycee run by the french, in
1940 enlisted in the french colonial army and was commissioned a 2nd
lieutenant . he spent most of world war ii serving under a vichy
colonial administration that did the bidding of the japanese invaders .
but in march 1945, when vichy surrendered the french colony to the
japanese outright, minh joined a band of defiant, lower-echelon
soldiers who organized heroic but futile resistance to the capitulation
. minh was taken prisoner by the japanese, beaten and tortured by
having most of his teeth yanked out . minh is proud of his dental scars
and today, when he neglects to wear his false-tooth plate, he smiles
just the same, uninhibitedly showing off his half-empty mouth .
released by the japanese after two months, minh duly reported back to
the french only to be jailed for his insurrection . he and several
other prisoners were put in a crowded, reeking cell with neither light
nor toilet, ankledeep in human excrement . minh " almost went crazy, "
was freed after three months, thanks to a fellow prisoner who was
released before minh and intervened on his behalf with the french
commandant . the friend : nguyen ngoc tho, diem's vice president and
the military junta's choice last week for premier . although minh is
universally deemed anti-communist and pro-west, the experience in jail
heightened his nationalism . however, after his release, he accepted a
promotion to 1st lieutenant in the french forces, spent four years
attached to the puppet regime of emperor bao dai .
in 1952, with independence only two years away, minh
transferred to the newly formed vietnamese army with the grade of major
. after a stint of advanced study at paris' general staff school, he
returned and, following diem's installation in 1955, launched his
guerrilla-style campaign against the binh xuyen bandits . he also
helped diem in his campaign to subdue two fanatic, rebellious religious
sects, the hoa hao and cao dai . after a second training tour abroad
this one at the u.s . army command and general staff college at fort
leavenworth, where he picked up serviceable english minh in 1958 was
chosen by diem to be the first boss of a field operations command to
coordinate the mounting war against communist viet cong guerrillas .
generals without commands . like many of his brother officers, minh was
to become disenchanted with the president's rule, which often cut
humiliating through their chains of command . once, without
so much as advising the area commander, the
president's brother, ngo dinh nhu, ordered an entire battalion
transferred 80 miles from cantho to saigon . minh protested privately
: " generals do not have power of command, therefore i do not command
. " he was also concerned about lack of popular support in the war
against the viet cong, but he took no part in the abortive 1960 coup .
in the end, however, minh suffered for his views, which ultimately
reached the palace . last year, even though minh was being pushed
vigorously by general paul d . harkins, his field operations command
was abolished, and minh was assigned as " military adviser " to the
president a meaningless post in which he was under diem's surveillance
talk with the pentagon . the downgrading failed
to diminish u.s . enthusiasm for minh, who impressed them not only in
military ability . he is one of his country's top all-round athletes,
excels at tennis, soccer, swimming and boating . minh used to delight
in running his 16-ft . motorboat up and down the saigon river by means
of a remotecontrol steering system, terrorizing all other river traffic
. one day, a few years ago, minh was matched against visiting general
maxwell taylor in a set of tennis doubles and later exulted : " we
whipped the hell out of them . " in the angry aftermath of last
august's " special forces " raids on buddhist pagodas, eyes fell on
minh as a man who might lead a coup . knowing that he was suspect, minh
took care not to implicate himself ; as recently as two weeks ago, he
showed up with diem at a palace ceremony . but within the past month,
minh participated in an afternoon's talk with a visiting pentagon
official in which the possibilities of a coup were discussed . the fat
boy suggested that he was not the man to lead it, if it came, because
he considers himself a weak administrator . minh evidently found his
administrator in aristocratic, french-educated lieut . general tran van
don, 46, acting chief of the joint general staff, co-leader of the
coup, and the sharpest staff officer in south viet nam . says one u.s .
officer of minh : " he is a very nice man and very tough, but general
don is more capable . " big minh may lack the political talent to
become the leader his country needs, but he has several important
factors going for him . for one thing, he is a career infantryman with
a bulldog face and a top sergeant's bluntness, yet is popular in the
ranks . next, he is clean of corruption or a pro-communist past .
finally, big minh is popular among civilians . he drinks so little that
one joke has it that a quart of whisky would last him a year . he is
married to a pretty vietnamese wife, has three children . he is a
buddhist who eschews fanaticism . said one vietnamese last week : "
everyone knows general minh . he fought the whorehouse sect . he is a
good man . /

italy " this ship is leaking " italian
democracy last week was staggering toward a political crisis that may
well prove to be the worst since the communists were narrowly defeated
15 years ago . on the verge of entering the government was a marxist
party that, at its worst, is openly allied with the communists and, at
best, is only a lukewarm and neutrality-minded adherent of the west .
seeking permission . when the original apertura a sinistra (opening to
the left) was engineered a little less than two years ago, it happened
largely because the long-ruling christian democrats felt themselves
slipping at the polls and generally declining in vigor compared to
their early postwar days . the solution advanced by left-wing christian
democrats, with the zealous backing of washington, was a series of
reforms in education, agriculture and taxation, all involving large
measures of government planning . since this program was opposed by the
rightist parties in parliament, including the free-enterprising
liberals, the christian democrats needed support elsewhere to be able
to form a majority . they sought it from pietro nenni's left-wing
socialists . according to the apertura agreement, the nenni socialists
did not enter the government but supported it in parliament . in the
process, some christian democrats hoped, the nenni socialists would be
wooed into breaking their longstanding alliance with the communists .
as it turned out, the apertura failed to accomplish that or anything
else except the unnecessary nationalization of italy's electrical
industry .
it also paved the way, at last spring's elections, for heavy gains by
both the communists and the liberals . since then italy has been ruled
by the caretaker government of premier giovanni leone . but both pietro
nenni and the majority of the christian democrats under aldo moro
wanted to revive the apertura, this time with the left-wing socialists
actually in the government . last week, pietro nenni turned to his
deeply divided party to get its permission to negotiate such a deal .
outside rome's massive marble palace of the congresses, 600 socialist
delegates parked their fiats, looking for all the world like bourgeois
conventioneers . but inside, suggesting that you can't teach old
dogmatists new tricks, the stage was bedecked with red flags and the
socialist emblem : a hammer, sickle and a rising sun . eyes grew misty
with tears as the affluent crowd broke out in emotional renditions of
the internationale and bandiera rossa (red flag) . spouting jargon .
today, said pietro nenni frankly, " socialist participation in a
coalition government is not a question of principle but of political
opportunity . " then he launched into a precarious balancing act . he
denounced the communists' " arid theories of power, " and urged the
party to drop its rule demanding cooperation with the reds in local
elections . but he did not as the christian democrats had wanted him to
ask that such electoral alliances be specifically ruled out . in
foreign affairs, nenni advocated a vague policy of " positive
neutralism, " which means unenthusiastic adherence to nato and
opposition to the u.s . plan for a multinational surface fleet equipped
with polaris missiles .
the powerful pro-communist wing of
nenni's socialists denounced the proposed coalition government as "
unacceptable to a working-class party . " the balance of power rested
with the socialists' no . 2 leader, riccardo lombardi, who only joined
the party in 1947 (before then he was a leader of the leftist action
party, which died in 1946) and feverishly tries to make up for lost
time by spouting archaic marxist jargon . he also made neutralist
noises, and unlike nenni, he hinted at further nationalization schemes
. still, while he denounced the " menace of capitalism, " lombardi
admitted that within a decade the capitalists might solve italy's
social and economic problems so the socialists had better get into the
government now to share
the credit and influence events . thus, in the end, lombardi threw his
support to nenni, but with so many qualifications that nenni might yet
find it impossible to work out a coalition with the christian democrats
. of 101 seats in the party's central committee, two went to
independents, 49 to procommunists and 59 to delegates favoring the
coalition . of these 59, however, 16 are held by lombardi supporters .
viewing his shaky victory, the aging (72), ailing nenni declared : "
this ship is leaking on all sides . " more moderate ? right-wing
christian democrats, who had opposed the apertura in the first place,
warned direly against taking the socialists on board at all . said
liberal leader giovanni malagodi : " collaboration with the socialists
signifies the abandonment of the struggle against communism,
abandonment of solidarity with the west, abandonment of a free economy
and an open democratic society . " u.s . policymakers, although they no
longer support the apertura with the same old enthusiasm, perceive no
such perils ; they argue that nenni & co . would become more moderate
as members of the government than if they remained on the outside
looking in . besides, insist defenders of the apertura, the alternative
to a center-left alliance is a center-right coalition which could not
command a majority in the present parliament without the votes of
monarchists and neo-fascists . many italian right-wingers actually want
the apertura government formed, hoping that it will fail, thereby
forcing new elections in which the right-wing parties expect to make
further gains for comrade palmiro togliatti, he chided nenni for his
anti-communist talk and sweetly urged both the socialists and the
left-wing christian democrats to accept cooperation with the communist
party .

dahomey        sounds in the night leaping from his bed one night last
january, dahomey's president hubert maga excitedly telephoned military
headquarters to report that his residence was being shelled . he soon
went back to sleep . as it turned out, the tough, jolly, former
schoolteacher had been aroused by the clatter of windblown coconuts
pelting down on the mansion's tin roof . last week the sounds in the
night came from real gunfire as angry mobs swept through the former
french west africa colony, located between togo and nigeria on the gulf
of guinea . in cotonou, the capital, and nearby portonovo, the ragged
crowds carried blackdraped coffins and chanted war songs as they
ransacked government offices, burned cars, hauled down the green,
yellow and red national flag from public buildings, and demanded maga's
ouster . bariba tribesmen from maga's native northern region leaped
into the fray in his defense and killed two demonstrators with bows and
arrows . finally the president resigned in favor of colonel christophe
soglo, commander of dahomey's 800-man army, who became head of state
and promptly suspended the constitution .
squandermania . it was
the latest in a series of coups that have shaken africa's new nations,
including dahomey's neighbor, togo, where president sylvanus olympio
was assassinated last january, and the former french congo, whose
president fulbert youlou was deposed in august (the ex-belgian congo
also witnessed a near-coup three weeks ago) . plots have been uncovered
in senegal, chad and the ivory coast .
the sources of trouble
are essentially the same in all the countries involved : moribund
economies, vast numbers of unemployed, strong and hostile labor unions
. in dahomey (pop . 2,200,000), the situation is aggravated by the fact
that it once supplied civil servants for many other french colonies and
boasted that " brains are our biggest export " ; now it has an
increasingly serious white-collar unemployment problem, for newly
independent west african nations trained their own government officials
. the dahomey rioters also denounced president maga's " squandermania,
/ notably the magnificent palace he built himself for $3,000,000 . on
the warpath . colonel soglo, 54, who has spent most of his adult years
as a professional soldier in the french army, included his friend maga
in the interim government as foreign minister . he is trying hard to
balance his government between the unions, which still howl for maga's
complete removal, and the northern bariba tribesmen, who are on the
warpath to win maga's complete reinstatement . though massive french
aid helped the new nations in the area to achieve a measure of economic
progress and political stability, dahomey and the other french colonies
are now threatened with tribal and sectional wars that could spread
disorder through much of west africa .

textile factory gave the workers a 15-minute break, during which twist
music was piped through the plant . billhatted men and shawled women,

peking's atomic program . it would be " several years, " chen told

crude atom bomb . but china is far from giving up its nuclear ambitions

nato the double standard only two days after secretary of state
dean rusk in frankfurt repeated the u.s . pledge to maintain six
divisions in west germany, newspapers reported that the u.s . has "
scheduled the withdrawal " of an armored cavalry regiment from germany
. sooner or later it may indeed be withdrawn but not for the time being
. anyway, the 5,000-man regiment plus five other regiments were rushed
to germany at the height of the berlin crisis in 1961 in order to
reinforce the six u.s . divisions committed to nato . these temporary
reinforcements would all have been brought back after the crisis eased
at a saving of nearly $200 million a year if the pentagon had been
allowed its way . but to placate bonn, the kennedy administration
promised in september that it would not withdraw any troops " without
consultation . " the furor in bonn last week forced president kennedy
to repeat, somewhat wearily, that the six nato divisions plus the six
additional regiments that are not committed to nato would remain on
german soil . the excitement over a single regiment is a symptom of
what washington calls nato's " double standard . " german fears are
understandable, but europeans in general, washington feels, expect the
u.s . to meet its nato commitments as a matter of course, while never
coming near to fulfilling their own obligations in the alliance . as
one u.s . official told reporters last week : " for a long time nato

great britain home in the highlands for the highland villagers
of perthshire, britain's prime minister last week put on the liveliest
show since bonnie prince charlie battled through their misty glens in
1745 . in dalguise and dunkeld, amulree and buchanty, and scores of
other grey hamlets and market towns, sir alec douglas-home shook hands
with shepherds and shopkeepers, downed a wee drappie with farmers,
popped into cottages, schools and smithies . the prime minister even
took a noble pratfall in the mud as he was scrambling up a haycart to
address the folk in sleepy dunning . " well, " he grinned, getting to
his feet, " it's better to fall now than later . " on the stump,
douglas-home seemed relaxed and slip-proof . to win election to
parliament from the safe tory seat, he raced through the glens in a
fast black humber, making dozens of plain-spoken speeches on topics
ranging from winter grain prices to east-west relations . wearing a
battered tweed jacket and a jauntily angled checked-cloth cap, he
fielded involved local questions with a barrage of statistics that
showed he had done his homework in the hillside cottage near comrie
that became the official seat of government during the campaign . when
heckling stirred an uproar in the crowd he was addressing at aberfeldy,
the prime minister calmly sat down in midspeech, refusing to let party
stewards throw out the interrupters . said he : " they are harmless
people . " as douglas-home put it, " the eyes of the world " last week
were on rural perthshire ; but tories' eyes were focused on a far more
critical by-election this week in luton, an automotive center 30 miles
from london where experts detect a swing to labor after 13 years of
tory majorities . as luton goes, said the pundits, so may most other
industrial areas where labor has traditionally been strongest .
speaking more to luton's floating voter than the faithful in perth, the
prime minister used every crossroads stopover last week to inveigh
against the labor party's " card-index, button-pushing society . " with
a socialist government, said he, " we would be like puppets on long

europe the wayward buss in communist east
europe, commissars and cops do it . in rome and madrid, moppets in
dancing class do it . frenchmen perform the ritual with sinuous grace,
spaniards smackingly, germans with a click of the heels . however
widely their techniques may vary, europeans from barcelona to bialystok
in recent years have taken to hand kissing with fervor and frequency
unmatched in their history . after world war ii, the custom seemed in
decline . but today, men of virtually every class and calling on the
continent dive for distaff knuckles as assiduously, if not always so
expertly, as do the courtiers in a lehar operetta . telegraphed
admiration . traditionalists deplore the trend and complain that it has
vulgarized a stylish, patrician ritual . in the old days, no well-bred
european kissed a woman's hand before noon, or outdoors (except at
garden parties or the race track), or if she wore gloves and not at
all, in most countries, if she was unmarried . nowadays, even in
strait-laced spain, girls who are barely old enough to hold up a
strapless bra have their hands out . when it is enclosed in a glove,
uninhibited males blithely peel it off or smooch the wrist instead .
and now that the hand kiss has become democratic, it is bestowed
alfresco, any time, any place, even when the recipient is on horseback
or in church . notwithstanding the celebrated advice of lorelei lee ( "
a kiss on the hand may be quite continental, but diamonds are a girl's
best friend " ), most european women welcome the new wave of hand
kissing, and to their men it has always seemed a more intriguing
approach to a woman than the aseptic anglo-saxon handshake . as a
viennese satirist wrote in 1825 : to take your hand for
a kiss is merely to ask this : will the mouth of the miss permit
further bliss ? to speed the answer, ardent latins, in
particular, sometimes telegraph their admiration for an attractive
woman by squeezing her fingers or locking on to them with both hands
all, cracks italian moviemaker vittorio de sica : " you've got to
start somewhere . " capitalist hangover . hand kissing got its start in
europe with the roman emperors, who exported the gesture as a symbolic
act of fealty . in central europe it ceased to be a pledge of loyalty
to the sovereign in the late 18th century, when austrian emperor joseph
ii snatched his hand from subjects' lips with the cry : " it isn't
there for someone to wipe his nose on ! " more recently mussolini,
who frowned on the custom in any form, tried to discourage il baciamano
. he might as well have tried to suppress spaghetti . the nazis also
deplored the handkuss good germans were meant to give the hitler salute
instead but der fuhrer himself was often photographed with his forelock
fanning some actress's paw . in eastern europe after world war ii, the
communists denounced the practice as a " capitalist hangover, " but
they soon despaired of curing it . after hungarian males, who have been
known to feast on a pretty finger for seeming minutes in a diplomatic
receiving line, poland boasts the iron curtain's most insatiable hand
kissers ; warsaw policemen routinely kiss policewomen's hands, and
have even been known to buss a comely speeder after handing her a
ticket . italy's communist boss palmiro togliatti is an accomplished
finger-smoocher . as for russia, tselovat ruku was outlawed by the
commissariat of hygiene in 1924, but today it is considered so kulturny
that an announcer who recently nuzzled a french actress's hand on
soviet television did not even raise pravda's temperature .

all capitalists are really robbers and cheats . communist delegations
from all over the world crowded into moscow for the 46th anniversary
celebrations of the bolshevik revolution . but nikita khrushchev
devoted a total of seven hours to a traveling group of 20 top american
executives (plus one educator) as if he found more challenge in their
company . on a european tour sponsored by time, the visitors first
called on k . at the kremlin . in the oval room, where the soviet
council of ministers usually meets, the callers sat in rows of small
desks while he answered questions from behind a huge barricade of a
table . he asked them to drop in at his anniversary reception the
following day, and they in turn asked him to a party of their own (he
promptly accepted) . throughout, khrushchev put on one of those
marathon propaganda performances at which he is by turns hearty,
earthy, funny, menacing, seemingly frank, and totally impervious to
argument . he sounded his usual note of ritualistic optimism, vowed
that in seven years no more and no less russia will overtake the u.s .
economically . to henry r . roberts, president of connecticut general
life, " he acted like a corporation president who is in trouble with
his board of directors and is trying to get out of his dilemma by
making aggressive and boastful statements . " murder at the wall .
apart from claiming victory in last week's berlin incident and
deploring the difficulties on the wheat deal (see the nation),
khrushchev suggested that russia had not really given up on the moon
race, at least not for the long run, and he almost teasingly hinted
that the sino-soviet split might be mended one of these days : " the
more you rejoice about the differences, the greater your disappointment
will be . " again and again he made a pitch for trade with the u.s.,
repeatedly pointed out that the u.s.'s allies trade far more heavily
with russia than the u.s . itself . actually, as these businessmen well
knew, russia has few gold reserves to pay for u.s . products and little
in the way of exportable goods that might interest the u.s . when
national cash register president robert s . oelman asked what products
russia could offer, khrushchev cited u.s . trade in machine tools with
west germany . " if we have managed to build a rocket no worse than
anything you have in the u.s., then i am sure we will be able to build
machine tools in no way inferior to anything the west germans can build
. " moving from foreign trade to foreign relations, khrushchev pulled
out all the " peaceful coexistence " cliches, lost his aplomb (but not
his temper) only when chauncey w . cook, president of general foods,
asked " why is it necessary to build a berlin wall and shoot people
down if they try to get over ? " / a state frontier is a state
frontier, " khrushchev replied . " and every state, whenever its
borders are violated, shoots the violators . " / not to keep people in,
we don't, " snapped cook . " in your country, children are killed in a
church for the sole reason that their color is different, " k . snapped
back . before anyone could make the obvious retort that murder at the
wall, unlike murder in birmingham, is an act of the government
khrushchev was off on something else
a new way to cheat . loosening up as
it progressed, the interview closed in an exchange of banter, with
khrushchev maintaining that capitalists controlled the u.s . government
. " who was mcnamara before he became secretary of defense ? " asked
nikita . " he was president of ford motor, " answered g . keith
funston, president of the new york stock exchange . " he's one out of
ten in the cabinet . why not talk about the others ? " / what was the
occupation of your former commander in germany ? " demanded k . "
general clay is now with lehman brothers, " said avco board chairman
kendrick r . wilson jr . " he's an army officer who made good, " added
funston . khrushchev raised a pious eyebrow : " you have 190 million
people . why don't they all make good ? certainly they have not
trespassed against god . " to wilson's assertion that the american
people, through the stock market, own much of u.s . business,
khrushchev laughed . " capitalists are very astute to have thought that
up, " he said . " it's a new way to cheat people . " he went on to
describe the " parasitic " state of capitalism, where the coupon
clipper " can live a life of luxury, drinking, carousing, or changing
wives, " then eased off . " i'm your host here, " he concluded, " so
please don't put me in the position of going into each individual here
and asking where he directs his activities and so forth, how many wives
he has . one of your fellow capitalists rockefeller is losing in
prestige because of that . " a sense of frustration . next day, the
jovial mood changed . at the traditional red square parade celebrating
the anniversary of the revolution, the russians displayed a squadron of
finned, 50-ft.-long rockets, which they insisted were anti-missile
missiles (the birds looked more like beefed-up versions of the soviet
sa-2 antiaircraft missile, and western observers thought that at most
they could be the equivalent of the u.s . army's nike zeus) . at the
kremlin reception later, khrushchev's toasts were so heartily
anti-western that u.s . ambassador foy kohler finally asked : " where
is the spirit of moscow ? i haven't heard any toasts i could drink to
. " but that evening, walking into the businessmen's reception at the
hotel sovietskaya (which had been refurbished and restaffed for the
visitors), he again was at his most amiable . sitting at a table,
oblivious to the massed diplomats and newsmen who were crowding in to
listen, khrushchev sipped " three-star " armenian brandy as, one by
one, the americans were guided over to talk to him . like the master
politician he is, k . remembered names, faces and business specialties
from the day before, even told a pretty secretary : " you wore a brown
dress yesterday . " he jokingly hit up rudolph peterson, president of
california's bank of america, for a $10 billion loan, with eugene
beesley, president of eli lilly & co., khrushchev continued a
discussion of possible u.s.-soviet exchanges in medical research, and
when he was reminded that a team of four u.s . doctors is in russia now
doing just that, nikita nodded . " good, " he said, " and let's give
them a laxative if they do badly . " he eagerly discussed
food-processing techniques with general foods' cook,
magneto-hydrodynamics with avco's wilson, and liquor with seagram's
edgar m . bronfman ( " our vodka is better than your vodka " ) . when
stock exchange president funston turned up at the table, nikita
khrushchev chanted, in english : " wall street ! wall street ! "
he seemed to regard the businessmen as doers like himself, and once
took a left-handed dig at communist inefficiency : " capitalists know
what is profitable ; capitalists are not soviet bureaucrats . " often
khrushchev returned to his theme of trade : " remember, please, that
you can always make a profit dealing with us . " but the question
remained : a profit for whom ? wall street's funston, for one,
concluded that the u.s . should not trade with russia, should do
nothing to make life easier for them . said he, in west berlin : " i

south viet nam : the new regime for a while, saigon looked
like a city liberated . vietnamese g.i.s guarding public buildings
munched oranges, bananas and candy, showered on them by civilians
grateful for the overthrow of the regime . pretty girls embraced
soldiers, draped tank turrets with garlands, scrambled squealing aboard
army jeeps . with the lifting of a temporary curfew and mme . nhu's ban
on dancing, saigon's long-repressed night life flowered as never before
. in bars and cabarets, the b-girls shucked the white, hospital-like
smocks they had been forced to wear under the morality laws, wriggled
back into their traditional slit skirts, or into u.s.-style slacks, to
twist and tango with viet and american soldiers into the small hours .
shops reopened, repairmen restrung power lines blown down by battle,
and saffron-robed buddhist monks emerged from jail or hiding (among
them : top buddhist thich tri quang, who had sought asylum ten weeks
ago in the u.s . embassy) . at xa loi pagoda, principal scene of last
august's government crackdown, thousands prayed . from poulo condore
prison island and other jails, 150 political prisoners were freed,
telling bitter tales of torture . two corpses . behind the first
euphoric reaction to the coup there was some fairly grim political
business for the crowd of generals who had accomplished it . the
officers under lieut . general duong van ( " big " ) minh first moved
to consolidate their victory . reportedly they executed the captured
commander of diem's elite special forces, colonel le quang tung, his
brother, the special forces chief of staff, major le quang trieu, and a
former leader of diem's republican youth . they also placed under "
protective custody " several former diem officials . in hue, the rebels
had no difficulty laying their hands on ngo dinh can, 50, diem's
brother and tough overlord of central viet nam . wearing tattered
clothes but carrying a valise containing cash, can sought refuge in the
u.s . consulate, only to be turned out after the state department
received assurances that the generals would allow him " due process of
law . "  the new regime's most embarrassing problem was two corpses
those of diem and his brother, ngo dinh nhu . the official talk of
suicide was obviously phony (see following story) . at the beginning,
the generals apparently tried to spare the brothers' lives, but after
diem escaped from the palace, the junta evidently fell back on the
philosophy of 19th century british poet arthur hugh clough : thou
shalt not kill ; but need'st not strive officiously to keep alive .
diem's eldest
brother, ngo dinh thuc, 66, roman catholic archbishop of hue, was in
rome attending the ecumenical council . another brother, ngo dinh
luyen, 49, was in london, where he resigned as ambassador to the court
of st . james's . diem's 92-year-old mother remained in saigon,
unmolested .
three strongmen . for the
living, there remained the task of putting together a government .
premier nguyen ngoc tho, diem's longtime vice president, appointed nine
civilian ministers mostly nonpolitical civil servants in the old regime
. to counsel tho's government, the brass named a 15-man " council of
sages, " including business and professional leaders . but it is the
military that is running the country . lieut . general tran van don,
46, the polished, french-schooled staff officer who helped mastermind
the coup, was appointed defense minister . major general ton that dinh,
36, the aggressive, vain commander of the saigon district, was named
minister of public security, which gives him control of ngo dinh nhu's
secret police . over both the cabinet and the " sages " is the rebel
officers' 23-member " military revolutionary committee, " which last
week decreed that " the legislative and executive powers are
centralized " in itself, and named general " big " minh chief of state
. within the committee is a twelve-man inner council, with big minh as
chairman, don and dinh as vice chairmen obviously the ruling
triumvirate . the generals promised that when " all democratic
institutions have been set up, " the rebels will " transfer all the
powers back to our entire people, " hinted at elections within a year .
in the meantime, as many political shades as possible will be
represented in the new government, but, said defense minister don, " we
don't want any neutralists . " before the week was out, the regime
lifted martial law and censorship . first to recognize south viet nam's
new government were malaysia and thailand, followed by great britain
and the u.s., which also prepared to restore a $12 million-a-month
import aid program suspended under diem . four tigers . the most
serious danger to the new government is potential rivalry among the
generals . the first hints of this were already appearing as little
major general ton that dinh injected himself into the limelight with
amazing speed . in the first week of victory, security minister dinh
conducted several press conferences of his own, and during one
interview, while protesting that " we must stay as one, " dinh
insinuated that big minh was really only his " front man . " but the
u.s . is betting that, for at least half a year or so, the generals
will stand together, and there are high hopes for a more vigorous, more
efficient pursuit of the war against the communists, with more autonomy
for local commanders than allowed by diem . said big minh : " our main
problem is to make the population happy . this and the military problem
are intertwined . if the population does not feel protected, it will go
over to the viet cong . " in the war, the communist viet cong stepped
up probing actions, but big minh & co . ordered a new corps commander
into the mekong delta, also replaced three division chiefs . said one
pleased american adviser : " they are putting some young tigers out
there . " red north viet nam's radio charged that " u.s . imperialists
schemed through the recent coup to replace the inefficient ngo dinh
diem clique by other henchmen who can serve more effectively their
aggressive war . " it was a handsome testimonial from the enemy .
on the phone .
u.s . admiral harry felt kept an appointment
with diem in saigon on the day set for the coup, a visit scheduled at
least a month previously . he and u.s . ambassador henry cabot lodge
stepped into diem's office at 10 a.m., apparently unaware that half an
hour before key troops had begun moving into position for the coup .
they stayed with diem until well past 11 a.m . as lodge, who was to
leave for washington the following day, took his final departure, diem
remarked : " every time the american ambassador goes away, they try to
pull a coup . " general don saw admiral felt off at the airport a
little anxiously, for the airport itself was scheduled to be seized in
just 90 minutes . don then went on to the generals' lunch . at 1 : 30
p.m . sharp, the insurgent force struck, with red-kerchiefed general
dinh barking the orders . don was assigned to keep lodge informed,
while big minh supervised the whole show . the generals deliberately
kept phone lines open to the palace and to the u.s . embassy . the
palace switchboard (saigon 21584) and particularly diem's direct line
(23126) buzzed with telephonic frustration . with the guard barracks
and the palace both under siege, diem at 4 : 30 p.m . called lodge to
ask for u.s . help against the insurgents . lodge replied : " i'm
concerned for your safety, " asked if diem and his brother would take
advantage of the insurgents' offer of safe-conduct out of viet nam . "
i shall do what duty and good sense indicate must be done, " diem
replied stiffly . " i shall try to restore order . " he hung up . at
church . half an hour later, the insurgent generals called diem to the
phone . one by one, identifying themselves, they asked him to resign
and surrender . finally, big minh delivered an ultimatum : " give up
in five minutes or the palace will be bombed . " diem stood firm, and
the generals, still reluctant at that point to risk killing him, held
their final blow . at 8 : 13 p.m., diem and nhu left the palace not
through escape tunnels, as widely rumored . they simply walked out,
each with an aide, and got into inconspicuous sedans . at that point
the rebels had not yet sealed off the palace, were still passing
civilians who lived on the grounds, and so the brothers managed to
drive through unnoticed . they rendezvoused at a villa in suburban
cholon owned by businessman ma tuyen, leader of the local chinese
community . diem and nhu spent their last night in the chinese
businessman's villa, actually took calls through the palace switchboard
so that the insurgent generals would think they were still there . late
friday night or early saturday, the generals called again and told diem
that his last hope of being rescued by loyal troops from outside saigon
was gone ; general huynh van cao, commander of iv corps in the mekong
delta and the last to hold out, had come over to the rebels . when diem
again refused to surrender, the rebel generals mounted the final
assault . the palace fell, with neither diem nor nhu inside . saturday
morning, all souls' day, the brothers went to cholon's st . francis
xavier church, arriving at 8 : 45 . they walked in, knelt and took
communion . the junta was tipped off by an informer . minutes later an
m-113 armored personnel carrier roared up to the church and the captain
in charge ordered the brothers to get in . at headquarters . saigon
still hums with rumors that diem and nhu were assassinated in the
armored car . according to the new government, which has discarded the
original version of suicide, nhu provoked the captain by insulting him,
and in an ensuing scuffle over a gun, both brothers were killed . the
government now calls this " accidental suicide, " and it is interesting
to speculate what u.s . reaction would have been if diem had put out
such a story about the death of some prisoners of his own . according
to the most reliable account, the brothers died quite differently .
they were driven directly to joint general staff headquarters, where
they were taken into a room with " several generals . " diem was handed
a taperecorder microphone and told to make a statement that he was
resigning the presidency . diem threw the microphone down and said : "
i will not resign . i am the president . you are guilty of treason . "
at this point, nhu leaped into the argument, cursing . one of the
generals backed away, drew a pistol and began shooting . the
bullet-riddled bodies were put back in the armored car and taken off to
st . paul's hospital . last week the bodies were claimed by a relative
of diem's, placed in hermetically sealed metal caskets, and taken back
to coup headquarters .

india under the banyan tree meeting under a gaudy circus tent in
the fabled pink city of jaipur, the leaders of india's ruling congress
party talked themselves hoarse last week in the first intensive effort
to refurbish their political image since independence came in 1947.
propped on sausage-shaped bolsters under a huge portrait of gandhi, the
dhoti-clad politicians pledged "self-sacrifice" and "democratic
socialism"--and at mealtimes roared off in fin-tailed limousines.
endorsing "nonalignment," party leaders warned ritualistically against
"entanglement with military blocs"- - even as u. s., british and
indian warplanes flew over new delhi in joint air exercises.  after
a six-hour debate on the definition of socialism, the delegates
adjourned the two-day conference and went home to give the subject more
thought.
boost for indira.  another subject they thought about, one that has
almost become a national obsession, is the successor to jawaharlal
nehru, 74.  india today is still smarting from the savage beating it
took at the hands of red china last fall, the economy is faltering
under bureaucratic controls, and the faction-riven government is
flawed with corruption.  restive politicians say bluntly that all
their problems cannot be solved by the stooped, careworn prime
minister and the elderly, out-of-touch congress party leadership.
a celebrated criticism of nehru is that he resembles india's
banyan tree, which proverbially kills every other organism that
grows in its shade.  in the wake of three parliamentary by-election
defeats last spring, nehru announced that he would ask a dozen top
cabinet and state ministers to resign from the government in order
to let them go to work revitalizing the party organization and
rebuilding its strength among the voters.  but the kamaraj plan
was really used by the prime minister as a ruse to flush out all the
top contenders for his own job.  there is even widespread
suspicion that nehru forced the resignations of his ablest ministers
in order to clear the way for his daughter, imperious indira gandhi,
45, widow of a backbench congress politician (no kin to the mahatma),
who has long been the prime minister's closest confidante (he
calls her indu, or moon), official hostess and political
troubleshooter.
ruler of the world.  but discounting indira as a real political
contender, the choice of most party members at present is former home
minister lal bahadur shastri, 59, an honest if colorless politician who,
like his leader, comes from uttar pradesh, india's most populous
state and the traditional breeding ground of congress party leaders.
if shastri is disqualified--he had a heart attack in 1959--a
leading contender for the primeministership would probably be
s. k. patil, 63, a right-winger who runs bombay with brisk efficiency
and until the cabinet purge coped ably with the thankless job of
food minister, though grain shortages prompted the crack that
he "gave india food--for thought."
morarji desai, 67, a stern ascetic who was nehru's finance
minister and was once a favorite to succeed him, has lost much of his
popularity in the past year, largely as a result of his draconian
measures to raise taxes for the defense effort, but could still be
the powerful right wing's choice.
as for nehru, he is determined to hold on to his post indefinitely,
but even india's most popular man occasionally faces the
limitations of fame in a country that is still only 24 per cent
literate.  in a survey of villagers living less than 20 miles from
bustling hyderabad, university researchers reported that peasants
variously identified nehru as "head of a german state," "ruler
of the world," and "some brahman."  named for kamaraj nadar,
former chief minister of madras, who first employed it to
advantage in his own state administration.

ghana  justice, black & white  no one more stridently denounces
south africa's violations of human rights than ghana's kwame nkrumah .
last week he dispatched a recorded diatribe to an anti-apartheid
rally in london, whose participants protested the law under which
south african citizens may be jailed for interminably repeated
90-day stretches . the very next day nkrumah armed himself with a
measure that makes the south african statute look pale by
comparison . since 1958 nkrumah has wielded a law allowing his
government to lock up any ghanaian without trial for five years, merely
by charging that the activities of the accused might prejudice
national defense, relations with other countries or security .
last week the accra parliament shouted through an amendment authorizing
the president to extend for an additional five years the detention
period of anyone held under the original act . the amendment
is believed aimed at 40-odd opposition leaders who have been in prison
since november 1958, accused (but never convicted) of conspiring to
assassinate government ministers and to poison the main accra water
reservoir .

greece  hubris doesn't win  for committing the sin of hubris
(overweening pride), the fates toppled the heroes of ancient greece .
last week greek voters defeated the most successful premier
in the country's history, handsome, hard-driving
constantine karamanlis, who had shown more than a touch of hubris when
he said in a campaign speech:  "the true political leader does not need
the people . the people need the true political leader ." during his
eight-year reign, karamanlis had, as he said, "transformed greece
from an oriental village to a european country ." he brought the nation
into the common market as an associate member, built dams and roads .
on the average, manufacturing has grown an impressive 8 percent annually
in the past decade, government reserves shot up by 400 percent, and
revenues more than doubled - - thanks in part to tourism, which this
year grossed some $90 million .  there are dark spots in this sunny
picture -- some 100,000 young greeks have emigrated to west germany to
find jobs, and poverty retains its grip on primitive mountain villages .
street peddlers in athens still haul sponges, bananas and chesnuts --
but they now walk beneath glittering neon signs that reveal the
internationalization of an increasingly modern economy:  ibm, siemens,
haig & haig, diners club . rejected advice . strongly anti-communist and
pro-nato, karamanlis welded his right-wing national radical union
into a powerful party, gave greece the longest stretch of political
stability in modern times .  but there were protests, when karamanlis
was re-elected for a fourth term in 1961, that police in the back
country had intimidated voters .  though many election brawls were
deliberately provoked by leftists, they convinced left-wing british
laborites and other allies abroad that greece lived under a tyranny .
last june, after
king paul and queen frederika rejected karamanlis' advice to call off
a state visit to britain because of the danger of leftist demonstrations
in london, the premier quit in a huff .  while karamanlis sulked in
a swiss villa for three months and a caretaker cabinet led by his
political allies ruled the country, the opposition center union party
launched an intense election campaign .  it was led by an aged
demosthenes, george papandreou, 75, veteran of several prewar cabinets
and the nation's first postwar premier .  to karamanlis' boast that
greece has prospered, papandreou replied:  "numbers prosper, the people
suffer ."  farmers, who had benefited least from the boom because of
low prices for their goods, got papandreou's easy promise that he would
forgive their debts .  above all, campaigner papandreou concentrated
on the old 1961 charges of election fraud, cried that he was
determined to save the nation from the "fascist and terrorist" policies
of karamanlis .  no thanks .  karamanlis, relying on his impressive
economic record, campaigned as though he expected the people to thank
him for running .  to the surprise of almost everyone, they didn't .
a near-record turnout of 4,600,000 voters gave papandreou's center
union 140 seats in the 300-member parliament; karamanlis' national
radicals got 128 .  winner papandreou celebrated by dancing most of
the night .  karamanlis was furious, hastily announced he was quitting
politics .  after a talk with king paul at tatoi palace, he changed
his mind .  after all, papandreou lacked a majority of eleven seats .
the premier could have a safe margin if he accepted the eager support
of 30 pro-communist deputies, but so far pro-western papandreou has
rejected the offer . between now and dec . 11, when parliament convenes,
karamanlis hopes to attract enough deputies to defeat the opening vote
of confidence, if he succeeds, greece will be in for new elections
and another free-swinging campaign .

charles de gaulle is making sheep's eyes at peking as part of his
strategy of the higher politics . he would like to revive france's

neutral north and south viet nam "free of foreign influences ." a

food for ten days, were given up for dead . the giant oil drill that
had bored the rescue shafts for the others was dismantled and started
on its way back to the netherlands . the crowds of reporters and
onlookers drifted away . all that remained was to hold a memorial
service . some of the survivors insisted that the rescuers continue
boring exploratory shafts, using a smaller drill . suddenly the
skeptical rescue team was electrified by a series of raps on the drill
bit . over a quickly lowered phone line, word came that eleven men were
alive in an abandoned gallery, 196 ft . below . memorial services were
canceled and the oil rig hurriedly recalled . there were breathless
phone conversations between the miners and their wives, some still in
black mourning dresses . food and tranquilizers were sent down .
chancellor ludwig erhard flew in from bonn by helicopter and made a

middle east danger : professor at work touring the
middle east under the auspices of the u.s . state department, duke
ellington and his band found themselves caught in the middle of a coup
in iraq last week . fascinated by the goings-on, the duke promised to
compose a new piece, " the baghdad rock and i do mean rocking with
rockets, bombs and all . " the duke might just as well write another
piece called the damascus reel, for syria, too, underwent a shake-up,
quieter but no less significant . behind the sudden shuffle of middle
eastern leaders was a power struggle inside a strange new political
force, the baath (renaissance) party, which in little less than a year
has turned from a shadowy, clandestine movement without popular support
into a dynamic power challenging gamal abdel nasser for leadership of
the arab world . the avowed aim of baath is to unite iraq and syria,
which it already controls, and to add all other arab countries to this
union, through persuasion or subversion . last week's tussles were
caused partly by the clash of ambitions within the party, partly by
differences over how quickly and radically the baath aims should be
pursued . out of the shadows . in syria, premier salah bitar, 52, a
co-founder of the baath party, resigned after being accused in party
councils of " self-isolation from the masses . " translation : he must
make way for an ambitious, younger rival . the rival : amin hafez, 42,
syrian commander in chief and a top party leader, who took over as
premier . as a prelude to his swearingin, jets whooshed overhead in
salute and to discourage any possible trouble . in iraq, the struggle
was between burly vice premier ali saleh saadi, a radical, and a
faction of moderates headed by foreign minister talib shabib and
interior minister hazim jawad . saadi and his friends want more or less
instant socialization of the iraqi economy, crackdown on the middle
class, revolution throughout the arab world, and an anti-western policy
. shabib, jawad & co . favor a slower, more conciliatory course . at
first it looked like a clear victory for the moderates . backed by
gun-toting aides, shabib and jawad seized saadi and three other cabinet
ministers, bundled them into a military plane without luggage and flew
them to exile in madrid where saadi kept hinting that he would yet
return to iraq in triumph . next morning saadi's supporters in the
labor unions and the national guard poured into the streets of baghdad,
led by air force colonel munzer wandari, a fiercely mustachioed fanatic
who personally took up a jet fighter and strafed the presidential
palace with rockets . when the moderates called on the army for help,
troops cleared the streets and jailed wandari . but he had apparently
made his point . an emergency meeting of the baath high command decided
upon a plague-on-both-your-houses gesture : shabib, jawad and five
aides were hustled into another plane and sent into exile too in beirut
. strangely silent in the uproar was the one non-baathist in a position
of power, iraq's president abdul salam aref, who was reportedly under
palace arrest . until party elections are held some time next year,
iraq will apparently be run by the baath central committee (which
includes a jordanian, a lebanese and a kuwaiti as well as iraqi and
syrian generals) and by michel aflak, the secretary-general and real
power in the party . it was the first time that aflak, a withdrawn,
seemingly gentle intellectual who has sanctioned the executions of
hundreds of political opponents, emerged from his shadowy position
behind the scenes . national families . what precisely is baath ?
nasser seems to consider it an even greater threat than his old
enemies, the arab monarchies of jordan and saudi arabia, and complains
: " i have read every book by or about baath and i could understand
nothing . " a western diplomat describes it as an " arab cosa nostra .
/ on the contrary, one knowledgeable observer thinks baath " is
probably ahead of its time reformist, progressive and secular in a
world of arabs bound by tradition, religion and narrow, personal
interest . " founder aflak, 53, whose scholarly manner has won him the
nickname " the professor, " defines baath through his career as much as
through his words born in damascus to the greek orthodox faith in an
overwhelmingly moslem environment (aflak's father was a moderately
successful grain merchant, and his mother, now 75, is still
illiterate), aflak got honors in history at the sorbonne . in paris he
argued politics with other afro-asian students, read marx, nietzsche
and jefferson . he says, " i quickly found marxism inadequate, based on
materialism without human and spiritual values, without national
consciousness . nations are only large families, and the arab family
needs more than marx . thus we evolved the baathist doctrine of
socialism mingled with nationalism and the human spirit . " returning
to damascus as a teacher, aflak was soon indoctrinating students in his
revolutionary ideals, drawing support from those who were overeducated,
unemployed sons of the poor . in 1942, after leading a strike against
fench history texts being used in syrian schools, he quit teaching and
became a fulltime agitator, drawing support from those who, like
himself, were overeducated, underemployed sons of peasants and workers
. the luminous classical arabic of his political tracts fills baathists
with ecstasy, but in english translation, his ideas seem rather murky
: " nationalism is love before everything else " ; " revolution is
the opposition of truth to the existing situation . " aflak wrote
baath's democratic-sounding constitution in five days, and it has never
since been changed or, for that matter, implemented .
by 1947, after the french left
syria, baath had 1,000 carefully selected members, and aflak called the
first national congress in a damascus cafe . two years later he was
strong enough to help topple a syrian government and served in the
cabinet for three months before resigning on the ground that he was of
more value to baath outside the government than in it . colliding
ambitions . aflak was profoundly shaken by the 1948 arab defeat in
palestine . during the fighting he prowled the front, living with arab
troops . " the arab social structure was responsible for the disaster,
/ he says . " a society based on disunity and inequality prevented the
arabs from reaching their full potential . " today he is as vocal as
any arab leader about driving the israelis into the sea . at first,
baath worked willingly with nasser . at the third party congress in
1956, baath decided on the union of syria with egypt that was
accomplished two years later . but the rival ambitions of nasser and
baath collided . syria broke away from egypt in 1961 and became a
baath-dominated state after a military coup last march . baath had
already won bloody control of iraq a month earlier and televised the
gory scene of the execution of dictator kassem . since then, baath has
successfully and bloodily put down two nasserite insurrections in iraq
and five in syria, and its leaders are understandably bitter about
nasser . says one : " we loved him and cherished him, the bastard .
nasser is a lost prophet . he tries to annihilate us, the devil . we
are idealists and don't want to kill, but he makes us kill . we have to
use his tactics, damn him . " the egyptian press and radio in turn
picture aflak as a combination of robespierre, stalin, ben-gurion and
the pope . whenever cairo radio mentions him, it is followed by the
interjection " yani, yani " (i mean, i mean), gibing at the fuzziness
of his political concepts . total hostility . baath depends on 50,000
party members scattered in eightman cells throughout the arab world . "
we could take in thousands more, " aflak boasts, " but we must screen
out opportunists, idlers and enemy agents . " not only nasser, but also
arab monarchs, businessmen and the traditional, middle-class
politicians detest baath . arab christians fear being submerged in a
united arab state . the kurdish tribesmen, who are moslems but not
arabs, have waged a long, bitter war for autonomy in northern iraq .
originally, the communists were numbered among the many foes of baath,
and in iraq were hunted down and executed, while moscow railed against
/ baathist genocide . " but recently, perhaps in a search for allies, a
baath official in iraq announced that " the red hunt is over, " and
hundreds of communists were released from jail . communist leaders are
joining baath in calling for " the liquidation of feudalism, " and the
baath party newspaper proclaims " total hostility gainst capitalism . "
still betting that iraq and syria, while anti-western, will remain
anti-communist, the u.s . this year is supplying credits and loans of
more than $60 million . in taking over, baath found both countries
nearly bankrupt and has tried to revive the economy with socialist
cure-alls ranging from nationalization of industry (including, in
syria, the advertising business) to converting state land into farm
collectives . for strategic reasons, a paved highway from baghdad to
damascus is being pushed to completion . this year's rich cotton
harvest promises a $100 million windfall for syria, and iraq's coffers
are being refilled by oil revenues . brainwashing . as set up by aflak,
the organization of baath resembles that of the communist party . each
cell elects a leader, cell leaders elect district chiefs and so on, up
to the various regional congresses . over them stands the powerful
central committee, which really runs the whole show . in dealing with
political opponents, baath tends to rely on the firing squad, but baath
meetings are conducted strictly by robert's rules of order . membership
is gained only after a minimum of two years as a candidate " on trial
for sincerity and intensity . " baathism is being extended to the
syrian and iraqi armies in addition to military duty each soldier must
spend two hours a day being politically indoctrinated . baathist police
officials are now trying their hand at brainwashing political
prisoners, and boast that they have even converted communists . as last
week proved, baath can be as hard on its own leaders as on its enemies
. michel aflak, as secretary-general of the baath central committee,
has survived as the only stable element in baath . he has never made a
radio or tv speech, seldom appears in public, but he is a virtuoso in
man-to-man discussions, and premiers, cabinet members and generals
dutifully report to him for " advice . " in fact, many of the decisions
in last week's wholesale firings of baath leaders were hammered out in
aflak's modest, four-room damascus apartment, with wash flapping on the
balcony and his two small children playing underfoot until the crisis
forced him to fly to baghdad and take charge personally . he was
plainly reluctant to do so . " i stay away from power, " he says . " i
am incapable of governing . " aflak is confident of accomplishing all
his visionary goals in his own lifetime . says he : " we have many
intellectuals in the party, but not enough executive and technical
talent . we need more trained cadres . we need more funds . we need
more time . we need more of everything . " the major problem is whether
baath's old arab enemies and new communist allies as well as its own
impatient radicals will allow the party the time it needs . meanwhile,
does aflak ever have nightmares about baath's victims ? he says : "
we only dream about our destiny . /

cold war how much trade with the reds ? no one knows better
than moscow that trade is a weapon in the cold war . " with every
additional shovel of coal, with every additional load of oil obtained
through foreign help, " old bolshevik lev kamenev once predicted, "
capitalism will be digging its own grave . " faced with the continuing
failure of their economy, the russians may be forced to rely on wheat
from the west for years to come, but above all they want to get hold of
heavy industrial items including whole factories, which russian
industry on its own cannot duplicate for a long time to come . western
policy is divided on how to meet this soviet commercial appeal . some
believe that trade with the red bloc may have political advantage by
making the satellites less dependent on moscow and possibly making
moscow more dependent on the west . others, notably west germany's
former chancellor konrad adenauer, feel that the west should trade with
russia only in return for cold war concessions . washington believes
that this policy is not feasible, if only because u.s . allies are
eager to trade with the reds, are scarcely even willing to rule out
strategic items that nato specifically forbids . western european
exports to the soviet bloc last year climbed by 10 per cent to $2.2
billion(compared with u.s . sales of $125 million) . what washington
worries about is not the sheer volume of such deals but the terms .
weakened willingness . the u.s . feels that if the russians want to
trade, they should be forced to use up their meager gold reserves and
not be granted what they want long-term credits . such credits would
release massive soviet investment for military needs and divert
free-world resources from aid to underdeveloped nations . under
secretary of state george ball last week wound up a tour of western
europe during which he argued the u.s . case for a unified, stiffer
western credit policy at least 20 per cent cash and the rest within
five years . ball received his friendliest hearing in west germany,
even though bonn tops the list of allied traders with the reds . west
germany last year did just over 1 billion worth of official business
with moscow and its satellites (including $422 million with the soviet
union and $213 million with east germany) ; no one can guess
accurately how much more private trade went on . though some german
industrialists were anxious for the government to guarantee long-term
credits, chancellor ludwig erhard ruled out the idea as long as the
soviets block german reunification . said erhard : " such credits
would strengthen the soviet position, so that its willingness to
negotiate would be weakened . " gentlemen's disagreement . in paris,
ball also got a sympathetic reception, a pleasant change for a u.s .
envoy these days . france last year exported to the soviet bloc goods
worth only about $266 million ; russian barter proposals, involving a
swap of soviet coal and oil for heavy industrial goods, are highly
unattractive since france can sell its own coal and oil inside the
common market . besides, charles de gaulle believes that trading with
the soviets is a dirty business (although he seems willing to trade
with red china) and recently denied an export license to a leading
french steel company that was all set to build a refinery in russia .
only in london did ball find opposition ; the british flatly declined
to join the gentlemen's agreement to restrict the soviets' credit .
britain is especially fond of the idea that more trade with moscow,
including strategic goods, will eventually pacify the soviets .
moreover, the new tory government is eager to reduce unemployment by
increasing output and shipping the goods overseas as fast as possible .
the plan has not worked so far : british exports to russia and eastern
europe totaled only about $310 million in 1962, and no big trade deal
appears imminent .

great britain into battle " i'm looking forward to this fight, /
said sir alec douglas-home last week . " i'm almost spoiling for it . "
he did not have long to spoil . next day, as parliament reassembled,
shouting, leaping tory backbenchers cheered lustily while the newly
elected member for kinross took his oath as an m.p . and moved into his
place for the first time on the government's front bench . pulling out
a small red and gold ballpoint pen, douglas-home hunched down in his
seat and scribbled furiously on slips of paper for the next 42 minutes
while labor party leader harold wilson delivered a cutting attack on
the government . like a poster . claiming that the tories' "
modernization " plans for new roads, schools and housing were borrowed
from labor, wilson said tartly : " imitation is the sincerest form of
political desperation . " why, he continued, " have we heard so little
about modernization in the past twelve years ? i never undervalue the
power of repentance, but it has taken a very long time . " amid cries
of approval and derision from both sides of the packed house, the prime
minister rose, nervously shuffled his notes and placed them neatly on
the dispatch box in front of him . " it's been twelve years since i
last spoke in this house, " he began. in the next few minutes it
became all too plain that the cozier, clubbish style of the house of
lords had blunted douglas-home's debating thrust, and his supporters
missed his usual pungent wit . after a long, meandering preamble, he
launched into a lackluster exposition of ambitious government policies
for the coming year . " the formula, " said he flatly, " is growth
without inflation, and the method, acceleration from positions
previously prepared . " groaned one conservative : " god, it's like a
tory election poster ! " twice sir alec even made the tactical gaffe
of referring to wilson as " possible later prime minister . " the tory
benches remained deathly silent while labor's triumphant roar surged
around the slight, pale prime minister . firmer ground . he went on
manfully, but again and again labor's uproarious barracking silenced
him for painful seconds at a time . he waded through the unfamiliar
marshes of economics, finally reached firmer ground when he turned to
foreign policy . staring coldly at wilson, who wants to abandon
britain's independent deterrent, sir alec declared that he intends to
make this a central issue of the campaign . once britain renounces
nuclear arms, he warned, " we could never go back into this business .
the government means to retain nuclear forces under our own control, "
adding that without them " we would no longer have a place at the peace
table as of right . " the cuban crisis, he said, forced russia to "
modify its tactics, " but " the communist aim is clearly still
unchanged . it is to destroy our way of life . " in cold type next day,
his speech read creditably enough . but on both sides of the house
there was agreement that the prime minister's eagerly awaited commons
debut had been a disappointing performance .
he sat in the commons from 1931 to 1945 as m.p
. for south lanark, was re-elected in 1950 but went to the lords after
succeeding to the 14th earldom of home in 1951 .

west germany remembrance two specters rose to remind germans of
events that took place a quarter century and more ago, but had still
the power to evoke deep emotions . reichstag revived . in west berlin,
the reichstag once again became habitable . a huge, florid structure of
silesian sandstone since 1894 the home of whatever democracy germany
knew from the days of bismarck through the weimar republic the building
had bulked vacant and lifeless ever since it was gutted by fire on feb
. 27, 1933 . the nazis claimed the fire was kindled by communists as
the signal for a red uprising, and a confused dutch boy named marinus
van der lubbe was beheaded for his alleged part in the crime . since
the reichstag fire gave hitler a pretext to gain complete control of
germany, most historians have concluded that the fire was set by the
nazis themselves, possibly even by hermann goring in person . the
reichstag was further damaged by allied bombers and by shellfire in the
closing days of world war ii . though many germans thought that it
should remain in ruins as a reminder of the past slow reconstruction
work was begun in 1958 . by last week the south wing, containing 45
offices, seven conference rooms and a presidential suite, was formally
reopened . it will take about four more years and an additional $12.5
million to completely restore the reichstag . unanswered, so far, is
the question of who will occupy it and why . the bundestag is unlikely
to leave bonn for berlin for fear of bringing cries of " provocation "
from russia . most likely, the reconstructed reichstag will stand empty
through the years, serving west germany and west berlin as a mute
symbol of the hope of eventual reunification of the nation .
kristallnacht mourned . all over west germany, ceremonies marked the
25th anniversary of kristallnacht (night of crystal), when hitler's
storm troopers went on a nationwide rampage against the property,
dignity and life of the 400,000 jews who had not yet fled their german
homeland . synagogues were put to the torch . thousands of jewish
stores were plundered and had their windows smashed (hence the night's
bitter nickname) . thirty-six jews were murdered and 25,000 arrested .
the pogrom had been inspired by the assassination of german diplomat
ernst vom rath in paris by a 17-year-old stateless jew named hershel
grynszpan. it was, joseph goebbels told hitler, a propaganda
opportunity equal to that of the reichstag fire . hitler agreed, and
the storm troopers were released for their " spontaneous " action,
while regular police turned their backs . both german television
networks last week filled their peak viewing hours with programs
mercilessly reminding germans of what they had allowed to happen .
leading newspapers devoted entire pages to recollecting in detail the
horrors of kristallnacht . said chancellor ludwig erhard : " we mourn
with the survivors and with jewry in the entire world . no man can make
up for the injustice that was done . " on tour in africa, west berlin's
mayor willy brandt sent greetings to a memorial service held at the
rebuilt jewish community center on berlin's fasanenstrasse . there,
heinz galinski, the leader of the city's 6,000 remaining jews (down
from 160,500 in 1933), handed out awards to " unsung heroes of the nazi
era, " 44 germans who had risked death to give shelter and protection
to jews .
ironically, it was discovered after his death that
diplomat vom rath had been an active anti-nazi . young grynszpan was
found guilty of manslaughter by a french court and sentenced to 20
years in prison . he was serving his term at sante prison when the
nazis occupied all of france, and his ultimate fate is still unknown .

japan two pins japan's disaster toll last week stood at 450 in
the kyushu mine explosion, and 162 in the three-train wreck near
yokohama . as far as anyone could determine, both tragedies resulted
from faulty cotter pins, only an inch or two long . at the mikawa mine
on southern kyushu island, a cotter pin apparently fell out of a
coupling on a string of coal cars halted on a slight incline . one coal
car rolled back down into the mine . gathering speed, it flew off the
track on a curve in the tunnel and struck the mine wall, showering the
fatal sparks that ignited coal dust in a vast explosion . at tsurumi,
outside yokohama, another cotter pin evidently sheared off the wheel
housing of a southbound freight car . the loose lost wheel caused the
last three cars to derail and sprawl across the adjacent track .
seconds later, alerted by a warning flare, a passenger train southbound
from tokyo halted on a clear track beside the freight . at that moment,
a northbound commuter train roared up the middle track . the locomotive
crashed into the derailed freight cars, did a right angle flip and
sliced through the fifth and six coaches of the passenger train . the
first rescuers recoiled from the carnage . recalled one : " there were
bodies piled four to six deep . there were legs, arms and heads torn
off, all bloody, scattered everywhere . it was a horrible human version
of a doll repair shop . " with national elections being held this week,
the socialist opposition hurriedly tried to make political capital of
the tragedies . an official socialist statement blamed the government,
which operates the railways, and the private owners of the mine for "
having placed too much emphasis on efficiency and profit and not enough
on the safety and security of passengers and employees . " the mine
owners, who used to boast to foreign visitors that the mikawa was an "
underground palace, " could have retorted that government inspectors
had found mikawa to be among the bestequipped mines in the country .
the government could point out that the stretch of track where the
collision occurred was equipped with modern safety devices but they
proved useless because the entire chain of events, from the derailment
of the freight cars to the arrival of the third train, took less than
30 seconds . few japanese had heart to enter the argument ; they were
too busy burying the dead and worrying
about the survivors . of the 274 hospitalized miners, an alarming 100
were suffering from amnesia . as traffic resumed on the tokyo-yokohama
line, the trains moved slowly past tsurumi and sobbing passengers
dropped bouquets at the accident spot . railway workers collected the
flowers and reverently arranged them on an embankment beside the track

the nations " how sorrowful bad " in halting
english, a moslem telegraph operator in the middle east tapped out on
the telex : " is it correct kennedy killed pls ? " when new york
replied, " yes, an hour ago, " the moslem signed off, " how sorrowful
bad . " as the shadow of the news spread across the world, it was
received everywhere with stunned disbelief . the empress of iran broke
into tears, as did the president of tanganyika, and countless anonymous
men and women . along rome's via veneto grief sounded operatic . " e
morto ! " people called to one another, and at a cocktail party the
guests put down their glasses and began to recite the lord's prayer .
wherever monarchs still ruled in the united kingdom, in jordan formal
court mourning was proclaimed . hardly a nation in the world failed to
order the rites of tolling bells and lowered flags . theaters and
sports arenas closed down on individual impulse . with the news of
kennedy's death, a viennese ice show halted in mid-performance ; in
belgium, a six-day bicycle race was interrupted ; in distant nepal,
the ceremonial opening of a leprosarium was postponed . everywhere,
bars, cafes and restaurants emptied long before closing time .
strangers spoke to each other in short, simple phrases " poor jackie, "
or " how awful, " or " it can't be true . " the phones of americans
abroad never ceased ringing, as foreign friends and acquaintances or
even total strangers called to offer sympathy . the streets in front of
u.s . embassies were jammed with mourners who stood in line for hours
to write their names in books of condolence . some brought flowers, but
many searched out an american diplomat merely to shake his hand .
monstrous act . one by one the statesmen joined the chorus of
commiseration . as big ben tolled every minute for one hour (a gesture
normally reserved for deaths in the royal family), prime minister sir
alec douglas-home said : " there are times when the mind and the heart
stand still . " from sir winston churchill came a statement : " this
monstrous act has taken from us a great statesman and a wise and
valiant man . " the words still seemed to carry the old, sibilant
indignation of the ancient lion . liberia's president william tubman
cabled : " the urn of grief has been opened and is being filled with
the tears of friends the world over . " israel's david ben-gurion only
asked : " why, why ? " almost by reflex, people rushed to disclaim
even remote complicity in the murder . " thank god it wasn't a negro, "
said a negro in toronto . many others insisted on reading into the
event their own political passions . statesmen in africa, asia and
elsewhere insisted that the deed must have been done by a racist, and
that kennedy was a martyr like lincoln or gandhi . and nehru could not
resist remarking that the murder gave evidence of " dark corners in the
u.s., and this great tragedy is a slap for the concept of democracy . "
golden boy . the mourning voices first of all were for the president of
the united states, regardless of his name or identity . for in a sense
far beyond daily foreign policy squabbles, he is to much of the world
the protector of the weak, the benefactor of the poor . because of the
changes in the cold war climate that occurred during his
administration, millions, even on the enemy side, mourned john kennedy
as a man of peace . but above all they mourned him for his person .
perhaps even more than his own countrymen, other peoples saw in him the
embodiment of american virtues youth, strength, informality, good
looks, the idealistic belief that all problems can eventually be solved
. a southern rhodesian paper called him " the golden boy, " and common
market president walter hallstein said that kennedy " personified the
most beautiful qualities of his people . " possibly more than any other
president in u.s . history, he had set out to charm the world, and he
had succeeded in convincing many a nation that it was his special
favorite .
it was the same in asia . in thailand,
authorities sent sound trucks into the villages to spread the mournful
news that prathanathibodi (president) kennedy was dead . in saigon,
people were more shocked by kennedy's death than they had been by that
of president diem ; and buddhists held special memorial services and
prayers . in japan, technicians were up before dawn to receive the
historic first trans-pacific tv broadcast from the u.s., which was to
have included a personal message from the president . instead, the
voice of a japanese newsman in manhattan reported the news of kennedy's
death . in all of asia, red china was almost alone in its determined
lack of sympathy . peking radio carried the kennedy story without
comment . the hong kong communist new evening post sneered that kennedy
had " used a two-faced policy to promote an imperialist war course . "
vanishing baiters . even cuba proved less surly than red china . fidel
castro deplored the murder, said he had no reason to wish for kennedy's
death, but conceded that " perhaps " cuba might have had motives " to
feel like it " and vaguely suggested that " reactionaries " were really
to blame . elsewhere in latin america, all the yankee baiting seemed to
disappear for the moment . a sense of pessimism about the future
gripped brazil, and the downtown streets of rio de janeiro were filled
with people whose tight faces, glazed eyes and unaccustomed silence
revealed their feelings . in the favelas (shantytowns) on rio's
outskirts, samba bands called off their rehearsals for the carnival,
and president joao goulart said about kennedy : " i kneel before his
memory . " the most eloquent latin american voices were those heard in
the street . a janitor in quito, who had been listening to the news on
radio, refused to read his newspaper because " it's too painful to go
over such a sad story again . " despite later revelations about the
crime, most latin americans persisted in believing that kennedy had
been slain because of his support for negro rights . in buenos aires,
women cried, " que barbaridad ! " , and old men made sad, futile
gestures with their hands . said one grieving colombian : " it seems
as though all the presidents in all the latin american countries have
died . " to the north, throughout canada, theaters and arenas closed
their doors, and large cities became hushed with a curious quiet .
prime minister lester pearson was just about to open a session of
parliament when he was handed a note . he threw it on the top of his
desk, slumped back in his seat and seemed at a loss for words . his
voice broke as he said : " the world can ill afford at this time in
our history to lose a man of his courage . " history's more precise
appraisals would come later, as would the resumption of all the world's
usual enmities . but for a brief time at least, the u.n . general
assembly, standing in silence, was in a mood to agree with u.s .
ambassador adlai stevenson, who said : " all of us who knew him will

south viet nam optimism at honolulu, problems in saigon in admiral
harry felt's reinforced concrete command post high above pearl harbor,
top u.s . officials last week gathered for the first exhaustive policy
study of south viet nam since the coup that toppled the diem regime the
nine-hour conference secretary of state dean rusk, defense secretary
robert mcnamara and joint chiefs of staff chairman maxwell taylor had
flown in from washington ; from saigon came ambassador henry cabot
lodge and general paul harkins . the honolulu meeting exuded almost
relentless optimism about the war, and the policymakers clung bravely
to the line that things should be sufficiently in hand by 1965 to
permit complete withdrawal of the 16,500 american troops . just in time
. one of the few concrete decisions leaked from the conference was a
hardly surprising agreement to intensify anti-guerrilla operations in
south viet nam's rice bowl, a wedge-shaped section of the mekong delta
from saigon south, where one-third of the population is concentrated
and the viet cong is strongest . another decision : to revise the
government's strategic hamlet program . all too often in the past ,
reluctant peasants were herded into bleak " fortified " villages that
were in fact insufficiently protected because they were too hastily
built . meanwhile the red guerrillas, who were supposed to be starving
in the no man's land outside the hamlets, managed to live well enough
off the land . henceforth, the plan is to see that all existing
villages are really defensible and more pleasant to live in, with
schools and dispensaries . as the conference adjourned, the war in
south viet nam was proceeding fitfully . new, aggressive commanders
reported several successful attacks against the guerrillas, but in the
delta the communists still seemed to have the initiative . vietnamese
officers and many of their u.s . advisers claim that because of diem's
military mismanagement, the coup came just in time to keep the
communists from gaining complete control of two disputed provinces
close to saigon . this may or may not be true, but the argument offers
a built-in chance to blame diem later, in case things should go
seriously wrong . no more siestas . in saigon, lieut . general duong
van ( " big " ) minh, the head of the ruling military junta, rode about
almost unnoticed in a black citroen (in contrast to diem's vast
motorcades), visiting a few government offices and military units . he
also opened promising negotiations with vietnamese sects that had
withdrawn support from diem but were not ready to rally to the new
regime . but while still clearly favored by the population, the new
regime seemed oddly reluctant to assume political leadership . one of
its few decisions : to abolish the siesta that has traditionally
closed government offices for 2f hours each afternoon . despite the
mournful yawns of civil servants, the new decree enables peasants and
rural officials to complete their business in the capital earlier and
return home safely before dusk, when the viet cong start harassing
traffic on all the roads radiating from saigon .

cambodia " balance of menaces " a chubby little man in a dark
blue suit strode into the sports stadium of the steamy cambodian
capital of pnompenh (pronounced nom-pen) last week, mounted the
platform, and began haranguing the assembled crowd in a whiny,
high-pitched voice . the speaker was prince norodom sihanouk,
neutralist, mercurial ruler of cambodia, and he had called the rally to
announce in effect that the u.s . was working to undermine his regime .
turning theatrically to the throng, sihanouk asked whether the national
honor did not demand that cambodia reject any future help from the
americans . when his subjects roared obedient approval, the prince
ordered : " so be it . " sihanouk might change his mind again, as he
has before . in a formal note to washington, he called for a halt to
all american economic and military aid, which in the past eight years
has amounted to $366 million . and so the u.s . already striving to
save war-torn south viet nam and " neutral " but tottering laos from
the reds faced another mess in southeast asia . shaken neighbor . what
was ailing the prince ? a suspicious, emotional, french-educated
descendant of cambodia's medieval khmer kings, he once performed
slapstick parts in movies (which he produced himself) and has often
played slapstick politics . friends seriously reported last week that
two contributing reasons for sihanouk's bad mood might be that 1) he
had been crash-dieting to lose 15 lbs . in ten days, and 2) the u.s .
transferred a former military advisory chief with whom the prince
enjoyed playing volleyball . the prince himself accused the u.s . of
supporting a clandestine radio, on south viet nam soil, run by the
prince's political opposition (the u.s . denied the charge) .
but, above all, the
prince talks of the " inevitability " of communist china's takeover of
southeast asia, hence may be trying to save himself by cozying up to
the red dragon . what precipitated his latest performance could well
have been the overthrow and assassination of his late neighbor, south
viet nam's ngo dinh diem . although sihanouk and diem were bitter
enemies, the prince was shaken by diem's death and attributed it to the
cutoff of diem's american aid . possibly determined never to get
himself on the same vulnerable spot, sihanouk moved quickly to lessen
his dependence on the u.s . opening to the seine . for all his
eccentric behavior, sihanouk has also sometimes proved himself a shrewd
politician . since independence from france ten years ago, he has
jailed home-grown communists and wooed his red-hot young leftist
critics into the government while at the same time maintaining warm
relations with russia and red china . sihanouk last week performed
another typically slippery gyration . instead of rushing right into
peking's arms, he turned to his old colonial tutor, france, and asked
her to help replace u.s . aid . said the prince : " for our country,
liberated from the u.s . and which the communist powers do not wish to
take in charge, it could be the hour of france . " the invitation was
another potential opening for charles de gaulle, who wants to wheel and
deal in the area of france's old indo-china empire (he keeps suggesting
a " neutralized " viet nam, hinted last week that france may establish
diplomatic relations with communist north viet nam) . but whether paris
will fill the gap to be left by the elimination of a $30 million annual
u.s . dole remains to be seen . france has been supplying cambodia only
one tenth the u.s.'s contribution, mostly to maintain a 300-man force
training the cambodian army .
at week's end the prince
climaxed his perplexing theatrics by calling in the press corps,
delivering a meandering monologue interspersed with giggles . proudly,
he announced that red china had offered him military support . " i
think i have achieved a balance of menaces, " he said . " the menace of
the imperialists and their lackeys is counterbalanced by the menace of
communist china, our no . 1 friend . " but he indicated that he would
have only four chinese civilian advisers and no chinese military
advisers : " everywhere in our army there will be only one power
helping us france . " added the prince : " i do not like to be a
satellite . i like to be free . " serving champagne all around, he
urged the correspondents to drink up because (jokingly referring to
impending austerity) " in a few months i won't be able to offer
champagne .

blast may well open a new rift between moscow and peking, even though
the kremlin has been relatively restrained in recent weeks . for as
khrushchev once asserted : " there is much in christ that is common
with us communists . but i cannot agree with him when he says that when

iraq
until the next coup for a while last week it seemed impossible to tell
who was up and who was down in iraq . perhaps the principals themselves
were not sure . two weeks ago, the baath party (time, nov . 22) seemed
firmly in control . the country's non-baathist president, field marshal
abdul salam aref, seemed a mere figurehead, kept on for his prestige
and popularity . then an internecine conflict erupted between baath's
anti-western, anti-bourgeois and anti-aref radical wing and a more
conciliatory moderate faction . rushing in from neighboring syria, the
baath party's home base, the party central committee under michel aflak
appeared to settle the matter by exiling the leaders of the opposing
factions . although syrian-dominated, the party leaders took charge in
iraq, placed aref under palace arrest and turned baghdad over to the
national guard, a baath-led outfit for which the regular army has
contempt . when the baath bosses overconfidently released aref a few
days later, he promptly joined with angry fellow officers to head a
coup . at dawn one morning last week, the army attacked baghdad with
six infantry battalions, supported by armor, artillery and jets .
though the national guard had no heavy weapons, they fought
desperately, lost hundreds of men . three days after the revolt,
baghdad was in aref's hands . since the baath party is nasser's
archenemy, the coup was at first hailed in egypt as pro-nasser . it was
also denounced in syria as anti-baath . both conclusions may be
premature . the coup looked more like a military than a political
affair, designed to purge iraq of baath elements who had had the
temerity to downgrade the army in favor of the national guard . though
he packed the syrian baath leaders off to damascus, aref included in
his new cabinet nine moderate baathists . still, the middle east being
what it is, aref may well join with nasser, an old friend, to overthrow
the baath leadership in syria . even more likely, the baath leadership
will try to overthrow aref . just about the only certainty in the
situation is that there is bound to be another coup, in baghdad or in
damascus, if not both .

japan vote of confidence for ikeda japan's new election
regulations severely limit campaign activities, but the country's
politicians are masters at circumventing the rules . faced with a
$7,000 limit on campaign expenditures, many a candidate in last week's
general elections simply followed an old practice of having
contributions funneled through " research institutes . " since
candidates were restricted to three posters each (v . the previous
limit of 12,000), many " accidentally " dropped cards, complete with
picture and slogan, in telephone booths, department stores, bars and
buses . on rainy days, one aspirant even had his campaign workers
approach commuters and hand out armloads of umbrellas ; when they were
opened, the candidate's name spread out in huge characters painted on
the umbrella surface . for all the uproar over procedures, the election
amounted to an important vote of confidence for pro-capitalist
pro-western premier hayato ikeda, 63 . the socialist opposition zeroed
in on the nagging inflation that has accompanied japan's phenomenal
economic boom . economist ikeda, whistle-stopping across the nation,
retorted that incomes have risen 52 per cent in the past three years,
while prices have risen only 14 per cent . at a kyoto rally, he asked
: " which do you think is better ? the socialists' advocacy of
dividing three eggs among four people ? or ikeda's policy of dividing
eight eggs among four people ? " on election day, amid the shriek of
sirens that reminded people to vote, ikeda's liberal-democratic party
won control of the 467-seat house of representatives for another four
years, although the government's 283-seat total fell three short of its
share in the old house . the socialists gained seven seats for a total
of 144 . the more moderate democratic socialists picked up nine
additional seats, for a total of 23 .

congo reading the russians' mail a couple of soviet diplomats
got the kind of treatment in the congo last week that many other
countries have often wished but not dared to mete out to red envoys .
almost from the day of the congo's independence in 1960, the russians
and their satellites worked doggedly to destroy what little stability
the country had in hopes of getting a communist faction in control .
expelled en masse after the demise of erratic patrice lumumba, the reds
began filtering back into leopoldville last year, notably to the
towering eight-story apartment building that is both embassy and
residence for soviet ambassador sergei nemchina and his 100-man staff
of operatives . two of nemchina's most important aides, his slim, fair
embassy counselor boris voronin and stocky, bushy-haired press attache
yuri miakotnykh, have developed especially close contacts with
extremists opposed to premier cyrille adoula's moderate regime .
miakotnykh worked hard to penetrate the trade unions and leftwing
student groups, even lobbied in the corridors of parliament . tug of
war . what worried the government most was the close contact of the two
russians with a plotting exile group led by lumumba's former party
chief christophe gbenye, who made his headquarters across the congo
river in the ex-french congo capital of brazzaville . one day last
week, when voronin and miakotnykh drove down to the river bank, known
as " le beach, " for the ferry ride over to brazzaville, adoula's cops
decided to stop them on the way back and find out what they had been up
to . surrounding their car at the landing stage, congolese police
insisted on a search . with a shrug, the russians opened the trunk,
then let them look in the front and back seats . but voronin was
clearly determined not to give up his briefcase, and hugged it to his
chest as he and miakotnykh got back into the car . to make sure the
russians did not try to start the engine and speed away, the police let
the air out of their tires, then pulled open the doors and began a tug
of war with voronin's legs, yanking his shoes off in the process . as
they pulled, miakotnykh clung just as fiercely to voronin, until at
last, both men were dragged out feet first, relieved of the briefcase
and heaved unceremoniously into a pickup truck . when one of the
russians tried to stuff a document inside his shirt, a congolese guard
ripped the entire front of his shirt off . out in the rain . with that,
the prisoners were driven off to a military camp outside leopoldville,
and the contents of voronin's briefcase were taken to police
headquarters . sure enough, claimed the government, among them was a
letter from gbenye to the russians asking for 5 billion in counterfeit
congolese francs to be used to undermine the congo's currency, and
another document requesting arms, tape records and " other espionage
equipment . " one of the letters bore teeth marks, as if a russian had
tried to swallow it . to put an abrupt stop to such soviet activities,
squads of congolese police were rushed to cordon off the russians'
apartments, and inside, the russians suddenly discovered themselves
without telephone service and without electricity, which meant they
would have to swelter in the heat without air conditioners and do
without cookstoves . two czech diplomats who drove up to the gate were
arrested and forced to stand outside most of the night in a tropical
downpour . from moscow came an angry demand for the release of the
prisoners, who, according to izvestia, had been arrested by police led
by " american advisers . " ignoring the protest, adoula's agents next
morning swooped down on the hotel room of another suspected communist
troublemaker, the newly arrived correspondent of the soviet news agency
novisti, hustled him off to a cell . he was later released, but by
week's end, the two russian diplomats were put aboard europe-bound
planes . usually hesitant premier adoula rejected his cabinet's
recommendation that diplomatic relations with russia and czechoslovakia
be severed . but he did order ambassador nemchina to get out of the
congo within 24 hours and take the entire 100-man staff with him .

south africa whose country ? for a nation dedicated to white
supremacy, the voting in south africa last week had an unaccustomed
look . black women with red-ochered faces fumbled with cumbersome
2-ft.-sq . ballots . their men, looking a little baffled by the whole
business, streamed up to register their votes for a transkei parliament
. it was the first step in prime minister hendrik verwoerd's plan to "
solve " south africa's race problem : the formation of black "
self-governing " regions called bantustans, where all of south africa's
11 million natives, except for a few million needed as labor for the
whites, are to be herded into remote and undeveloped reservations .
transkei, where the first bantustan legislature was being drawn, is a
denmark-sized plot of rolling land along the indian ocean coast, which
for years has been largely ignored by the whites . it is farm land that
through bantu overpopulation has been victim of overgrazing and erosion
. without heavy capital investment, it cannot support many additional
people . since the gold mines and industry of the white man's orange
free state and transvaal are far more alluring, there is precious
little chance of anyone's investing anything much in the bantu's
boondocks . preparing the election in this unpromising region (seven
other similar reservations are planned), verwoerd's police flocked into
the transkei to set up sentinels at each of 1,100 polling stations .
and to the illiterate electorate, word had already gone out about which
candidates the government favored . ironically, verwoerd's choice was a
black racist named kaizer matanzima, 48, a suave, handsome attorney,
who says : " all the whites must leave the transkei . this is our
country . " his opponent : wise, wizened paramount chief victor poto,
65, who does not want to see the transkei's small (16,000) white
community forced out, wants to set up a multiracial regime : " i am
grateful to god for a christian attitude to all members of the human
race . " in any case, verwoerd's widely advertised self-rule for the
native regions is largely hollow, since his government will retain
control over the police, defense and foreign affairs . all legislation
proposed by the transkei's new all-black assembly will first run the
gauntlet of numerous tame, government-appointed chiefs, and after that
is subject to the veto of verwoerd's own officials .

great britain another tory setback dundee, a dour, slum-ridden
industrial city (pop . 182,900) on scotland's east coast, is famed for
its marmalade and maverick politics . it has sent only two tory m.p.s
to westminster in 131 years, and in 1922 threw out winston churchill,
then a liberal, in favor of the only prohibitionist ever to sit in
parliament . in 1959 the labor party only managed to hang onto dundee
by 714 votes, and so, in last week's by-election, the tories had hopes
that the impact of a new, scottish prime minister might help to defeat
labor . instead, the government suffered another setback . the
progressive conservative candidate, a popular lawyer, lost to his
laborite opponent, a trade-union official, by 4,955 votes, a tory drop
of 8.8 per cent from the last general election . part of the outcome
was caused by purely local issues (example : recent government
proposals to lower protective tariffs on jute, which would jeopardize
an industry that employs 20 per cent of the city's work force), and the
loss was not as sharp as the tories' recent defeat at thriving,
middle-class luton . but the tories were painfully aware that they have
little time to reverse labor's gains before elections, probably next
spring . . . . (tridots) one of the most popular tory leaders,
elfin-faced, effervescent viscount hailsham, last week followed the

turkey just any government at all turkey seems to be in the grip
of a perpetual crisis . after the army toppled the corrupt,
free-spending regime of premier adnan menderes in 1960 and executed
him, the military ruled ineffectually for 18 months, then let civilians
take over . durable ismet inonu became premier, decided to try to hold
the country together amidst the lingering bitterness without curbing
parliamentary democracy . probably no one else could have done it .
inonu, 80, seemed like an embodiment of turkey's past : born under the
sultanate, he was one of kemal ataturk's most dashing revolutionary
generals, first became prime minister in 1923, served on and off as
premier or president of turkey for 40 years . yet last week inonu was
again fighting to save turkey from new political turmoil . new dilemma
. inonu and his people's republican party inaugurated overdue reforms,
but these did not necessarily make him popular . bureaucrats were
angered by his campaign against waste . businessmen and big landowners
were incensed by new schemes to make them pay taxes . plain consumers
were mad at the attempt to put government monopolies on a profitmaking
basis, which raised prices . peasants, who still would rather have new
mosques than new schools, hankered for the old days when menderes built
8,000 village shrines . menderes' heirs in the justice party kept
gaining ground with their strange mixture of aging leaders forever
trotting out the ghost of the dead leader and young politicians forever
promising that they could run things more efficiently than inonu . in
last month's nationwide municipal elections, inonu was plainly
overconfident . while justice party leader ragip gumuspala, 66,
campaigned strenuously, covering thousands of miles a week, inonu
loftily limited his politicking to a single 20-minute radio speech .
the results gave inonu's republicans only 37 per cent of the vote ;
two smaller parties in inonu's shaky government coalition were
virtually wiped out . the winner was the justice party, with 46 per
cent of the ballots . last week inonu resigned . his dilemma : neither
major party can rule separately, since each lacks a parliamentary
majority, and neither wants to rule jointly, since that experiment was
tried once before, lasted seven months and accomplished nothing . none
of the smaller parties seem eager to join another coalition, either .
new national elections ? nobody is enthusiastic over that idea . try
again . for the time being, at least, the army was sticking to its
pledge of political neutrality, but no one could be sure how long the
military would resist the idea of restoring " stability " by staging
another takeover . by week's end turkey's president, general cemal
gursel, came to inonu and asked him to form a new cabinet ;
conceivably, he might succeed, by persuading one of the small parties
to join a coalition and picking up enough defectors elsewhere to scrape
up a parliamentary majority . after all, inonu's immediate aim was not
a stable government, but any government at all .

anxious to make the list more exclusive . de gaulle has recently

dwindled to 125,000 in ten years . everyone bites . the order was

their virtue, their talent " upheld the glory of the republic, in which

italy's new partnership
/ this is oil and water, " cracked italy's new
foreign minister giuseppe saragat . the new center-left coalition,
outgrowth of the apertura a sinistra (opening to the left) which
started almost two years ago, last week finally managed to form a
cabinet . in addition to the premiership, the christian democrats wound
up with 15 of the 26 cabinet positions, including the key ministries of
defense, treasury, and internal affairs . along with the vice
premiership, the left-wing socialists got five more posts, the only
important one being the budget ministry . four cabinet jobs went to the
solidly anti-communist social democrats (including saragat's foreign
ministry) and the moderate republicans . italy's 25th cabinet in 20
years joins parties of different aims into an alliance based on what
each side hopefully takes to be expediency : the christian democrats
want socialist support for a far-ranging package of reforms ; the
socialists want to exercise power after 16 years in political exile .
as oddly matched as the parties themselves are their two leaders, for
the foreseeable future the key political figures in italy .
premier aldo moro, 47, is
the antithesis of the voluble, emotional italian . a reserved onetime
law professor, he detests the acid name calling of italian politics, is
so shy that he often travels by car to avoid the necessary social
amenities on planes and trains . moro's political genius is for
compromise, sometimes achieved by pure tenacity . he once reduced a
colleague to near collapse by arguing reasonably for four uninterrupted
hours . so conscientiously capable is moro of seeing all sides of every
question that friends and foes alike are convinced that he agrees only
with them . moro's colorless caution was the very quality that boosted
him to political prominence . five years ago, after sharp-tongued
amintore fanfani quit in a huff as christian democratic leader in a
dispute over his then still heavily opposed plans for an opening to the
left party elders looked for a replacement . he had to be a man nobody
was mad at, and moro filled the bill . although fanfani later became
premier for more than two years, moro stayed on as the party's chief
strategist . no less vigorous than fanfani in his advocacy of the
center-left alliance, moro at the same time was more militantly
anti-communist than fanfani and therefore proved far more persuasive
when it came to selling conservative christian democrats on the scheme
. prophetically, moro had once tried to join the socialist party but
was turned down as being " too catholic . " a devout churchgoer who
attends mass daily, he was born in lecce in the heel of italy's boot,
studied law at the university of bari, at 24 began teaching . entering
parliament in 1946, the newcomer was nicknamed by his colleagues " the
quaker " because of his dour outlook and austere habits . through sheer
diligence, moro became under secretary for foreign affairs in 1948,
received his own ministry (justice) in 1955 . however, his speeches as
a politician sounded as if he were still addressing law students at
bari, contained so many pedantic abstractions that deciphering his
meanings gave rise to a whole new group of experts known as "
morologists . /
married, father of
four daughters and one son, moro lives unpretentiously in a
lower-middle-class apartment district in rome . his wife, who almost
never appears in public with him, owns few fancy furs or jewels .
outside of his family, moro's only nonpolitical passion is flowers,
which he raises at a small country house about 30 miles froom rome . "
there, " he says, " i am perfectly at ease because i am with my
children and my roses . " vice premier pietro nenni, 72, is as
impulsive as moro is deliberate . while moro achieves agreement through
patience, nenni often gets his way by sheer charm and eloquence . in
more than half a century, his career has followed innumerable twists
and turns . even as a youth in romagna, in italy's rugged north, nenni
was an adept at political expediency . after his peasant parents died,
he was placed in an orphanage by an aristocratic family . every sunday
nenni recited his catechism before the countess and if he did well
received a silver coin . " generous but humiliating, " he recalled . he
became a socialist and befriended a fellow romagnan named benito
mussolini . il duce's fascist thugs later almost shot nenni when they
raided and burned his socialist headquarters in milan . nenni fled to
france, and during the next 17 years fought on the loyalist side in
spain, was captured by the nazis in occupied france during world war
ii, turned over to italian police, and deported to the lonely island of
ponza in the tyrrhenian sea in 1943 . three days after nenni arrived,
the shortlived government of marshal badoglio shipped another exile to
ponza : mussolini . nenni made his way to rome, became foreign
minister and vice premier in a coalition cabinet that included
communists . with a beret pushed to the back of his head and his bull
voice roaring, nenni demanded " unity of the working class, "
faithfully backed moscow . stalin rewarded him with a peace prize in
1951 . slowly nenni realized that the socialists were captives of the
italian communists . yet he could not escape without shattering his
party, which was heavily infiltrated by reds . finally, moscow's brutal
crushing of the hungarian rebellion and khrushchev's destalinization
speech in 1956 gave nenni the chance he was looking for : he broke his
/ action pact " with the communists, although the party still preserved
close ties with them . nenni also returned the stalin prize money
($25,000), which he had used to buy a luxurious seaside villa . in
rome, nenni lives more modestly in an apartment with his wife and one
of his three daughters, giuliana, a socialist senator . in frail health
he fell in a mountain stream 17 months ago and injured his head nenni
needed all his powers to persuade his sharply divided party to enter
the center-left coalition . at least for the time being, nenni has
lived down the boast he uttered 16 years ago : " not even a revolver
pressed against my head will make me break with the communists . /

president ngo dinh diem was that he kept some of his best officers in
noncombat jobs for political reasons . one promise made by diem's
successors was to appoint aggressive new commanders and give them a
free hand . last week the first such new commander found himself sacked
and ordered to a desk exile that even diem had not thought of military
attache in formosa . five days after the coup, colonel pham van dong,
44, was placed in command of the 7th division, responsible for two
provinces south of saigon . in his first twelve days on the job, dong
launched seven major operations, but then the viet cong regained the
initiative . when one village near the capital was severely shelled and
several people were killed, the villagers complained bitterly . even
though such attacks are standard, the generals in saigon fired dong, to
the disappointment of u.s . advisers . but why transfer him 1,400 miles
away ? according to one version, dong had been too friendly with the
ruling junta's ambitious no . 3 man, major general ton that dinh, whom
some of his colleagues consider potentially troublesome . room at the
top . as the revolutionary glow that followed diem's overthrow fades,
south viet nam's generals seem to be watching each other ever more
alertly . they now often wrangle over policy in marathon debates that
last until 5 a.m . bureaucracy also takes its toll of leadership .
brigadier general le van kim, a top strategist, is occupied by
administrative chores ; last week one of his staff's chief projects
was requisitioning three typewriters . near by, general dinh flopped
back in his chair, groused that the pile of paper on his desk grows
higher each day . u.s . officials maintain that the generals are
quietly accomplishing much beneath the surface ; considered an
important achievement is the junta's start at winning over the hoa hao
and cao dai sects, many of whose members had collaborated with the viet
cong . but the junta chairman, lieut . general duong van ( " big " )
minh, seems reluctant to wield power, and the outsized, 22-member
military revolutionary council has taken few outwardly bold steps .
reported time correspondent murray gart : " none of this proves that
the generals cannot do the job of running south viet nam . it is too
soon to tell . but for the moment, there is a power vacuum at the top
in a country at war . " in saigon, there were new suicides by fire, the
first since the coup and virtually ignored in comparison to the
relentlessly publicized buddhist suicides under diem . a 17-year-old
girl, bach tri nga, drenched herself with gasoline and touched a match
to her skirts before the local residences of the international control
commission, set up in 1954 to oversee viet nam's partition . a
22year-old unemployed pedicab driver cremated himself half a block from
the u.s . ambassador's residence, and a young telephone operator
followed suit (he left a note saying he had been rejected by his
father) . the charred skeleton of a third victim, an older man, was
found near a suburban graveyard . authorities insisted that the men
acted out of personal despondency but conceded that the girl may have
had pro-communist propaganda in mind a farewell note repeated the
neutralist line against " vietnamese fighting vietnamese . " all the
way home . the fighting itself continued intensely and inconclusively .
sixty miles northwest of the capital, the viet cong poured a terrifying
150 rounds of mortar and recoilless rifle fire into the lonely outpost
of bauco, then overran two of its three blockhouses . of the 60
defenders, 18 died, 21 were wounded and 21 captured . also found
sprawled dead within the post : 16 women and children . the government
chased the attackers in an operation involving 3,000 men, but the
guerrillas vanished . five more americans apparently lost their lives a
sergeant shot in an ambush and four airmen aboard an rb-26 that crashed
into the mekong river . the u.s., nevertheless, went ahead with plans
to bring home 1,000 troops from viet nam by new year's chiefly
noncombat technicians, many of whose duties are being assumed by
vietnamese . at saigon airport last week, the initial 294 u.s.-bound
servicemen, many happily bearing lipstick smears from saigon sweeties,
clambered aboard four c-135 jets . present to see the first men off
were u.s . general paul d . harkins and south viet nam's defense

sikkim from debutante to the deities as a debutante and a
sarah lawrence graduate (in oriental studies), hope cooke had a crush on
central asia . her dreams seemed to come romantically true last march
when she married sikkim's crown prince palden thondup namgyal in a
now-legendary ceremony at the capital city of gangtok (time, march 23)
. last week, when the crown prince's 70-year-old father, maharajah sir
tashi namgyal, died of cancer in a calcutta nursing home, hope and her
husband mounted the throne of the mountain-locked himalayan kingdom .
the formal coronation will take place after one year's mourning, the
precise date to be calculated by the court astrologers . private
mountain . the land where hope will rule is so small that its 2,748 sq
. mi . and 162,000 people could fit comfortably into a u.s . national
park like yellowstone . the new maharajah personally owns kanchenjunga
which, at 28,146 ft., is the third tallest mountain in the world and
probably the world's most majestic when its snowy peaks are lit by the
sunrise and borne aloft on lacy clouds . sikkim contains every variety
of climate and plant, from the subtropical through the temperate to the
arctic . snow leopards prowl the himalayan slopes, pandas frolic in the
forested gorges, clouds of butterflies hover over 3,000 different kinds
of rhododendron and 400 types of orchid . wedged between tibet and
india, sikkim usually has been tributary to one or another of its
neighbors . when india won its independence from britain in 1947, so
did sikkim . but to the late maharajah, freedom brought more problems
than profit . one day in 1949, several thousand peasants swarmed around
the blue and white royal palace (actually a large bungalow) demanding
an elected national council and tax reforms . tashi submitted to the
experiment in democracy for 29 days and then, feeling unable to cope
with what was called " threatened disorder, " asked india's nehru for
help . nehru sent in troops and a dewan, or political officer . ever
since, india has handled sikkim's foreign affairs and defense .
,alarmed nude . in recent years, tashi retired into a private life that
consisted largely of prayer and painting he specialized in misty
sikkimese landscapes, and painted one " vision " of the abominable
snowman, who is pictured as a skinny, jet-black animal with a red face
scampering over a snowy summit carrying a nude, pink-skinned lady with
an alarmed expression . tashi conversed with spirits, who are
prevalent in sikkim, looked out at the world through green-tinted
glasses, and seemed fashioned of gold, so stiff and heavy were his
brocaded robes . the maharajah was educated in india, is fluent in five
languages including english, and is said to be a reincarnation of his
uncle, who was a revered lama . " aren't we all reincarnations of a
sort ? ' ? he asks politely, evidently is more interested in
agriculture and atomic energy than in the miraculous . he hopes that
sikkim can earn dollars abroad by adding copper to its current exports
of cardamom seeds, oranges, and imitation scotch whisky made by a
parsi distiller from bombay . when he was proclaimed maharajah last
week, palden thondup outlined a program worthy of socialist
scandinavia, declaring that " jointly and steadfastly we shall reach
our goal of freedom from want, disease and illiteracy, and usher in a
welfare state so that sikkim can enjoy her rightful place under the sun
. " the new maharani hope, who is called lhachem kusho (consort of the
deities) by her subjects, intends eventually to write a history of
sikkim . in preparation, she is learning two of the nation's most
important languages, bhutia and nepali . the project is dexlayed by her
duties to the royal household of 20 servants and three aides-de-camp she
will undoubtedly be further delayed by the fact that she expects a baby
this spring one event whose timing will not be controlled by sikkim's

a nation of 22 million people plagued by at least five separate
rebellions, ranging from the kachin tribesmen, who want autonomy, to
the red flag communists, who are so fanatical that they think even
china's mao tse-tung is " too moderate . " burmese businessmen bitterly
resent the nationalization of industry ; peasants grumble at the
collectivization of agriculture ; buddhist monks protest that
government expropriation of the rich robs them of endowments . ne win's
latest enemies are the students who, spurred on by the communists, last
week staged demonstrations and riots all over the country . safe
conduct . during the past four months, ne win has desperately tried to
make peace with burma's assorted rebels . he guaranteed safe conduct
for political and tribal leaders from and to their swamp and jungle
hideouts . results were discouraging . ne win complained that the
rebels particularly the communists only wanted to buy time in which to
regroup, rearm and prepare new offensives . he broke off the talks, let
the leaders return to their jungle camps and then began a police
roundup of 1,400 leftists of all shades . to prove he had civilian
support somewhere, ne win had army trucks pick up some 20,000 workers
for a " spontaneous " rally in rangoon . at that point the students
went into action, led an assault on the rally, throwing stones, ripping
up placards and setting one army truck afire to shouts of, " we don't
want this government ! " when ne win ordered the closing down of
rangoon university last week, the students, led by leftist agitators,
barricaded the gates and staged a sit-in . bulldozers ordered out to
smash the barricades were beaten back with hurled stones, and fire
hoses failed because of insufficient water pressure . finally, tough
riot police with tear gas dislodged the students . three other
universities at bassein, moulmein and mandalay were padlocked by the
government . shaven head . ne win's only visible support remains the
50,000-man burmese army, but there is evidence that even this last
bulwark is being undermined ; popular brigadier aung gyi, who
disagrees with ne win's policies, is in exile in a buddhist monastery
where, his head shaven, he spends his time meditating . at week's end
the student turmoil continued, and insurgents stepped up their attacks
on police outposts and army convoys . in heavily guarded government
house, ne win was still hard at work pushing his headlong, headstrong
course toward socialism . last week he nationalized 17 more private
organizations, including the automobile association of burma and a
tailors association . after all, there's not much left to nationalize

guinea trouble in erewhon " an african statesman, " allows
guinea's president sekou toure, " is not a naked boy begging from rich
capitalists . " on the contrary, many of his country's well-dressed
officials own sumptuous villas and cars, favor french food, american
cigarettes and scotch whisky (at $18 a bottle) . conakry, guinea's
sweltering capital, has plans for two new luxury hotels one to be built
by the u.s., the other by the russians . but guinea (pop . 3,300,000),
once one of french west africa's richest countries, after five years of
independence has become one of the poorest . this week, a mission
headed by economic development minister ismael toure, sekou's
half-brother, is due in washington, expected to plead with the
administration to double the $15 million in aid that the u.s . has
funneled into guinea this year . sears, with credit . despite
diversified agriculture and abundant natural resources (notably,
bauxite, iron, diamonds), strongman toure's blend of xenophobia and
socialism saddled the country with severe food shortages, inflation and
gaping trade deficits . the trouble, as one western visitor puts it, is
that guinea's government has long viewed foreign aid as " one big
sears, roebuck store, with unlimited credit . " alone among france's
black african territories, guinea chose total independence rather than
charles de gaulle's offer of continued " association . " when french
aid was cut off, toure turned instinctively to the soviet bloc, whose
economic embrace rapidly made guinea a kind of cold-war erewhon . in
return for its prized pineapples, bananas and other produce, moscow
sent tropical guinea overpriced, superannuated snowplows, prefabricated
housing units that its workmen cannot assemble, and a plant to produce
shaved ice, which melts instantly in conakry's savage heat . as
elsewhere, the communists concentrated on showy prestige projects, such
as a sports stadium (still unfinished after three years), a vast brick
factory, a printing plant capable of producing 40,000 newspapers an
hour, though at most one in ten guineans can read . experts discovered
that a russian-built radio station, designed to beam the voice of toure
the length of africa, had been sited on an iron lode that badly
interferes with transmission . miffed mammies . toure learned to fear
russians bearing gifts . soviet loans petered out soon after he
expelled the russian ambassador for fomenting anti-toure demonstrations
in 1961 in one of his more astute aidmanship gambits, he later snubbed
moscow by strengthening his ties with peking, whose technicians have
already built a match factory and a cigarette plant . but
russian/dictated " reforms " and toure's own policies persisted . on
moscow's urging, toure had divorced guinea's currency from france's
monetary system, flooded the country with new paper francs embellished
with his portrait, which were almost valueless outside guinea . as a
result, cattle, coffee and bananas and u.s . food for peace supplies
were smuggled into neighboring countries to be sold for hard currenny .
toure also nationalized virtually every business in guinea, including
the once-lucrative diamond mines . soon every commodity from tap water
to beer-bottle caps was in short supply . once-docile guineans reacted
by staging an angry series of food riots this year . though toure
prides himself on his emancipation of womenfolk he has also insisted
that traditionally bare-breasted banana porters cover up it was
guinea's vociferous market mammies miffed at perennial shortages and
soaring
prices, who finally forced the president to make his first drastic
economic reforms by threatening to march on conakry . fearful that he
might be overthrown, toure last october hastily dismantled dozens of
state monopolies and allowed private retailers to buy up their stocks .
in repeated broadcasts, he confessed that his nationalization of the
economy had been a colossal flop . said he : " the private trader has
a greater sense of responsibility than civil servants, who get paid at
the end of each month and only once in a while think of the nation or
their own responsibility . " but western businessmen are wondering
whether toure's apparent conversion to free enterprise is sincere and
whether it comes too late to do much good .

russia something for the soil in the kremlin this week, the
soviet communist party's central committee is pondering the grave
crisis in agriculture that has made it virtually impossible for russia
to feed itself . up for debate is nikita khrushchev's sweeping plan for
expansion of the chemical industry to raise fertilizer production from
20 million tons this year to 108 million tons by 1970 . fertilizer has
become a kind of ritual incantation ; nikita is obviously convinced
that only its vastly increased use can raise production enough to avoid
drastic food cuts or permanent dependence on expensive foreign farm
products, such as the 11 million tons of wheat the soviets are buying
from the west . asks a current moscow joke : " what was stalin's last
mistake ? " answer : " he stockpiled enough grain for only ten years
. " major new investments in the chemical industry are sure to force a
cutback in consumer production, housing, possibly defense ; but the
situation on russian farms warrants it . yields this year have been
poor in the ukraine and siberia . last week the administrator for the
virgin lands, khrushchev's pet farm project, openly admitted disaster
in his regions as well, citing staggering examples of mismanagement and
inefficiency . another obvious topic for the moscow party meeting is
the split with red china . even as the russian press was pleading for
calm, peking's delegates to the communist world peace council in warsaw
noisily condemned russia's " peaceful coexistence " policy, including
the nuclear test ban . russian delegates retorted, as new china news

nato nagging in moments of grave crisis, nato is a model of
arm-in-arm harmony . but when there are no berlin blockades or cuban
missiles to bring out their underlying unity, the western allies are
divided . there is little doubt anywhere that the u.s . has crushing
nuclear superiority over the russians . disagreement arises over the
questions of 1) how much of a voice europe is to have as to when and
how this u.s . force is to be applied, and 2) what western strategy
should be in the intermediate grey area short of total war, an area in
which nato is perhaps more important politically than militarily .
these problems swirled up again this week as the foreign and defense
ministers of 15 nato nations sat down for their big annual review
conference in paris . massive or flexible . for the record, the agenda
was crowded with distant general matters : what next in disarmament
talks with russia ? what meaning for the west in the sino-soviet
split ? but in a kind of corridor warfare and in separate bilateral
meetings, some factions tried to maneuver the u.s . into giving europe
more say in the use of the h-bomb, and others looked for ways to
frustrate charles de gaulle's force de dissuasion . under u.s . urging,
secretary-general dirk stikker (ailing and probably due for early
retirement) is carrying out sweeping studies to reassess nato force
levels and basic strategy . the french have been working against the "
stikker studies . " clinging to their own massive retaliation theory,
which holds that any aggression in europe must turn into a nuclear war,
de gaulle's men sneer at
washington's concept of " balanced " conventional-and-nuclear forces to
provide a " flexible response " to red moves . force or farce . paris
is equally skeptical of washington's proposed multilateral force ( "
multilateral farce, " the french call it) . so are most of the other
allies . but at least a few are beginning to believe that the idea
surface ships armed with polaris weapons and manned by mixed crews from
various nato nations just might work. no one has any other practical
or even impractical plan to give europe a greater share in the use of
the bomb . from the rational french viewpoint, the sense of " sharing "
provided by mlf would be an illusion, since the u.s . would still
retain control of the missiles themselves . but lyndon johnson has
hinted that this control might be transferred to the europeans if and
when europe truly unites . there were other nato problems and squabbles
: the command structure is badly outdated, and the western big three
are too heavily represented on nato staffs at the expense of other
allies . one concrete accomplishment : agreement to set up a $308
million electronic system stretching from norway to turkey that will
provide quick identification and control for such fastmoving new
aircraft as the f-104 . its less than martial name : nadge (nato air
defense ground environment) .

charles, " i remonstrated feebly, " what are you doing ? " he looked
at me hungrily . " just point out your bedroom, " he said . " you have
nothing to fear, cherie . " as a lover, charles brousse was the most
ardent of all those i met in my career as a spy . . . despite the
bottled-in-bond flavor, the scene actually took place in wartime
washington . it was recounted recently in london's the people by its
heroine, a mata hari from minnesota who worked for british intelligence
under the code name cynthia . her real name : elizabeth pack . using
the boudoir as ian fleming's hero uses a beretta, she was described by
her wartime boss as " the greatest unsung heroine of the war . " after
the war cynthia married her onetime prey, the ardent charles, and with
him retreated to a remote 10th century french chateau where she died
last week, at 53, of throat cancer . scuppered admiral . when world war
ii broke out, blonde, green-eyed cynthia had been married for nine
years to arthur pack, a colorless british diplomat who was nearly twice
her age . the daughter of a u.s . marine corps colonel, at 29 she was
adventurous, astute, attractive and, from diligent years on europe's
diplomatic circuit, already an old hand at affairs of state . leaving
her husband, she returned to the u.s . shortly after the fall of
france, immediately joined british security coordination (b.s.c.), the
manhattanbased intelligence and counterespionage network that was run
by sir william stephenson, the famed " quiet canadian . " he sent
cynthia to washington, where she took a georgetown house on o street
and went to work . cynthia's first big assignment was enough to daunt
the wiliest old pro : her orders were to get hold of the italian naval
code book . within a few weeks of first meeting the shapely betty pack,
italy's naval attache, admiral alberto lais, was so scuppered by her
that he surrendered the code with hardly a murmur . italian apologists
maintain that lais, who died in 1951, was actually so ungallant as to
give his mistress a fake cipher book . undeniably, however, british
intelligence thereafter proved uncannily adept at forestalling italian
fleet movements, notably in the march 1941 sea battle off greece's cape
matapan, where the royal navy crippled italy's numerically superior
force . outwitted watchman . for the u.s . as well as britain,
cynthia's most valuable coup was to capture the secret code used by the
vichy government's diplomatic missions as well as the french fleet,
which might otherwise have taken thousands of allied lives during the
invasion of north africa . posing as a washington newshen, cynthia had
already seduced the dashing captain brousse, then the press attache in
the petain government's washington embassy ; by playing on his hatred
of the nazis, she made him a willing ally . " i was not just indulging
his desires so as to get him to disclose military and diplomatic
intelligence, " wrote cynthia . " i was fulfilling a deep need of my
own . " brousse more than satisfied her bosses' needs as well by
supplying daily copies of all french diplomatic cables . in 1942, when
the embassy's naval attache proved seducible but obdurately pro-vichy,
brousse even agreed to help her filch the code books from the attache's
office so that they could be copied and returned to the embassy safe
unnoticed . their tactics were exquisitely gallic . charles showed up
at the embassy with cynthia one night and, rustling a few dollar bills,
whispered to the understanding watchman that mme . brousse was
suspicious of their liaison (she was, indeed, and later divorced him) .
the embassy, brousse explained to the guard, was the only place where
he and his girl could rendezvous, and they soon became regular visitors
. on the night they planned to lift the code, with the help of a
safebreaker called the georgia cracker, they put the watchman to sleep
with drugged champagne, only to find that the locks were so tough that
they had to complete the job a few nights later . by now, they guessed
that the night watchman must suspect that it was not just amour they
were after . sure enough, soon after cynthia and her lover entered the
darkened office, the door burst open and the watchman studied them
under a powerful flashlight . finally, he blurted, " i beg your pardon,
madame, a thousand times, " and fled down the corridor . before going
to work on the safe, cynthia had taken the simple precaution of
removing all her clothes .

russia better things for better living through chemistry ? /
utopians think that science can transform the atlantic ocean into
lemonade, " snorted karl marx's co-worker, friedrich engels . yet who
should be serving up lemonade last week than that old realist nikita
khrushchev . in the kremlin's marble-halled palace of the congresses,
addressing the communist party central committee and more than 5,000
other comrades, nikita promised that one great force would miraculously
straighten out the soviet economic mess : big chemistry . between 1964
and 1970, khrushchev announced, the regime will spend $46 billion to
expand the soviet chemical industry about the same amount that now goes
annually into all domestic economic development . where would the
additional money come from ? khrushchev hinted at a radical reduction
in military spending . more important, he admitted that russia would
need credit and supplies, including entire factories, from the west but
not, he fumed, at " fabulous profits " to the capitalists . brave talk
. plans call for building 200 new plants and modernizing 500 old ones
; since much of the new production will be plastics and synthetic
fibers, soviet citizens may at last find it easier to buy such simple
items as nylon stockings and linoleum flooring . " for the first time
in all the 46 years of soviet power, " said nikita in a remarkable
confession, the party and the state can do something about " satisfying
the requirements of the people . " moreover, new products must show
better design, because it is " no longer possible to tolerate " russian
consumer goods that " look less smart than foreign articles . " an even
more urgent task for big chemistry is the production of chemical
fertilizer . its output, promised khrushchev, would be quadrupled from
20 million tons this year to 80 million tons by 1970 . this would
permit russia to catch up with the u.s., for u.s . farm surpluses are
not the result of any " special american wisdom, " khrushchev insisted
; it is just that the u.s . uses almost twice as much fertilizer as
the soviet union on about half the acreage . through all this brave
talk ran the admission of russia's disastrous agricultural failures .
one arresting figure : although acreage increased 7 per cent since
last year, yield actually dropped 20 per cent . if anyone was inclined
to criticize this failure, or the costly palliative of buying grain
from the west, khrushchev had the standard answer . remember how
bad things
were under stalin . in 1947, to earn foreign exchange, stalin and
molotov actually sold grain abroad while in a number of areas " people
had bloated stomachs or even died from lack of food . " it was the
first time moscow had admitted that starvation took place in the soviet
union since the forced collectivization of the early 1930s . bulging
warehouses . following khrushchev's 4f-hour speech, other communist
bigwigs shook the audience with a series of angry complaints . most
collective farmers do not know the first thing about using chemical
fertilizer ; the ukraine is planning a crash program to educate 4,000
/ skilled fertilizer appliers . " superphosphate fertilizer arrives at
the farms with only 20 per cent of the required chemical nutrients ;
the rest is worthless ballast that gets lumpy and heavy in the rain .
russia has an impressive 561 soil laboratories, but most of them have
only one or two employees and the wrong equipment . as for the chemical
industry itself, managers are still waiting for delivery of equipment
designed ten years ago . some of the products are so ungainly that they
pile up unsold in warehouses for instance, synthetic fur coats, which,
complained one speaker, " are so heavy that only well-trained athletes
can wear them . " only about 30 per cent of the workers in the industry
are engaged in production, while the rest are occupied with maintenance
or bureaucratic tasks . moreover, workers are underpaid and receive
only a fraction of the prescribed incentive bonuses . the matter of
personal incentives was clearly the key to the situation, both in
industry and agriculture . it is the very nature of collective farming
not the relatively superficial problem of fertilizer production that
accounts for the chronic crisis . as khrushchev's own figures showed,
peasants working on their tiny, private half-acre plots, which comprise
less than 1 per cent of the arable land, sell to the state 14 per cent
of the country's meat, 30 per cent of the eggs, and raise 65 per cent
of the cabbages and potatoes .

thailand death of a man on a visit to thailand two years ago,
lyndon johnson said that the time had come for south east asia to /
separate the men from the boys " in its battle against communist
aggression . in every sense of the word, thailand's premier sarit
thanarat was a man . a bluff, hard-wenching, hard-drinking soldier,
sarit was also a masterly pro-western politician who stabilized
thailand's chaotic government and sagging economy, rooted out official
corruption and cracked down hard on communist infiltration . in the "
domino " view of southeast asia, according to which the collapse of one
country could knock over all the others, thailand alone stood firm,
surrounded by tottering neighbors laos, cambodia, viet nam, burma .
when sarit died last week at 55, the u.s . for the first time in five
years was forced to worry whether thailand would become another of
southeast asia's wavering dominoes . trick achieved . though marshal
sarit ruled thailand as an absolute dictator, he had a strong sense of
responsibility toward country and people . " anybody can stage a
revolution, " he said after seizing power in a bloodless coup in 1957 .
/ the trick, once the revolution has been staged, is winning public
approval . " on doctor's orders, he went on the wagon, began
housecleaning thailand from top to bottom . he banned opium smoking,
and when a rash of fires broke out in bangkok's business district one
winter, he ordered four chinese merchants shot a brutal but effective
reminder that the annual custom of burning shops to collect insurance
for the chinese new year was now taboo . sarit slashed the price of
rice, transportation and school fees, allocated as much money for
education as for defense . he encouraged foreign investment and
industrial expansion, had more than $500 million in foreign exchange
reserves socked away, spurred a healthy 6 per cent annual rise in the
g.n.p . when communist guerrillas stepped up their campaign of
subversion in the scrubby, impoverished northeast provinces, sarit set
in motion a crash $300 million program of medical, economic and
educational development that undercut the red threat . though his rule
was absolute, he always knelt before thailand's king bhumibol
adulyadej, encouraged thais to accept the king as head of state and
symbol of national unity . three weeks ago, sarit went to the hospital
with complications arising from cirrhosis of the liver and a lifetime
of hard living . among his other ailments : enlargement of the heart,
high blood pressure, kidney disease, congested lungs . from his
hospital bed, he sang to his wife an old thai ballad that begins : /
the love of 100 mistresses could not be compared to the love one has
for his own wife.' ? the u.s . army surgeon general rushed to bangkok
to treat sarit, but his heart finally gave out . the job ahead .
sarit's death occasioned national mourning and honors usually accorded
only to thailand's royal family . dressed in a field marshal's uniform,
sarit's body was placed on a bier in bangkok on the grounds of the
marble temple . thousands of mourners poured scented water from conch
shells over the corpse's extended right hand as a gesture of farewell
and as a plea for forgiveness for any grievance committed against the
dead man . then the body, folded in a fetal position, was put in an
ornate golden urn, where it will remain until it is cremated, probably
some time in the early spring . sarit's successor is former vice
premier and defense minister thanom kittikachorn, 52, a handsome,
amiable army general who served unimpressively as premier in 1958 when
sarit was laid up in a washington hospital . thanom was a close friend
of sarit's and a loyal supporter of his policies ; he immediately
appointed a new cabinet essentially the same as his predecessor's,
promised to follow sarit's pro-western, anti-communist policies . most
in his favor : he inherits a functioning government in which the army
provides power, the topflight civil service contributes administrative
ability, and the monarchy lends legitimacy to the whole . but
remembering thailand's shaky, pre-sarit past, in which coup followed
coup, thailand's most sophisticated leaders know that this system will
have to withstand a strong drift back to the old pattern . the thai
nation faces " a tremendous task, " says able foreign minister thanat
khoman . " it is, as you say in america, a hell of a job . /

special concerts were scheduled to celebrate the occasion . prince
sihanouk allowed civil servants to report for work two hours later for

its ambassador from washington . at the same time, with consummate gall
a government announcement claimed that the u.s . had taken " too

south viet nam back to
saigon this week, for the second time in three months, goes u.s .
defense secretary robert s . mcnamara . his aim : to size up south
viet nam's new regime, which was helped to power by the u.s . on the
theory that it would fight the war more effectively than the murdered
president diem, but which, so far at least, has provided disappointing
leedership . the war is still showing alarming drift, and the communist
guerrillas have shown signs of getting bolder . last week time
correspondent murray gart, to get his own look at the war, flew on 26
helicopter missions in five days (three of his choppers were hit by
gunfire), came away with the story of a plan for stepped-up aerial
strikes against the reds and some grim impressions of the fighting in
general . gart's report : at saigon
airport before dawn, a swarm of helicopters sputtered to life, their
whirling blades churning up misty contrails in the cool, damp air .
soon a formation of 13 " hueys " (uh-1bs) was airborne and droning away
at 2,000 ft . below, the light of day broke over the mekong delta,
turning rivers and canals into silvery ribbons among the green
paddyfields . inside the choppers, men long hardened to possible death
carefully crushed out their after-breakfast cigarettes . a mere fifteen
minutes out of saigon and directly south of the capital, the three lead
hueys, bristling with rockets and machine guns, buzzed the target area
; they hedge-hopped lines of foliage, hovered over huts, scrutinized
the paddy fields . " negative contact, " u.s . pilot captain dennis
boyle radioed to the main force, meaning no ground fire . the rest of
the fleet fluttered into the zone, and while armed craft circled
protectively, five " skinned " (unarmed) hueys alighted in a clearing
and disgorged 70 vietnamese troops . the soldiers swept through a
village, rounding up peasants suspected of being guerrillas ; some of
the men had been found crouching together, unable to explain why they
were not out in the fields working . one offered a soldier 1,000
piasters ($13.60) to set him free ; the soldier gladly accepted the
payoff, then tagged the captive with a white scarf identifying him as a
probable viet cong . shirts were stripped from backs to check for the
guerrilla's telltale marks of pack straps . forty-five minutes later,
the helicopters were headed back to saigon with a haul of 14 prisoners
. replacing terror . the operation, called an " eagle strike,
/ is a tactic by which the new government and its u.s . advisers hope
to add speed and initiative to anti-guerrilla operations . though such
strikes have long been used in viet nam for missions big and small, the
program now being launched aims to carry out smallscale,
search-and-seize missions as never before, especially in the heavily
infiltrated delta . for the first time the u.s . utility tactical
transport company based at saigon airport has been assigned " eagle
strikes " as a permanent duty . a u.s . major describes the operation
as " a reconnaissance force always seeking out the enemy, striking only
when contact is made or intelligence is good enough to make a landing
worthwhile . also, it is carried out by a small force, not one that
requires the movement of dozens of craft and battalions of men . "
brigadier general joseph w . stilwell jr., " vinegar joe's " son, who "
flies " a desk in saigon but who is always slipping out on chopper
missions, puts the tactical challenge in south viet nam in brutally
frank terms . " the problem, " says he, " is to replace viet cong
control of the countryside, which they maintain through murder, rape,
torture and terror, with something else . we don't use terror tactics .
the eagle strike is the best way to go after them, using the element of
complete surprise . but it is only one way, and we need others . "
after completing their crack-of-dawn mission last week the crews of the
13 hueys and the 70 vietnamese soldiers rested while their choppers
were being refueled, then were airborne again, heading for a
village just twelve miles south of saigon . this time one helicopter in
the first wave took a bullet in the fuselage, but the troop carriers
set down anyway . the soldiers found the village flying a viet cong
flag, rounded up 43 prisoners . back at the base (by now it was noon),
the eagles received a report that a viet cong company had been spotted
moving ten miles south of saigon and scrambled once more . over the
they ran into machine-gun fire, but silenced it with a fusillade of
rockets and bullets the vietnamese landed and rounded up whatever reds
had not managed to escape . private yalu . the helicopter
work requires steady nerves . one armed huey escorting a supply chopper
at an outpost on the plain of reeds west of saigon attacked a
machinegun nest that had opened fire . just before one rocket was
dropped, it was apparently struck by a sniper's bullet and blew up,
shattering the plane's plexiglas windows ; the gunner and the crew
chief suffered superficial but bloody face wounds . the dialogue over
the intercom betrayed no panic : " was a rocket blew up, wasn't it ?
/ it was somethin' . " / you o.k., o'shea .q? " / roger . " / anybody
else get hit ? " / you got a fat lip there, boy . " during another
mission, an aerial attack on two companies of viet cong dug into
foxholes hear the difficult-to-patrol cambodian border, some of the
ground fire came from across a river that separates viet nam from "
neutral " cambodia a river that one american adviser bitterly calls "
our own private yalu . " dismal scene . despite the attempt
at improved mobility, south viet nam's generals have yet to stage any
spectacular feats against the viet cong although they have plans on the
drawing boards, and government forces last week captured more weapons
than they lost for the first time in months . everywhere one travels,
and the only safe mode of travel is by helicopter, the countryside is a
dismal sight of actual or threatened viet cong control . in the delta
to the south, and in two or three provinces around saigon, there is no
doubt of who controls the boondocks . of mounting concern is the
communists' increased hold on vital long an province on saigon's
southern flank, where conditions have become precarious . a u.s .
adviser says wryly that there is no need in long an for the
government's plan to abolish some of the overextended outposts . " the
viet cong, " he says, " are doing that for us . " in a guerrilla war,
it is often impossible to tell who is winning . but in viet nam some
things do seem certain : many more lives will be tragically lost, the
war cannot possibly be won by 1965, and a rich jewel of a country
carved out of ancient indochina sees no end in sight to a decade of
red-instigated fighting . about the best that can be expected is to
maintain hope, apply muscle in the right places, make long-range
commitments, and retain a dogged determination to keep fighting . then
maybe, just maybe, events and the tide of battle will merge to keep
this piece of real estate from communist control .

kenya uhuru is not enough the youth rally at nairobi
last week was interrupted by the sudden appearance of four rangy
africans . each was clad in animal skins, armed with sharp-bladed
pangas and wearing his hair in long braids smeared with red mud the
fighting insignia of the mau mau terrorists . the crowd fell silent as
the four approached the dais where sat prime minister jomo kenyatta and
his honored guest, prince philip, husband of britain's queen elizabeth
. with his lumbering, elephant walk, kenyatta descended from the dais,
pushed through his startled security guards, and greeted the mau mau .
/ kenya is free now, " he said . " there is no need to hide or fight .
/ peacefully, the four men surrendered their weapons . the ceremony .
although kenya's vicious mau mau long ago stopped fighting, many were
still hiding out in the green-black forests on the slopes of mount
kenya . all week they drifted back " field marshal " mwariama and 50
assorted " generals . " the foreign representatives arriving along with
the mau mau ranged from red china's foreign minister chen yi to india's
indira gandhi and u.s . interior secretary stewart udall . also from
the u.s., as guests and entertainers, came harry belafonte and miriam
makeba. there were balls, garden parties, receptions, the laying of
cornerstones, and the presentation of gifts . queen elizabeth gave
kenyatta the royal lodge at sagana ; the aga khan turned over to him
his own former residence ; a group of u.s . businessmen donated a
white lincoln continental . the climax came when kenyatta got into his
new car and was driven to uhuru stadium . at five minutes before
midnight, as kenyatta rose to take part in the flag-raising ceremony,
prince philip whispered jokingly to him, " are you sure you wouldn't
like to change your mind now ? " smiling, kenyatta shook his head
and, accompanied by britain's governor malcolm macdonald (who will stay
on as governor-general), walked to the two flagpoles in the center of
the stadium . in order to spare british onlookers all possible anguish,
kenyatta had tactfully ordered that the lights be dimmed during the
moment the union jack was lowered, and then blazed on again as kenya's
flag was raised . the new banner : black for the people, red for the
blood that has been shed, and green for the land, with thin white lines
inserted between the colors . the white, says kenyatta, is to ensure
that the flag represents all kenyans . slowly the banner of africa's
35th new state unfurled to wild cries of " uhuru ! " and the
explosion of fireworks . minutes later, word reached the stadium that a
team of climbers had reached the summit of mount kenya, planted the new
flag and lit flares that illuminated the sacred mountain " like a
fireball . " the problems . despite his estimated 73 years (he claims
not to be sure of his birth date), and frequent signs of fatigue,
kenyatta is still tall and broadshouldered, his eyes huge and piercing
. in his time he has been a farm boy, student, laborer, meter-reader,
respected anthropologist, headmaster, convicted terrorist and, for
decades, the unparalleled idol of millions of africans . the country he
now rules carries most of its old ills into independence . abroad, the
most immediate problem is a violent quarrel with kenya's northeastern
neighbor, somalia, which lays claim to the barren but extensive
northeastern region, inhabited by 200,000 somalis (see map) . to
diminish such quarrels, kenya is earnestly pushing an east african
federation of kenya with tanganyika and uganda, which would create a
nation of 25 million people and might eventually be extended to such
small states as zanzibar, nyasaland, rwanda and burundi .
internationally, kenya will, of course, be neutralist and accept aid
from both east and west .
independence brought about a
reunion of kenyatta's far-flung families . his english third wife, edna
may, and her 20-year-old son peter, a cambridge undergraduate, flew to
nairobi and were met by kenyatta's fourth wife, ngina, an african, and
his daughters margaret, 34, and jane, 14, by his first wife grace, also
an african . his second wife, whose name kenyatta refuses to divulge,
is said to have died about twelve years ago .
kenyatta himself has hardly shown
any communist sympathies, but his home minister, oginga odinga, is a
left-winger who has already set up a state news agency with russian and
czech help . he is perhaps balanced by justice minister tom mboya, who
is at present politically in the shade, but remains strongly
nationalist and generally pro-western . at home, kenyatta must reckon
with a population that is soaring at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent ,
and though the government intends within five years to settle 50,000
african families on a million acres in the " white highlands " bought
from european settlers with $80 million supplied by britain, by that
time an additional 100,000 families will be clamoring for land .
kenya's huge labor surplus must idly await the slow development of
industry, and there is a great lack of trained professionals to replace
the departing whites . for example, kenya has 750 doctors but needs at
least 9,000 . the outlook . painstakingly, kenyatta pleads with his
people to accept harambee, a swahili word meaning " pull together . "
he tells africans that they must concede full partnership to whites and
asians, and tells his own dominant kikuyu tribe that they must work
amiably with other tribes . the opposition kadu party, which elected
only 31 of the 130-member house of representatives, is falling apart as
more and more of its own representatives climb on the kenyatta
bandwagon, lured by government jobs and patronage . as a result, kenya
will probably become a typically african one-party state, but probably
not in so virulent a form as ghana or guinea . no one can ignore the
difficulties ahead the uneasiness of the remaining white settlers, the
fears of the asians who control most of the nation's commerce, the
age-old tribal rivalries that could explode into separatism or tribal
war . but the departing british are greatly impressed by kenyatta's
growing statesmanship . " only we can save ourselves, " he told his
people last week . " nobody else can save us . in the past we have
blamed the englishman when anything went wrong . we said he was sucking
our blood . now the government is ours, and now you will blame kenyatta
. but you should know that kenyatta, by himself, cannot give you
anything . i urge you to work hard so that our uhuru will be meaningful
. from today on, our motto will be " uhuru na kazi (freedom and work) .

zanzibar long way from utopia " uhuru " was also being
shouted to the southeast, 80 miles from kenya's coast on the tiny,
palm-wreathed island of zanzibar . to the accompaniment of a 41-gun
salute, a red, gold and green flag was hoisted in zanzibar town,
replacing the union jack and ending 73 years of british rule in the
clove-scented protectorate of zanzibar and neighboring pemba island .
with a population of only 300,000 on the two islands, zanzibar becomes
africa's smallest independent nation . for more than three centuries,
zanzibar was the jumping-off place for adventurers and explorers and a
sanctuary for slavers, who carried their black cargo from the mainland
beyond the range of avenging tribes . swept by the monsoons, dhows from
the arabian peninsula brought moslem raiders who installed arab sultans
and kept the island's black majority in bondage cultivating the clove
groves (the island still supplies 75 per cent of the world's cloves) .
after the british took over in 1890, troops kept the racial peace, but
today race riots sporadically erupt . though the arabs make up less
than 20 per cent of the population, they control the economy, dominate
the new government through the arab-led nationalist party . the new
nation faces pressing problems . the per capita income is only $56 a
year, and the population is still so primitive that in last summer's
general election both the nationalist party and the opposition
afro-shirazi party hired witch doctors to influence the results . like
kenya's kenyatta and unlike some other african leaders prime minister
sheik mohammed shamte hamadi does not equate uhuru with utopia . " we
appreciate that freedom does not mean a distribution of loot, " he said
at last week's independence ceremonies . " there is no loot to
distribute . /

ghana outrage at law dictator kwame nkrumah outdid himself
last week . he not only flatly refused to free three politicel
prisoners who had been acquitted by ghana's highest court, but he
summarily fired the judge who had presided over their trial . the
defendants, five in all, were charged aith treason after nkrumah was
wounded in the shoulder by a bomb in an attempt on his life in august
1962 . the dictator's tame press had repeatedly condemned them in
advance . but chief justice sir arku korsah, who headed the three-man
court, chose to ignore the hint . at the end of a 51-day trial, he
convicted two of the accused, who will be hanged, but exonerated the
three top officials who were charged with masterminding the conspiracy
. among the three : former information minister tawia adamafio, 51, a
leftwing, london-educated lawyer who had once been nkrumah's closest
crony . the prosecution cited as " evidence " the fact that adamafio
had refused to sit beside the president on the day that he was to be
killed and claimed that later, when nkrumah lay on a hospital operating
table, he had tried to engage him in " wearisome argument " in order,
literally, to talk him to death . along with the other defendants a
former foreign minister and a leader of nkrumah's ruling convention
people's party adamafio was formally " discharged " by the court . but
the trio was immediately bundled back into the cells . interior
minister kwaku boateng cynically explained that the three prisoners'
acquittal " was the sole responsibility of the judiciary, not of the
government, which is therefore not bound to take any cognizance of it .
/ adamafio and his co-defendants will remain in jail under a law that
permits the government to detain any citizen for ten years without
trial " in order to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to
ghana's security . " leaping to nkrumah's defense, the ghanaian times
recalled franklin roosevelt's 1937 attack on the u.s . supreme court,
adding : " we cannot have a wig-and-gown canteta while rome is burning
. the nation cannot be bamboozled by the diabolic insinuations and
aspersions of a confused and antagonistic judiciary . " nkrumah
completed the outrage when, in violation of ghana's constitution, he
sacked sir arku korsah, 69, a widely respected jurist who in 1956
became ghana's first black chief justice . the news astonished even
ghana's close friends abroad . noting that even south africa ? s
high-handed prime minister hendrik verwoerd has never interfered with

communists the yellow man's burden hong kong's two communist
dailies last week breathlessly recounted the exploits of one cheng ho,
a eunuch employed by the third ming emperor, whose fleet of junks
explored the east african coast 80 years before the portuguese got
there in 1498 . both frontpage stories, purporting to prove that china
and africa had a long history of " friendly intercourse, " celebrated
the departure for post-colonial africa of communist china's premier
chou enlai, who is the grandest panjandrum from peking ever to visit
that continent . the tour, lasting six weeks or more, will take chou
and two planeloads of advisers to at least nine " nonaligned " african
countries, with a side trip to albania, red china's eastern european
satellite, and on the way home, a stopover in pakistan . competing with
moscow for friends among underdeveloped nations, chou evidently wants
to establish the yellow man's burden, even if china cannot exactly
afford to pick it up . among afro-asian countries, peking's prestige
has slumped badly as a result of its refusal to sign the nuclear test
ban . in africa alone, 17 of 33 nations voted last october to deny red
china a seat in the u.n., while only ten had diplomatic relations with
peking . during the flight to cairo aboard a chartered klm dc-7, chou
stripped down to long underwear for a sevenhour sleep, wolfed hearty
portions of russian caviar before landing . though egyptian authorities
provided an enthusiastic crowd to greet the chinese premier, the
official welcome was somewhat restrained . president nasser in tunisia
to attend ceremonies marking france's withdrawal from the bizerte naval
base when chou arrived got back to cairo in time to give a lavish
banquet at abdin palace . he presented red china's premier with egypt's
highest decoration the collar of the nile . in return, chou rose to
pledge an association between their two countries as enduring as " the
everflowing nile and yellow rivers . " but nasser scheduled as few
meetings as possible, instead loaded the visitor's schedule with trips
to nasser's pet projects, notably the aswan dam, where 2,000 russian
technicians could hardly escape chou's notice . what with some $1.5
billion in soviet aid and heavy dependence on u.s . wheat to feed
egypt, nasser has had strained relations with peking of late . days
before chou's arrival, his press belatedly chided china for its attack
on india . the welcome might be more satisfactory in countries that
have or need chinese technicians, loans and trade agreements algeria,
guinea, ghana, mali . elsewhere, chou's reception promises to range
from the cool to the curious, roughly the way it was back in cheng ho's

egypt exodus from nubia " we went to the graves of our
ancestors for the last time, " said sheik ahmed mardani . " the women
and children cried and we tried to console them, but we knew our homes
were lost and our lives changed forever . " sheik mardani's lament was
for himself and 100,000 other nubians in egypt who last week were
being evacuated from their ancestral homeland on the nile banks . the
exodus was necessary because the aswan high dam, being built by egypt
with russian help, next spring will back up the nile, creating a huge
1,800-sq.-mi . reservoir that eventually will give egypt vast new
irrigated acres and electric power . but it will also flood the gaily
painted houses of the nubians, their cemeteries, mosques and groves of
date palm . wild valley . in their wild, inaccessible valley, the
nubians prospered tranquilly for centuries until the first aswan low
dam was built in 1902 . the rising nile water drove the villagers
farther up the cliffs, and the process was repeated in 1912 and 1933 as
the dam was successively raised to a height of 182 ft . half of nubia's
30,000 arable acres were lost and the remaining 15,000 could only be
hastily cultivated when the nile was low . as the land vanished, nubian
men sought work in the cities, where their proverbial honesty and
fanatical cleanliness won them jobs . now, at the rate of 300 a day,
the remaining nubians are being moved downstream from their villages to
the kom ombo area, some 40 miles north of aswan . the government of
president gamal abdel nasser, determined to make a showpiece of kom
ombo, is at work on 25,000 houses, 138 stores, 33 mosques and 36
schools . the houses have been built largely to the nubians' own
specifications, with high-walled patios, animal pens, 12-ft . ceilings
and up to four bedrooms per house . they will soon be adorned with
traditional nubian frescoes stylized scorpions, lions, fish, snakes,
suns, moons and stars . " after all, " says sheik mardani, " there's no
law against beauty . " thundering express . yet most nubians were
appalled by the first sight of their new home . groaned one old man :
/ i used to be awakened each morning by the murmuring river waters .
now it is the dawn cairo express from aswan thundering in my ears . "
in nubia, polygamous husbands had separate houses for each wife ; at
kom ombo, a man's wives must share his house, and many husbands,
dismayed by the prospect, have divorced all wives save one . but a man
who risked keeping both his wives concedes that the arrangement has
advantages . " here i do not have to move from house to house . i go
one night to one room, the next night to the other room . it spares the
strength of my wives and is good for me, too . since i have a third
bedroom, i'm thinking of getting a third wife . " nubian women seem
happy about the move . stone walls and concrete floors are a welcome
change after a dusty lifetime of adobe and mud . besides, there are
movies, television, schools and clinics . as the nubians file aboard
the paddle steamer headed for kom ombo loaded down with palm fiber
beds, carved wooden chests, magical amulets, goats and sheep they try
to exorcise their grief of leave-taking by singing . one song runs : "

greece goodbye again " everybody wanted to cut my wings, /
protested ex-premier constantine karamanlis . " i refused to stay and
let them use their scissors . " with this bitter farewell hurled at
king paul, and at greek voters who had ended his eight-year
administration, karamanlis abruptly exiled himself to paris . no
watchdog . though conservative karamanlis was the ablest premier in
recent greek history, king paul and queen frederika considered him
highhanded (he thought the same of the queen) ; they also opposed his
ideas of reforming the constitution to give the premier stronger
executive powers . in june, when they rejected karamanlis' advice to
call off a scheduled state visit to britain because of possible leftist
demonstrations, he resigned and spent three months in a swiss villa .
returning to run for re-election, he was narrowly defeated by wily,
middle-of-the road george papandreou, 75 . karamanlis wanted to quit
then, but was dissuaded by his political allies and the king, who
convinced him that as leader of his majesty's loyal opposition he would
be democracy's watchdog . but karamanlis wanted to be top dog, and he
growled at each new move that boosted papandreou's popularity . the new
premier froze rents, lavishly promised all greeks a free education,
declared a moratorium on farmers' debts, offered wage boosts to just
about everybody . he gave up the premier's limousine ( " we can build
four village schools with the money " ), opened his office once a week
to petitioners who swamped him with gripes, job requests, even demands
to speed up their divorces . though anti-communist papandreou also
managed to please leftists . he promised to free most of the 1,000
political prisoners, in jail since the end of the communist civil war
in 1949 . he also complained, accurately, that the greek defense
budget, amounting to 5 per cent of its gross national income, is higher
than that of other small nations, in nato, called for more foreign aid
actually, the u.s . is planning cutbacks) . triumphal return ? though
some economists hopefully predicted that papandreou's spending spree
will be covered by rising national income, greek businessmen were
uneasy . when king paul, siding with the new premier, agreed to
postpone a parliamentary vote of confidence, karamanlis fumed ; he
charged that in delaying the early test of strength, the king was
submitting to " blackmail " by papandreou, who implicity threatened
that his defeat might cause political disorder and help the left .
finally, karamanlis summoned his closest political aide and told him :
/ i'm retiring and leaving greece tomorrow . " he booked space under a
false name on a flight to paris . only after karamanlis and his wife
had departed did his national radical union get the word . stunned,
they elected a new party chairman and took whatever comfort they could
from a letter their leader had left behind : " when a statesman knows
what is best for his country but cannot carry it out, he must, instead
of compromising with his conscience, retire . " karamanlis apparently
hopes that if papandreou makes a mess of things he can return from
exile in triumph . in the event of new elections, his supporters are
ready to campaign under the slogan " bring karamanlis back . " as for
papandreou, he claims to be looking forward to a new vote, confident of

australia asians, keep out ! , underpopulated australia spend
$30 million in 1963 to attract new citizens, since war's end has
increased its population from 7.5 million to a mere 11 million . that
adds up to fewer inhabitants than pennsylvania has, in an area 66 times
larger . nonetheless, australia clings to some of the world's most
restrictive immigration laws, has traditionally discriminated against
asian and other nonwhite immigrants in order to preserve what
immigration minister alexander downer has described as " an anglican
european community embodying all that is best of the old world and the
new . " australia's " immigration apartheid " dates from the latter
half of the 19th century, when 50,000 chinese flocked there to work
farms and gold mines . white colonists, fearful that the newcomers
would depress wage levels, clamored for restrictive laws . today fewer
than 80,000 asians live permanently in the country, and experience
little racial discrimination, but only a few " distinguished and highly
qualified asians " are ever granted residence permits . whim creek .
the white australia policy is often carried to absurd, esoteric
extremes . recently, five japanese technicians employed by a
japanese-controlled mining concern at, of all places, whim creek in
western australia were convicted of violating an obscure 1904 law
specifying that " no asiatic or african alien shall be employed in any
capacity whatever in or about any mine claim . " as a result, western
australia's state legislature last week repealed the law, but virtually
negated its action by adopting an amendment specifying that asians must
still get government permits to work in the mines . there is even less
hope for liberalization of national immigration policies, whose
principal victims are the parents and children of mixed marriages . one
typical case this month involved an indian couple who came to australia
in 1962 to live with their two sons, both of whom are married to
australian girls, only to be ordered out of the country . said the
father : " i've found hell in australia . " skeptical neighbors .
critics of the white australia policy, including leading churchmen and
educators, object that only through selective asian immigration can the
government hope to attract all the skilled citizens it needs .
moreover, they argue, australia can never realize its potential as a
leader of southeast asia so long as its neighbors are convinced that
australians are white supremacists . prime minister sir robert menzies
in fact ordered more liberal interpretation of immigration policy, but
he insisted during the recent election campaign that he would never
permit any basic reform in the law . to do so, said he, " would create

of glowing charcoal braziers warmed the approach to the oberbaum
bridge, and two brightly lit christmas trees guarded its western end .
on the other side of the river spree, even the trigger-happy east
german vopos wore grins above their cradled submachine guns . only till
midnight . ironically, communism's grudging christmas present to west
berlin seems to have originated in the toy factory of nikita
khrushchev, who resembles santa claus only in shape . chilled by the
reception east germans gave him last summer at the wall, and aware that
the spirit of detente had not yet thawed the frozen pivotal point in
east-west relations, khrushchev talked east german boss walter ulbricht
into opening negotiations for the christmas visits . ulbricht was
apparently in no mood to be generous . the hole in the wall is a tiny
one by any measurement . only those west berliners who have immediate
relatives in the communist part of the city may pass through the five
special entry points designated by the east germans . passes, issued by
east german postal officials, are good through jan . 5, but only from 7
a.m . to midnight, except on new year's day when the pass holders may
stagger back as late as 5 a.m . though some 800,000 west berliners
qualify for the passes, many of them are fluchtlinge refugees from east
germany who would be nabbed by the vopos the moment they crossed the
wall and therefore will not dare to try it . tears & brandy . but
despite restrictions and red tape, some half a million west berliners
will probably make the sentimental journey before the holiday season
ends many of them more than once . tears and brandy flowed as the first
visitors crossed the wall . grandparents sized up snow-suited
two-year-olds they had never seen except in photographs . " does the
baby meet the family standards ? " asked one proud west german mother
. " ja, schon, " wept the grandmother . although the west berliners
arrived laden with everything from lebkuchen to long underwear, not all
the gifts came from their side of the wall . one east german lad blew a
year's savings on two geese, a sweater and a bottle of brandy to
welcome his long-immured relatives . some western diplomats felt the
communist christmas present was wrapped in blackmail, nervously awaited
ulbricht's next move . but though the hole in the wall will be sealed
up after the holiday season, it will never seem so impenetrable again .
after this brief, tantalizing breach, the wall's ugly masonry will look
all the more intolerable to east and west berliner alike .

russia    "we too are people"   not since the trotskyite riots in the
1920's had moscow seen anything like it.  while crowds of russians
watched with amazement, more than 400 african students last
week battled red cops in the streets, inside red square itself,
right past nikita khrushchev's own office window .
"moscow -- a second alabama," said one crudely lettered sign,
in russian and english . "stop killing africans," warned
another placard . mourning bands . the race riot was
touched off by the mysterious death of edmond asare-addo, 29,
a second-year medical student from ghana who was
studying at kalinin institute, about 100 miles northwest of the
capital . on the eve of his marriage to a russian girl, the student's
body was discovered near the railroad tracks of a suburban moscow
station . the soviet police claimed that asare-addo, drunk, had
fallen down in the 11 degree-below-zero weather and frozen to
death . but ghanaians, who knew that the marriage was fiercely opposed
by the girl's russian friends, insisted that the youth was stabbed
below the chin and tossed into the snow . quickly swinging into action,
students at patrice lumumba friendship university spread the word to
other africans in leningrad, kalinin, and as far away as odessa and
tashkent . the message:  we march on the kremlin . wearing the
traditional red mourning band of ghana around their heads, the students
gathered before the ghana embassy on a street a mile from red square .
"no trouble," shouted their leaders as the procession trooped off, but
at the end of the street, there was plenty . soviet police had
barred the way with trucks and cars . when the cops refused to budge,
the crowd began rocking a police car, intending to flip it over .
anxious to avoid bloodshed, and out-numbered 100 to 1, the police gave
way after a brief scuffle . as english-speaking russian
youths -- members of the young communist league -- blocked the view
from western photographers, the students regrouped, marched
through the heart of moscow singing freedom songs . but the police
regrouped too, and near red square, officials commandeered more
trucks to block the entrance . loudspeakers blared "entry to red square
is closed," but the africans squeezed through a space between two
trucks; as two students dropped a policeman with a flying tackle,
other marchers grappled with cops on top of the vehicles .
"it's natural ." once again police gave way . the horde raced across
red square, up an incline not far from nikita's window (he was out
inspecting an economics exhibition), past lenin's granite mausoleum, and
on toward the historic spassky gate that leads to the inner kremlin
grounds . at that moment the huge iron gates clanged shut . using
sound trucks, the police pleaded with the students to disperse, but for
two more hours they argued and jostled with police . ogling the
demonstration were thousands of russians, who watched from the street
and from the windows of gum, the big state-owned department store,
until employees curtained off the uncomradely scene .
finally about 100 students were allowed to interview soviet minister of
higher education vyacheslav eliutin, who promised an investigation of
the student's death . it was a stormy, two-hour session, with africans
demanding an end to all forms of official discrimination . "african
students get beaten up every day," one protested . "and soviet
policemen do nothing ."
neither did ghana's ambassador to moscow j.b. elliot . next day, as
students again massed near the embassy, he closed the building (for
"repairs" to damaged furniture), raised no objection as police herded
the angry ghanaians away . elliot tried to laugh off the melee,
dismissed talk of widespread bias against students as nothing but
"rumors ." relations with soviet students are cordial, he insisted .
"but it's natural to take a punch at each other ."
futile protest . even kremlin propagandists did not make that
nonsensical claim . instead, the russians clamped a tight censorship
on the embarrassing affair, for two days did not print or broadcast one
word about the riot all moscow was talking about . finally,
izvestia issued a stern warning to the students, told them to "respect
soviet laws" or get out of the country . prague has erupted in two
race riots within two years . last february in sofia, bulgarian
militiamen wielded clubs against 200 ghanaians who were marching down
the main street demanding nothing more than their own campus
organization . in moscow, africans have been smoldering for years
over thinly disguised racial discrimination . except for a token number
of russian students, the dining rooms and dormitories of lumumba u .
(which africans sardonically call "apartheid u .") are segregated .
africans find it difficult to date a russian girl . students squirm
at the stares they get in public and object to poor service they often
receive in restaurants . despite professions of brotherhood, many
russians still think africans are half-civilized strangers who have
just emerged from the jungle . " we too are people, not animals," cried
one sign carried by students who surged through moscow's streets last
week . to which one russian replied, obviously groaning under the weight
of the imperialist white man's burden:  "we help them and give them
an education . then they turn against us ."

communists       the sphinx anyone?  the most reluctant
rubberneck in egypt last week was communist china's premier chou
en-lai . granted only three sessions with president nasser during
his week's sojourn in cairo, chou was propelled relentlessly
through the list of vip tourist attractions:  an automobile plant,
a museum, egypt's military academy, the aswan dam . when his
hosts insisted on a close-up inspection of the sphinx, chou asked
plaintively:  "do i have to go?  i've already seen it from a
distance ." though the visit to egypt was only the first leg of his
scheduled two-month swing through africa, the round of sightseeing
clearly tired the ailing, 67-year-old chou . for the first time,
westerners noticed that he has only partial use of his right arm,
which was usually clutched tightly over his stomach . at one point,
after climbing a flight of stairs at an aswan power station, the
ashen-faced premier staggered off into a corner as if he were about
to faint . one of two doctors in his entourage hurried over and
appeared to give him a whiff of smelling salts . as chou raised his
head, blood trickled from his nose . "it happens whenever he gets
tired," shrugged one of his aides . "it is not serious, but that
is why he always has a doctor with him ." chou nonetheless had
plenty of energy for speechmaking, harped repeatedly on the peking
version of moscow's we-will-bury-you refrain . indeed, to
hear chou, the afro-asians will bury not only the west, but russia as
well . "the asian and african peoples," he proclaimed, "through
their labor and intellect created illustrious civilizations which were
demolished by imperialist aggression and tyranny . now that we have
broken the imperialistic shackles, we will be able to work new
miracles ." for all his eagerness to win african support for peking's
side in the sino-soviet conflict, however, chou could offer little
cash to the underdeveloped countries . in some areas that the
chinese have cultivated, they may even end by making more
enemies than friends . by lending somalia $20 million to buy arms for
its campaign to grab adjacent territory, peking has angered neighboring
kenya, where it has also spent heavily to woo the new nation . it may
succeed at least in raising russia's ante in africa and asia . at
week's end, as chou left for algeria, nikita khrushchev was
reportedly planning his own swing through africa . before
visiting cairo next spring, he may also junket to india and
nepal on chou's back doorstep . then it will be nikita's turn
to tell who will bury whom .

cold war     improved balance      any surprises at nato's year-end
ministerial conference in paris were purely accidental . an
elevator got stuck in the headquarters of the alliance, briefly
trapping a dozen photographers . then u.s . defense secretary robert s .
mcnamara narrowly missed sudden death when the four-engine jet
carrying him from orly airport to saigon braked to a jolting stop on
the runway, just in time to avoid collision with an incoming plane .
as for the meeting of nato's defense, finance and foreign
ministers, it went so smoothly that the session adjourned after
only two days, a day ahead of schedule . gentle reminder .
mcnamara, impressive as usual, ticked off a few awesome facts of
u.s . nuclear power:  more than 2,000 atomic warheads ready in case
of war, a 100 per cent increase in two years; 500 sac bombers and
500 intercontinental missiles, with 1,000 more missiles by 1966;
a new 155-mm . nuclear howitzer to boost the power of army ground
forces, whose manpower has been raised by 45 per cent within two
years . in a gentle but unmistakable reminder to u.s . allies, the
pentagon chief said that unless they hiked their own contributions
to nato, congress and u.s . public opinion would become increasingly
restless over washington's far heavier share of the western defense
burden . in a sense, the familiar discussion of military
preparedness was overshadowed by nato's "general recognition," as
secretary-general dirk stikker summed it up, "of change in the
atmosphere of world affairs ." british foreign secretary r. a . butler
echoed a common view that in the wake ofthe kremlin's retreat in
the cuban missile crisis, the soviets "have renounced the policy
of high risks in dealing with the west ." u.s . secretary of state
dean rusk, while warning that the communists could create new dangers
with unpredictable and perilous speed, hinted that the array of
problems facing russia may make it far easier for the west to reach
agreements with the reds . the problems include the deeply
significant rift with red china, the slackening of revolutionary ardor
at home, and the soviet union's growing domestic economic troubles .
jane's verdict . nikita khrushchev has stretched his nation's
resources dangerously thin, the 1964 and 1965 budgets published in
moscow last week showed sharp cutbacks in plans for such key
sectors of heavy industry as steel and electric power in order to
divert massive additional funds to the lagging agriculture program
and the backward chemical industry . perhaps the lack of capital
was also the cause of the declining rate in russia's air and space
spectaculars . the latest edition of jane's all the world's aircraft
lists only one new soviet plane for 1962 -- a high altitude
reconnaissance plane like the u-2 . jane's also suggested that
russia's his and her space-twin flights "failed to achieve all their
objectives, which may have included orbital rendezvous," pointed out
that the russians, in addition, lost contact with their rocket probe of
mars . u.s  . projects, although begun with more modest objectives,
far exceeded expectations, the report stated, citing major gordon
cooper's 22-orbit flight and the mariner ii probe that relayed a
wealth of data about venus . "with the great saturn booster due to
become operational in 1964-65," jane's added, "the suggestion
that america and the soviet union should work together on major
projects like lunar exploration is both timely and sensible now that the
prospective partners are attaining a measure of equality .

has been mostly bad . the communist viet cong have scored alarming
gains in vital long an province south of saigon, which feeds the
capital . for all the fanfare with which they were welcomed by diem's
critics, the generals who succeeded the slain president have
demonstrated an unsettling lack of political leadership; recently, the
civilian chiefs of nine northern provinces relayed a plea to junta

from the nato meeting in paris to saigon, for his second viet nam
inspection visit in three months . joined by u.s . central

briefings at the u.s . military mission . then he spent an
afternoon conferring with big minh and the other junta chiefs . under
discussion were plans for a major new offensive against the viet cong .
before boarding his plane for home, mcnamara turned to vietnamese

india     sea lawyer     ever since red china's surprise attack a
year ago, india's traditional policy of neutrality has been more
honored in words than in deeds . while mounting the old homilies about
nonalignment, india has petitioned the west for $1.5 billion in
military aid and has agreed to a western air-defense umbrella . last
week the u.s . seventh fleet prepared to take up positions in the
indian ocean . the question was broached to indian prime minister
jawaharlal nehru by chairman of the joint chiefs of staff maxwell d .
taylor on a visit to india last week . under the proposal, a task
force of one aircraft carrier with nuclear bomb-carrying jets
and four escort ships would patrol in the indian ocean for two to
four months at a time . supplied by support vessels, the task
force would never have to tie up at any indian port for provisions .
predictably, the seventh fleet proposal stirred up protests . the
indian press maintained that the plan was another threat to indian
neutrality, pakistan claimed that it was a hostile gesture on the
part of both countries, and red china said that it was another
example of the subversion of india by western imperialists . as for
nehru, he performed like a sea lawyer in lukewarmly endorsing the plan .
"how can we object to anyone going where he likes on the high seas," he
asked .

cambodia     the slumbering prince     former u.s . secretary of state
dean acheson is one of the most highly esteemed americans in
pnom penh . the reason dates back to last year, when acheson
successfully
represented cambodia before the international court of justice in the
hague in a territorial dispute with thailand . last week the u.s .
tried to capitalize on this friendship in an effort to end its acerbic
and somewhat mysterious little quarrel with cambodia's vain,
unpredictable leader, prince norodom sihanouk . the u.s . was rudely
rebuffed . sending acheson out to cambodia on a peacemaking mission
would be fine, declared the prince, but only on three conditions : 1)
that washington apologize for the u.s . diplomat who described as "
barbarous " radio cambodia's tasteless comments on john f . kennedy's
assassination, 2) a formal withdrawal by u.s . diplomats of a question
asking whether the " cambodian government had rejoiced over kennedy's
death, " 3) and the closing down of a radio station that sihanouk
claimed was run by cia in laos or thailand for the purpose of sending
subversive broadcasts into cambodia . washington termed sihanouk's
conditions " totally unacceptable . " in fact, sihanouk is probably
only taunting the u.s . out of fear of the red chinese and wants to
avoid an overt diplomatic break . sihanouk is still anxious for a
geneva conference to guarantee cambodian neutrality, but such a
conference is meaningless without u.s . participation . as sihanouk
himself said last week after closing cambodia's embassy in london, " it
appears necessary, without a diplomatic break, to put our relations in
slumber . /

south korea fatigues to flannels seoul was decked in all
its festive finery last week as south korea observed the end of two
years, seven months and one day of military dictatorship . buses were
garlanded with wreaths and newly made flags decorated storefronts and
streetcars . the midnight curfew was lifted for the day, and 5,000
prison inmates were released on amnesty . in a bone-chilling drizzle
before the national capitol building, 15,000 shivering spectators
watched former military strongman general park chung hee, 46, take the
oath of office as south korea's fifth civilian president . promising
never " to permit the resurgence of dictatorship under any disguise or
pretext, " park said :. " the bright morning of the new republic has
dawned . let us put depression, melancholy, confusion and pessimism
behind us and create a new history of optimism and determination . "
despite park's ringing words, the only real change in south korea's
government is from military fatigues to civilian flannels . under the
new constitution, the president has almost dictatorial powers, and
though park's democratic-republican party garnered only 34 per cent of
the vote in the national assembly elections, the opposition was so
split that the d.r.p . has a whopping, 45-seat parliamentary plurality
. though park pleaded for national unity, opposition leader yun po sun,
who barely lost the presidential election, boycotted the assembly's
opening session, and other dissident assemblymen threatened to
investigate the corruption prevalent under park's military junta . far
more menacing to park is south korea's chaotic economy . in the past
year, retail prices have climbed 40 percent, and some 10 per cent
of the labor force is unemployed . foreign exchange reserves have
plummeted to $105 million . desperate for a new dollop of u.s .
economic aid, park invited a u.s . congressional delegation to his
innauguration . but the u.s . has slashed next year's total aid
commitment by $54 million to $236 million, hopes to pressure park into
stabilizing the economy . a continuing dictatorship in south korea is
not very palatable to the u.s . but with his dictatorial powers, park
can at least promise a degree of political stability .
