critically examines the indian library scene. the management, operation, and
services of most libraries is inefficient and ineffective, resulting in grave
misallocation and underutilisation of library resources. little major research
has been carried out. university librarianship courses are not much help for
managing and operating libraries efficiently. the major national institutions
have serious limitations. to improve the situation, proposes the establishment
of an indian council of library and information services research and
training. the council would be set up by the government and have well-defined
roles and functions covering all aspects of indian librarianship.

personal view of the service, based on observations made during work under the
voluntary services overseas scheme. in kasama, the provincial centre of the
northern province, 3 major problems faced library services-poor transport; the
legacy left by an acting librarian who had operated his own kind of library
service which was extremely confused ; and the lack of provision for the
practical training of newly qualified staff. improvements need to be made to
the system in terms of authority, development, transport, training,
professional status and promotional activities.

the 46th ifla conference (manila, aug 80), the 1st held in a developing
country, aroused unusual interest among filipino librarians and media. ifla's
objectives of extending international understanding, cooperation, debate,
research and development in all fields of librarianship, currently through its
programmes universal bibliographic control and universal availability of
publications was emphasised. access to information is essential for a
country's social and economic development, final responsibility for this
resting with the government. while the year of the child must be followed up
especially in developing countries, the year of the disabled is a reminder
that handicapped people in all countries lack equal opportunities with other
reading groups. worldwide economic difficulties must not inhibit the search
for new ideas. challenges all library organisations to focus attention in 1981
particularly on the library need of blind and other handicapped readers.

summary of an ma thesis submitted to the school of library, archive and

librarians were sent questionnaires on the main factors which influenced their
choice of librarianship as a career and their opinions on the profession in
relation to training and education. 77 responded. 58 were 24-37 years old; 59
were female; 68 had a university education; 49 chose librarianship after they
finished at university; most landed in the profession by accident; all
favoured further professional training (most preferred to go abroad to gain
wider experience and adsorb new ideas); 23 would advise their children to be
librarians; 29 had professional qualifications when 1st appointed; 47 had
worked only in their present libraries; and most liked their libraries but
expressed dissatisfaction with salary and promotion prospects.

report on the draft code of professional ethics produced by the library
association working party on ethics. librarians and information workers in the
uk are latecomers to the question of professional ethics. a us code was
developed in 1938, and other professions have had codes since the 19th
century. the overriding reason for such a code is the protection of the
client, but it also offers protection for the professionals themselves, and
could enhance the status of the profession. at the very heart of the la code
is responsive and responsible professionalism.

critique of the draft code on professional ethics produced by the library
association. the code is badly written, confused, silly, contradictory and
threatens to bring the la into disrepute. notes provide little illumination;
codes of ethics do not per se bring professionalism; a librarian's primary
duty is often to a corporate body; there is confusion about possible conflicts
in service; and the library association is impudent in suggesting that it will
impose sanctions on those who fail to keep abreast of developments in
librarianship. suggests that the working party would do well to refer to the
american library association code.

the existing definitions of 'the subject of library science' are reviewed and
several scientific approaches to the definition of the subject of a scientific
discipline are discussed. it is suggested that the subject of library sciences
can be described as 'the laws governing the processes associated with and
related to the use of books', and the subject of special librarianship as 'the
laws governing the processes associated with and related to the use of books
in special libraries'. believes that 'special librarianship' is not an
independent discipline and argues that there is only one discipline called
'library science' and that the theoretical principles of soviet librarianship
apply to all libraries.

text of a paper given at the annual joint conference of the library
association of ireland, and the library association, n. ireland branch, held
in blarney, county cork in may 80. examines some likely areas of concern of
professional education for librarians in the 1980s, including: the need for
more training in the management of the new technology; the increasing
importance of information skills, particularly those associated with
computerised information retrieval; and the increasing importance of
collection development and the associated arts of book selection. argues that
the present uk one year post graduate course for librarians is not long

in the usa, uk and communist countries, library science is now fully
established as a scientific discipline and included amongst university
faculties. since the 19th century, however, opinion in west germany has been
divided as to whether library science has its own theoretic basis or whether
it consists of purely practical knowledge. examination of the respective
arguments suggests that library science can be regarded as an applied science
closely linked with other disciplines, e.g. information science,
communication, cybernetics and linguistics. historical aspects of
librarianship emphasised hitherto should play only a subordinate role; the
main emphasis must be on scientifically based, economic library administration
linked with research. cologne is the only german university possessing a
library science faculty; more such faculties are needed to produce librarians
of the required calibre.

the national library of canada music division's principal aim is to build the
national collection of musical canadiana. its responsibilities in other areas
are the world's basic printed literature on music, literature most likely to
be borrowed by smaller libraries, and the essential background literature for
canadian music studies. it also receives gifts from foreign governments and
acquires rare material by canadian interest in danger of being scattered or

describes the process of measuring the quality of public library services,
particularly in the light of the british government's intention to introduce a
process whereby local government must disclose information about its costs and
performance to the public, with the result that expenditure by local
authorities is reduced to the lowest spending authority's level, and not to
the level of the authority providing the highest quality services. measures
should reflect the desired outcome of the services offered, and librarian's
attempts to audit their work will improve their understanding of what they are
trying to do for society.

a survey of all 166 public library authorities in the uk was carried out to
determine whether librarians take as much care in preserving the
correspondence, memoranda, plans, minutes and other records of the past, as
they do in preserving information about all sorts of other organisations. in
many cases there was evidence of a lack of clearly thought-out policies.

public libraries, which were published recently in the netherlands by the
nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and
literature), has aroused much opposition from local authorities. the report
was submitted by the nblc to the government, which is responsible for only 20%
of public library finance. the local authorities, which are responsible for
the remaining 80%, will be required to raise large sums of money from local

during the last 13 years of the 20 years' existence of mobile library service
in finland this service has become of considerable importance. there is a
mobile library standard and the finnish library association has set up a
mobile library working group. training of drivers has been neglected although
they deal with the bulk of the loans. the mobiles, until the introduction of
the standard, were uncomfortable and wasteful in energy, and had a short life.
this year 4.5 million f marks will be spent on new mobiles by about 12 local
authorities. 40 authorities have applied for a grant. the following aspects of
a mobile service need developing: improved services and their rationalisation,
training of drivers, cooperative purchase of mobiles by 2 or more authorities.

the norwegian library system is currently in a phase of stagnation, partly due
to economic factors, but also because of uncertainties in several areas.
discussion continues on the introduction of computerisation, and a
rationalisation programme, now over 10 years old, is attempting to apportion
functions and financial responsibility between government and local
authorities. county libraries, with their triple task of advisory service,
inter-library lending, and mobile library service, are particularly
vulnerable. these services, which benefit public libraries, school libraries
and individual readers, could be adversely affected by some rationalisation
proposals. the first 2 could be maintained and improved if county libraries
were made national institutions attached to large municipal libraries. mobile
services are poorly developed in norway, partly because not all areas are
geographically suitable. a restructuring of th e country's library system is
urgently needed, and county librarians must evaluate their own position and
services.

in 1972 a survey of libraries in colleges of higher professional education in
the netherlands revealed a low standard of library provision. as a result the
state library advisory council has published a number of proposals for the
improvement of services. modern trends in higher education, such as increased
student numbers and new methods in teaching, have had a profound effect on the
colleges of higher professional education. libraries of these colleges must
now become information centres, easily accessible to all students and equipped
with adequate catalogues. college librarians will need to pay increasing
attention to the acquisition of reports, conference proceedings and
audio-visual materials and should provide courses of formal instruction for
staff and students in the use of library services.

fewer purchases than last year were made but staff are catching up on the

key role in university planning. because of processing, storage and running
costs, each book costs more than its purchasing price; the use of electronic

examines the ways in which the interests of promoting libraries and the
promotion of higher education converged in the development of french
university libraries in the 19th century. the revolution of 1789 abolished
universities and confiscated their libraries. the imperial university, an
educational bureaucracy that survived the empire and endured for most of the
19th century, did not promote research or require research libraries. however,
in 1855 efforts began to replace the imperial system with autonomous
universities, and these efforts focused on the role of university libraries.
in 1881 university libraries were created in the provinces as a 1st step
toward creating universities, 15 years before the de jure establishment of
universities.

libraries belonging to the university. some of the others are the central
agricultural, the central forestry, and the central medical library. the
slavic collection contains russian books obtained by legal deposit between
1828 and 1917. it is the largest collection of its kind in the west. soviet
literature is added to the collection regularly. the bibliographic department
receives 5 copies of all books published in finland every 6 months. this

reviews the history and development and discusses the current work of the
scientific library of tomsk university. when founded, in 1880, the library had
a stock of approximately 96,000 items consisting of valuable collections of
books, which were either purchased or which the library received as gifts.
initially the use was not very effective: during its first 10 years the
library handled on average only 5,000 loans per year. staff worked under
extremely difficult conditions during the period 1941-44 when a herbarium and
a museum were moved into its premises. in addition, during that period the
library looked after the archives of a.m. gor'kii, l.n. tolstoi and a.s.
pushkin. despite the difficult conditions, staff not only managed to continue
their work but the library also provided a service to wounded soldiers
receiving treatment in tomsk. the library has currently a stock of 3, 5
million items in more than 50 languages and an extensive collection of
periodicals. in 1969 the library became a methodological centre for 46
academic libraries. it organises over 300 book exhibitions a year.

pre-clinical medicine, with a wide range of textbooks, reference works and
basic literature in their own subjects and an introduction to the literature
of other disciplines. the library cooperates actively with other libraries,
organising the production of a union catalogue with other university institute
libraries and participating in the direct ordering and supply service of the
national technical university library. library stocks now total 4,000 books
and 300 current periodicals. the dobis/libis on-line system is used in the
search for and input of information, accessions, cataloguing and loans. the
library's most urgent tasks are expansion of stock and completion of the union
catalogue.

a decline in the uk birth rate, the assumption that few teachers would be
needed and an attempt to broaden the base of education have led to the
appearance of colleges and institutes of higher education, formed as many
colleges of education closed and others merged with polytechnics and other
institutions. the libraries are as varied as the colleges themselves, and a
lack of published standards makes library planning difficult. with staff
doubled or trebled by amalgamations there is a paramount need for professional
staff to think seriously about the most effective use of staff and resources.
the potential for training and educating a substantial number of the country's
workforce in the ches is enormous.

discusses the standard of the provision made by uk public libraries for the
disadvantaged, and argues that, whilst libraries have largely responded to the
needs of the institutionally disadvantaged (eg hospital patients, the
handicapped, and prison inmates), the socially and culturally disadvantaged
have been largely ignored. identifies a basic dichotomy which has 2 aspects:
the disparity between levels of provision for various disadvantaged groups;
and the disparity between service to the disadvantaged and service to the
community at large. reports criticisms which have been made of the inadequacy
of the work done by libraries with ethnic minorities, in deprived areas, and
with relation to functional literacy and the encouragement of reading.

emotional identification, to educate, especially ideologically. some norwegian
communities still maintain strict ethical and religious book selection

shows how after initial hesitation, the library and school found how to adapt
to and complement each others' activities; the 2nd describes a less successful
project, where eventually functions had to be prescribed for the library as a
result of its failure to develop its own sphere of activity. the last article

function; the pre-eminence of danish school libraries in scandinavia; the need
for norwegian authorities to carry out the intentions of the library act; and
school libraries' important role in scandinavian cultural cooperation. topics
included a forward view of the school's aims and curriculum; the challenge of
supplying suitable education for each individual child in the 1980s; the
staffing question, teacher training being seen as more valuable than advanced
library studies; the new term 'media centre', aptly describing the true
function of a school library; and fairy tales in education. the school library
is an important aid towards learning other scandinavian languages at the
earliest possible age. essentials in norway are: a sufficient allowance of
time for the school librarian in the curriculum; adequate education for school
librarians; and information and discussion on the norwegian school library

in papua new guinea the majority of the population now is being educated, and
community information centres, such as libraries, are needed to provide the
information which people require to keep up with day-to-day events. such a
centre should also provide information to help people to improve their daily

made of existing libraries, and most of the country's libraries are in

the society stated that a library should be established to act as a depository
for all materials concerned with finnish culture. at present the staff numbers
8. there are 185,000 books in stock and in 1969 14,581 books were loaned while
in 1978 the figure was 35,541. about 1/2 of the users of the library are
students and staff of the helsinki university. the library receives a state
grant. most of the finnish acquisitions are free. the library has an ethnology
department which also includes foreign materials in the field. the other main
department of the library is that of literary research. the main functions of
the society are to provide research facilities and to act as a publisher.

an investigation of primary periodicals that appeared in references selected
from chemical abstracts condensates was carried out on the output for about
2,000 profiles. frequency lists, in alphabetical and rank order, were created
for the data obtained in the course of routine processing of 2 volumes: 86 and
89. in both issues, a relatively small number of journals, for example, 212
and 220 out of 6,209 and 7,039 titles, respectively, supplied 50% of the
relevant papers for sdi users. the method is described, and the results are

following a 1979 study tour covering 6 local history archives in denmark,
relationships, joint functions and finance of such archives and local history
collections are discussed. the 1st local history archive in denmark was
established in faborg in 1937; by 1979 there were about 240. a 1978 report
defined material belonging respectively to local history collections and local
history archives, recommending coordination by the library but considerable
autonomy for the archives. while details differ, cooperation seems generally
satisfactory. financial arrangements vary widely, still with many voluntary
archivists. with no comparable activity in norway, it seems necessary to
survey existing resources and institutions and evaluate the situation.
priorities are collection, arrangement and indexing, conservation, and
availability. public libraries, though the natural home for local history
archives, would require additional finance and staffing. local organisations
should  be approached, manpower and resources coordinated, and help sought
from regional and central authorities.

re-analyses a nation-wide survey of us adults conducted in 1970 for the
commission on obscenity and pornography to permit new comparisons of the large
majority who favoured library censorship of 'erotica' with the minority who
opposed it. as expected from previous studies, there were significant
differences between the 2 groups-for example, those opposing censorship were
younger, better educated, more open to mass media, and by a number of
measures, more liberal or permissive. the anticensorship position appears to
be part of a general liberal ideology that extends to such issues as racial
integration and evnironmentalism. further, the anticensorship group has much
in common with the group identified by other studies as users of public
libraries.

recent evaluations of the condition and funding of educational research in the
usa assumes that basic research in the social sciences is a crucial factor in
increasing understanding of and ultimately improving the practice of
education. past tests of this assumption, however, have generally relied upon
argument by example or anecdote. in this study, citation patterns in education
literature are analysed to test the corollary proposition that basic research
in the social sciences has had a substantial impact on education literature.
empirical data collected on citation patterns in the education literature are

the 1979/80 library guide to the aachen university library functions
simultaneously as a critique of conditions at the library. aachen is now a
university with almost 30,000 students but the library system is largely
decentralised with many small institute libraries. some of these have been
reorganised and rehoused, but many still need to be restructured. there is a
lack of centralisation and coordination which can be found out most of the
'old' north rhine-westphalia universities which are not planned, campus
universities. there is a need for a complete catalogue of library stock.
library guides such as the aachen example are of great valueand should be
published at all the libraries. it is also necessary to integrate small
institute libraries to improve coordination work. librarians are of the
opinion that libraries should be treated as individual cases and that plans
and laws for remodelling library conditions should beware of generalisation.

critical summary of the progress made in introducing a coordinated library
system at marburg university which was especially suited as a model for this
purpose because the central alphabetical catalogue had been in existence since
the 19th century and had been systematically extended since 1962; and new
buildings for many of the library facilities have led to excellent lending
conditions and close proximity between university buildings and library
services. the coordination programme aims at, and has partially realised the
integration of many small institute libraries into 28 library complexes with
52 independant library units. one important measure is the construction of a
central medical library integrating the present 37 department libraries. it is
possible to see that the programme initiated at marburg will lead to improved

at present produced in sections, should be taken over by the state. the free
lending principle is maintained. public libraries, after a 5-year transitional
period, should be wholly financed by the local authorities within 2 years.
music libraries should be obligatory. proposed changes for special libraries

the 1978 rhineland palatinate state law on universities has made the position
of university libraries more difficult than it was under the 1970 law with

various university bodies and their relationships with one another. detailed
analysis is made of the 1978 law and its relevance to the library, the legal
position of the library, its director and the senate and of individual legal
problems such as the authority for stock purchase, control of staffing and
finance, decisions on staffing made by the senate president, the library's
tasks outside the university and legal disputes between the library and other
university bodies. this analysis could prove helpful to university libraries

in the early 70s the fiscal outlook for indiana's public libraries was
abysmally depressing, with most libraries having no opportunity to participate
in the distribution of revenue-sharing funds. however, as the decade
progressed, several legislative bills favourable to public libraries were
enacted. these followed the revenue sharing act of 1972, which permitted
government units to appropriate funds only for the purposes for which their
own revenues were expended. in 1978, revenue-sharing funds increased
dramatically as a result of the state legislators' second attempt to provide
public libraries with access to revenue-sharing funds, with the passage of
senate-enrolled act no. 208. the optimistic outlook for the 80s is tempered
only by the concern of librarians about state legislators' commitment to
continue state funding of public libraries.

report by the freemantle city council urging the continuation of a free public
library service, in the face of suggestions by the local government
association that charges be levied for public library service. the public
library is of real value to the community, and an informed citizenry is
considered vital to the democratic process; information is necessary in
education and recreation. suggests the need for the maintenance of the
coordinated statewide library system in western australia to aid services in
terms of stock, economics, and manpower.

revised version of a lecture given at the university of tennessee library, 29
apr 80. offers practical advice to librarians on managing libraries during a
time of declining resources. urges librarians to put aside the extravagant
promises and empty rhetoric that characterised the 1960s and 1970s and to take
a more realistic view of the collections and services they can provide to
their users during the austere 1980s.

the advantages and disadvantages of automation in libraries are discussed.
concludes that there are real gains for users but that automation will not
solve all problems. automation should release qualified staff from routine
work and give them more time for specialised work.

no danish library is yet fully computerised, though individual projects are in
operation. specialised education, especially in-service courses, is necessary,
but librarians' complaints about computerisation may stem from several
physical and psychological factors not yet fully explored. staff may feel
ruled by the machine unless encouraged to understand the system thoroughly and
take part in organising work processes. in setting up samkat at the danish
national library, cataloguers have been fully involved in the 1st
(cataloguing) stage, and will take part in future development of the system to
ensure consistency. when staff feel at ease with the computer, its advantages
include making their work less strenuous but more stimulating (provided
good-quality print-outs are attained) and improving inter-library cooperation
and service to readers. librarians should remain responsible for their working
conditions, and introduce technological developme nts at a suitable tempo.

librarians have learnt that automation is more difficult and will take longer
than originally thought; some functions are better carried out through
networks; although computer-based systems are more powerful and more versatile
than the manual systems they replace, they can also be more expensive to
operate and maintain (at least during the transition period); and
computerisation imposes much higher standards of accuracy on library
operations. discusses problems and prospects for libraries and networks during
the next decade and suggests that the research libraries group, inc. (a
growing partnership of 25 libraries trying to collectively maintain and expand
their capabilities using new technology even in the face of diminishing
resources) could serve as a model and inspiration for other groups worldwide.

the micro computer system is not unique, but just a simpler version of the
mini and mainframe. it is only cheaper because less is provided, the
facilities are inadequate for many operations, and if significant once-off
programme development is required, most cost advantages of a micro system may
be lost. discusses questions which should be raised when considering micro
computer systems in the context of library automation and information
retrieval. suggests that processor, memory and logic boards should cost no
more than *62,000, and mass storage should be limited to floppy discs and/or
cassette.

.I  188
.W
recent advantages in large scale integration of electronic components and
attendant advances in mass storage technology opening the possibility of
automation for many small libraries that up until now could not afford to
automate. computers are also finding a place in libraries as a new kind of
media, purchased for use by their patrons. examines the actual and potential
applications of microcomputer systems in libraries, both in technical
services/library automation and in public services as a new form of media.

the academic library is becoming a no-movement, stable faculty with everyone
afraid, financially unable, or professionally incapable of moving. the library
manager could stop the faculty dying and help staff to develop professionally
by providing contract options, changing staffing patterns, rotating personnel,
offering leave of absence, and improving the work environment.

for many years researchers in the field of management have been studying,
testing, theorising and writing about job motivation, its causes and effects.
job motivation, which is the amount of effort directed toward attaining goals
desired by the organisation, is a subject about which all managers of people,
including librarians, must have some knowledge.

argues that staff development programmes and activities do not, in themselves,
motivate staff. they are seen as being catalytic in nature, needing to be
understood in the context of adult learning and motivation theory. suggests
ways of bringing about a renaissance in the library as a workplace which would
bring the 'quality of work life' movement to libraries. discusses managers'
and non-managers' roles, relationships and responsibilities for the creation
of an atmosphere conducive to growth, in the framework of the library
development process.

sees staff development as an effective means of enhancing the capabilities and
careers of library personnel, and presents a structure for viewing staff
development resources. proposes guidelines for: identifying, selecting and

a model of the staff development process, and discusses the following
important steps involved: needs analysis; objectives; criteria for evaluation;
climate analysis; climate conditioning; developing content and methods; and
implementation and evaluation. provides a case study of the application of the
staff development process in a library setting.

formal and ongoing training of computer searchers is fundamental to the
success of any computerised information service. argues that all library staff
should be educated in the use of computers for reference work so that computer
searching can be fully integrated into the normal everyday service. libraries
must not feel that they have failed if they decide to ask for a computer
search rather than hunt through books for themselves. briefly discusses the
advantages of on-line access to reference books and indexes to popular
periodicals and newspapers.

the history of librarianship reveals a considerable number of librarians who
have also been active as philosophers. it would appear that the librarian and
the philosopher must share a number of common characteristics. the most
striking of these characteristics is the unbounded thirst for knowledge. in
addition, although courses of study are available in both disciplines, the
knowledge and expertise of both librarian and philosopher is only acquired
after years of experience. both groups seek to create order in the material
which forms the focus of their activities and although not innovators
themselves, willingly offer themselves in the service of others.

notes the importance of studying job satisfaction within the context of
librarianship, and examines the relationship of age and tenure to the job
satisfaction of librarians. reviews some library literature on management, and
discusses briefly the findings of 5 empirical studies concerned with the job
satisfaction of library employees. describes the methods and results of an
empirical study designed to analyse the relationship between age, tenure, and
job satisfaction for 64 us professional librarians. the results revealed that
the librarians studied experienced relatively constant levels of job
satisfaction across 3 different age and tenure categories. the primary job
dissatisfaction noted related to age and satisfaction with supervision and
co-workers.

the author is of the opinion that the ground floor is the most important area
of any library building, and it should not be used for secondary activities.
in jyvaskyla library building, as in many finnish library buildings, the
actual library is accommodated above the ground floor level. a competition for
a design is normally organized. this was also the case in jyvaskyla. this is
not the way to get best results, because the cooperation between the architect
and the librarian only begins after the design is complete. an architect
should be chosen carefully and the librarian or a library expert and the
architect should cooperate throughout the design of the building.

fitted carpets have become popular in libraries because they cut down noise.
but if carpets are not kept clean and rooms well ventilated they can cause
problems for people suffering from respiratory ailments. new carpets do not
cause this trouble. research in sweden and finland shows that carpets stay
dirty even after good vacuuming. gives comparative figures for the amount of
dust caused by different types of floor coverings, which is what causes the
allergies.

principal cities, and in response, various major associations consulted at
length about the impact of the regulations and testified to the department.
the department was urged to exempt museums, archives, research libraries and
historic structures where the preservation of cultural and scientific heritage

describes: how to use entrances to attract potential users; how to use space
effectively; how to create assignable space; comfortable seating; avoiding
crowding and barriers; flexible design for technological change. as excess

lists some of the reasons why people do not make use of public library
services, and emphasises the need to encourage people to do so by, for
example, planning book exhibitions, film reviews, and recordings of readings.
such programmes should be made available to schools, colleges, museums and

increasing the public's awareness of a library's existence and services is
vital in any library community. in us rural areas there are many means of
communication at the librarian's disposal, including the local newspaper,
local radio, word-of-mouth communications by library staff, the county board
of education, and service clubs. only through communication with the public
can the rural public library increase its circulation and funding.

teachers play a significant role in promoting library usage. it is for the
teachers to take the lead in cultivating the reading habit, by giving students
library assignments to motivate them to use the library. the role of the
teacher and that of the librarian are closely related, and it is essential for
the teacher to know the librarian's job and promote library usage.

advice given covers transport and insurance; exhibition techniques; labelling;
posters and catalogues; security; regulation of entrance; reception of group

2 systems of statistical indices for evaluation of information work are
presented: system of primary indices for quantitative evaluation of individual
information tasks; and system of 'relative' indices which express the
relationship between individual parameters and which can be used to evaluate
the effectiveness of information services and to determine the amount of work
undertaken by information workers; the system can be used to carry out
comparative analyses of the activities of information centres. using these 2
systems, a complex method for evaluation of the work of branch information
centres was developed. the method employs an algorithm designed by the
computing centre of the siberian branch of the ussr academy of sciences. the
method was used to evaluate the work of 33 branch information centres; results
of the evaluation are presented.

when the united nations was established in 1945, serious efforts 1st began to
disseminate information on developing countries. the united nations has over
300 depot libraries, 14 of them in scandinavia. international development
agencies exist in all 5 scandinavian countries. in some countries information
is available from these agencies, but in others only from non-government
organisations. special libraries exist in several scandinavian institutions,
research being particularly concentrated on africa, asia and latin america.
several countries have specialised research institutes. supplementary
information must be sought in large general public and special libraries, and
from local humanitarian, political and religious organisations. a
pan-scandinavian bibliography of relevant data bases would be valuable.
librarians recognise a need for better organised documentation; library
associations in denmark, norway and sweden have establish ed committees of
developing countries. scandinavian national and regional committees on these
lines are desirable to coordinate accessions and establish area and subject
specialisation plans.

until well into the 70s traditional information channels were used when
dealing with information about social sciences. the expansion of research in
the area necessitated more planned information services. the slow development
of theses is due to the lack of financial resources, to the special nature of
social sciences, the needs of social scientists to obtain information outside
their field, to the unwillingness of social scientists to use information
services, and to the lack of standardised terminology in the field.

.I  236

many international organisations have participated in developing and
coordinating information services in social sciences. some of these
organisations have developed methods, and particular terminology. there is no
established division of work between these organisations. it is important that
information collected in different countries can be exchanged between
different systems. the more mechanical this exchange is the more economical
and faster it will be. unisist now also covers social sciences. a plan
published in 1972 includes unesco's programme for the development of
information services in social sciences. unesco also supports financially some
projects in the field, including ecssid programme. in 1975 oecd mapped the
available information services in the field in europe. between 1971 and 1980
the british disiss project looked at the information services in social
sciences and their quality. both projects concluded  that information services
have developed without any general long-term plan. 2 research projects in the

infrastructure, and the need to tie together isolated activities to maximise
benefits. it is developing as a regional and national operation with
activities integrated through a central coordinating unit. the 1st meeting of

political parties and local organisations are not using libraries to display
information. librarians themselves are passive about acquiring any materials

the financial times business information service, a natural off-shoot of the
uk newspaper financial times, was started in 1971. it has files on 60,000
companies, trade directories, extel cards, information on registered us
companies, a full-time agent at companies house, cuttings on 25,000 prominent
people, and detailed economic information. the minimum subscription is *6250,
some users spend *610,000 annually, and annual revenue is almost *63 million.
it publishes information spin-offs (newsletters, reports, and directories) and
has bought out and absorbed a potential competitor, mccarthy information
services (a very up-market press cutting service).

examines the development of the information industry and its consequences in
relation to organisational and economic problems. discussion covers the
following topics: the relatively weak role of scientific and technical
information in the new industry; the diverse nature of potential users; the
effects on information access; information services as the new market where
data bases are subsidiary tools; the necessity for international cooperation;
global and local effects on employment and personnel; the legal problems of

specialised information centres closely linked to research centres of
excellence in a given field seem to be the most viable solution to the
information explosion as far as developing countries are concerned. they
provide much-needed information, can reach users rapidly, and enable their
target scientific community to behave as a human infrastructure. the cassava
information centre at the centro internacional de agricultura tropical, cali,
colombia, provides consolidated information. information is selected, analysed
for reliability and equality, and fused into publications such as monographs,
state-of-the-art reviews, and directories. it also provides an abstracting
service. emphasis is on satisfying user needs rather than on the techniques
for doing so.

1 of the trends of the future development of the ussr state system of
scientific and technical information is standardisation of information work
and library tasks. approximately 50 standards are planned to be published
within the 11th 5-year plan. standards are being prepared by a number of
information departments attached to academic institutions and manufacturing
companies, thus the preparation of standards is not always sufficiently
coordinated. an analysis of the standardisation of various aspects of
information work was therefore carried out. its results show that it is
essential to prepare an unified plan of standardisation covering all aspects
of information work. methodological recommendations must be prepared in
cooperation with official bodies of the state system of scientific and
technical information and particular attention sh ould be paid to the
terminology used.

of action and especially its decisions regarding information services. there
was evidence, particularly among developing countries, of a great need for
information to help in the assessment and application of technology to
development and there was clearly a lack of knowledge about existing
information facilities. recommendations called on developing countries to make
their information resources more accessible to developing countries and called
for an international information exchange network. the network would make full
use of existing specialised information networks and consist of a series of
subnetworks in each developed and developing countries.

informal and formal communication processes are documented in the primary
journal literature. both processes impose structures on the authors who
publish their research, and the formal process imposes a structure on the
journals which publish scientific papers. it is shown that information theory

the introduction of computerised identification has alarmed many people in
denmark as elsewhere. under an 1978 act the national library office has
already encountered problems on cataloguing and authors' royalties. the main
question concerns the linking of borrower to book, though this was equally
possible with older issue systems. in 2 recent cases involving terrorism and
murder, libraries have reluctantly supplied police with information generally
regarded as confidential. the library office proposes an explicit statement of
librarians' duty to maintain confidentiality, abd stricter control of
out-of-date photographic issue records. when computer issue systems become
common, such information will be more easily obtained, and the danish library
commission considers that it should be made impossible to trace a borrower
once his book is returned. while this should be covered by the 1978 act, any
future revision of the library act should  state the position in unambiguous
terms.

part of earthwatch, its programme for the critical assessment of the global
environment. in operation since jan 77, it has a decentralised structure and
its national, regional and sectorial focal points and the infoterra programme
activity centre act as switchboards, connecting users with appropriate
information sources or (if their resources allow) sometimes providing
information directly to the user. infoterra is not a substantive information

an algorithm for perception of topological symmetry has been programmed for
computer use. the algorithm is based on the concept of the smallest binary
code for a graph and requires generation of all numberings for a structure
which will produce the canonical form for the adjacency matrix. the unique
adjacency matrix corresponds to the smallest possible (binary) number
representing the structure when its rows are read from top to bottom and from
left to right. operation of the program is illustrated with a selection of

data files containing information on solid-state materials are expanding
rapidly. each year several thousand new materials are characterised by x-ray
diffraction techniques. consequently, computer procedures have been developed
to register materials entering large data files. registration based on lattice
parameters and empirical formula is especially effective. the lattice is
uniquely represented by the reduced cell and the elements in the formula are
uniquely specified by prime numbers. this method has been applied for several
years to register new materials for the cambridge crystallographic data file
which contains data on more than 25,000 compounds containing organic carbon.
the method is now being adapted to register materials for the nbs crystal data

education (cije). a sample of 30 journal articles was taken from each tool in
the areas of educational psychology, school administration, and special
education; after an investigation of the characteristics of the displays of
thesaural descriptors in cije and the subject headings in education index, an
analysis was made of the topics under which each article was indexed in both
tools. the data analysis includes a quantitative description of the sample,
the structure of the 3 areas in education as found in both the thesaurus and
subject heading list, terminological characteristics, and a general summation
of findings. the thesaurus and its role in the retrieval of materials
utilizing educational terminology is discussed  along with problems
encountered in trying to index educational terms. report not available from

asu-ryhma, a pilot working group on a finnish subject heading list carried out
a survey in over 30 public libraries about the nature of enquiries in 1 month.
4,600 enquiries were listed. this figure includes enquiries over a longer
period in some of the libraries. a large majority of the enquiries concerned
non-fiction. the most popular subject areas were literature, law, music and
handicrafts. on pages 114 and 115 the types of enquiries are listed by broad
classification. a finnish subject heading list is needed urgently because of
the specific nature of many of the enquiries for which the classification
scheme used in public libraries cannot cater.

data are recorded on optical mark forms using a soft pencil to place a series
of marks in specified areas, a technique that is commonly used on examination
answer sheets. the data are then available for computer tabulation and
analysis. reference-desk statistics can efficiently be collected in
machine-readable form by using such a technique. information relevant to the
design of an optical mark form is presented along with important software
considerations. the overriding concern when designing an optical mark form to
be used at the reference desk is to provide the ability to record all
necessary information while requiring as few marks as possible. useful data
categories are identified, and figures illustrate how data can be recorded for
each category. presents information resulting from the design and use of such
a programme at the university library, university of nebraska at omaha.

the adoption of a multilateral international convention on the universal
availability of publications (uap) is the best possible guarantee for the
practical implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the unesco
uap conference to be held in 1981-82. this convention should declare the
principle of uap and should determine the basic obligations of national
governments in the creation of the national infrastructure of a uap system.
international issues to be considered are the roles of unesco and ifla,
formation of an international collection of publications, adjustments of
existing international agreements to the principles of uap, and provision for
a special unesco fund for uap. report not available from ntis.

formerly most information had to be obtained from original documents,
resulting in the recovery of only a few coincidental references. the use of
on-line techniques facilitates the making of global information surveys
independent of sources at hand. automated text processing reduces the need for
direct contact with published material and maintenance of original stocks. the
sulzer company uses automated text processing in ordering and supply of
information, for the catalogue, accessions index, periodical subscription
control and printing the periodical index; the computer system is described in
detail. control of periodical circulation is also being incorporated into the
system. thus work procedures have been reduced, leaving staff free for more
demanding tasks.

enables information to be transferred directly from the ohio college library
center (oclc) terminal to the computer for acquisitions, bookkeeping,
circulation and bibliographic searches, with very little manual intervention,
thus cutting down on staff numbers. 4 local character codes are added to oclc
records, identifying the vendor, requestor, the fund against which the
purchase is to be charged, and any special instructions. describes the use of
bar codes in the circulation system, updating the catalogue and acquisitions
procedure for books. savings are now being spent on new books.

of library spending by departments on patron welfare; then derives a formula
as the solution to the problem of maximising patron welfare subject to the
budget constraint that the sum of the allocations to the departments equals
the total fund available. according to the formula, the appropriate share of
each department depends on its numbers, its cost of literature, and on the

means of sending orders and hopefully eventually, cancellations and possibly
chasers. notes some of the implications of teleordering for librarians,
particularly the better service on supply of books and of reports. suggests

contribution to a special section on technology. although some wholesalers are
well ahead of the rest of the canadian book distribution industry in applying
new technology, they may have to change their approach if the distribution
process is to be automated. us automated systems are geared to fast service
from a nation-wide wholesale chain. canada has no such chain and wholesalers
may have to form a consortium. a central coordinating agency has been
suggested in a study by peat, marwick and mccarthy & mccarthy. many feel the

between 1970 and 78 the number of annual literature orders received from
outside by the central library of medicine in cologne increased by nearly 400%
to 210,000. since computerised information services expanded considerably
during this period, the library needed detailed information on requested
material for future planning, so in 1978 a survey was carried out with the
help of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (german research association).
information from 12 libraries was obtained on the sources of ordered
literature, the use of material by different professional groups, the use of
computer services, bibliographies and abstracts, the types and language of
material required and the type of library making the request. the survey's
central finding was that the activities of the computerised information
services considerably influenced user demand. libraries must cater for this
and their financing bodies must support them.

the north rhine-westphalia union catalogue office at the university library
centre published the 1979 report concerning external lending and borrowing
statistics. 175 libraries in the region were authorised lending libraries in
1979. the union catalogue office sent questionnaires to 273 libraries,
departments and grammar schools in the region. 270 of these were completed and
returned. the number of inter-library loans levelled off in comparison to the
high 1976 figures and dropped in some cases. there were some exceptions such
as the cologne zentralbibliothek der medizin which had a growth rate of 13%.
there was a rise in books ordered by libraries from other libraries of 3.7%. a
considerable difference between the number of books lent to other libraries in
west germany and abroad was evident. more books were borrowed by the regional
libraries than were supplied by them and the figures for books supplied

4 years ago the regional library of the voronezh state university introduced a
new method of using the printed cards of the all-union book chamber. in the
past, the library staff had to fill in 7 full sets of the cards, despite the
fact that only 20-30% of the cards were actually used in catalogues. instead
of full sets the library now uses serial sets. depending on the subject of the
catalogued document (for example literature on humanities is included in 3
catalogues), 1-8 copies of the serial set cards are filled in. their use
resulted in a considerable financial saving and in reduced labour consumption.

although full bibliographic access to non-print materials has been a goal of
libraries, complete success has not been achieved. the library at california
state university, los angeles, sought a way to access previously inaccessible
elements of its recordings collection. the computer-based media index was

(selections, composers, performers, etc.). this has proved to be an extremely
useful tool and is readily adaptable to other forms of mediated material.

a true on-line catalogue requires bibliographic records of at least 350-400
characters per title, a minimum of 6 access points, and a sufficient number of
terminals to offer all users prompt access. a library may develop an on-line
catalogue by purchasing software from another library or joining a turnkey
system whereby a company provides all hardware, software, installation,
training, and maintenance at a contracted price. issues to be considered when
examining the options include data base content, fullness of records,
authority control, access keys, boolean logic, user friendliness, display
formats, security, and back-up provision. libraries undertaking on-line
catalogues in 1981 are pioneers.

indexing with nominal phrases is a strict continuation of the development from
coordinate to syntactic indexing. nominal phrases are user oriented and
especially suitable for complex terms. a nominal phrase consists of a nucleus
with a left-hand and/or right-hand attribute. attribute and nucleus can occur
several times at the same hierarchic level. the use of nominal phrase indexing
is illustrated with descriptions of 3 manual indexing systems-titus, casin and
gerdok-and 1 automatic system-detect. in automatic indexing with nominal
phrases a complete syntactic analysis is unnecessary; even systems with
partial parsing routines produce acceptable results. the problem of retrieval
with nominal phrases is still unsolved.

the norwegian dewey committee was established by the state library service and
the national library office to advise on dewey classification in norway. its
new geographical tables (suggestions, not instructions), aim to help, for
instance, libraries with large local collections. basically they follow ddc
19, dividing norway into 4 main sections (as against the earlier arnesen
division into 3) with further divisions by county, district and local
authority. comments from libraries were invited: 1 suggestion that arnesen
notation should be retained for north norway has been accepted for future us
editions. a new edition of arnesen (the current norwegian version of dewey,
based on ddc 17) is being undertaken by the norwegian library association.
there will be major changes in the 300 classes, corresponding to ddc 19.
supplementary tables, notes and indexes will be improved, and libraries will
be able to classify broadly or more precisely as required.

subject heading list should be carried out and to provide financial
justification for the work. the list would serve all types of libraries and
would be more flexible than a classification. a thesaurus structure would be
best for the purpose. the list should include between 10,000 and 20,000 terms.

points out that on-line information retrieval is 5 to 10 times faster than
manual retrieval. lists the disadvantages of on-line information systems: the
building of data bases is a complex task; duplication of information is
unavoidable; the costs are high and staff must be trained to use these
systems. in addition, staff must learn a number of 'command languages' because
of the large number of on-line systems available. this problem could perhaps
be overcome by using 'transparent systems' which function as an interface, or
'a translator', between the searcher and the machine. in this case the
searcher would only need one command language.

the impact on small academic libraries of searching periodical indexes on-line

not appear to offer such advantages and learning to operate a terminal can
seem to be alien. describes the introduction of on-line search facilities at

the emergence of on-line data bases represents a shift from providing a
physical entity, a book or an article, to the more abstract concept of
providing or transferring information. the role of the data base
developer/analyst in that shift is that of an information retrieval
'cataloguer' responsible for determining the access points supported by the
data base's contents, much as a traditional library cataloguer defines,
describes, and classifies the intellectual content of a book and 'maps' it
into the library's card catalogue. describing the tasks required in developing

describing phenomena, processing, properties, methods, equipment, names of
chemical reactions, and substructures or families of chemical compounds. a
similar set of 2 vocabularies is used for biology and medicine. the form of
the descriptors and the indexing is similar to that used throughout pascal in

the toxic substances control act subjects some 70,000 chemicals to regulatory
action. however, empirical testing of the biological activities of this number
of compounds is not feasible. an attractive alternative is the development of
predictive methodology which can be used to estimate the potency of an
untested compound toward a specific biological receptor. prerequisite to such
an enterprise is the highly systematic compilation of dose-response
information for a wide range of biological end points and for a wide variety
of molecular species. a format is described for abstracting relevant
information from published studies. the format outlines the test system,
experimental conditions, response analysis, exposure protocol, and results and

plidos is a complete software system for the creation and operation of
miniature data banks with a microcomputer, containing programmes for data
recording, data bank construction and information retrieval. a prototype was
tested at the hanover trades fair in 1980 and the test revealed a need for a
system of this type. the manufacturers plan to offer also a plidos data bank
service from 1981. plidos cannot compete with expensive data processing
systems for large computers but it does offer users a chance to operate their
own information and documentation system without running costs for computing
time or data transmission. the category scheme is flexible enough to satisfy
users' specific requirements. the search logic includes functions and and or

more than 100 current bibliographies are being published at the present time

bibliographies have failed from lack of financial support. in the field of
bibliographical control the most important development has been the
introduction of the computer enabling complex searches to be made rapidly on
very large data bases. major reasons for producing a current bibliography
include the wish to keep abreast of material published in or about an
individual country or region and the desire to make scattered references on a
particular subject more readily available. in future the emphasis in

(the 1980 miles conrad memorial lecture, presented at the 22nd nfais

a change of roles and interrelationships. explores this theme for each of the
groups, and contends that the economy will be healthier in the 80s, with
better and cheaper information products and services if we can find ways to
take full advantage of the diversity, know-how, creativity and financial
resources of the private sector without impacting adversely on services, such
as public libraries, that will continue to require the financial support of

the annual bibliography of norwegian government publications (25th issue 1980)
is surprisingly little-known to libraries and public institutions, considering
the shortage of bibliographical aids to public documents. its scope has varied
over the years; recently it has covered institutions listed in the norwegian
government yearbook. it covers certain publications not in the norwegian
national bibliography. entries are by institution, with dewey numbers and
simplified bibliographic descriptions. part i (books, articles, annual reports
and brochures; about 2300 entries annually) has name and classified indexes,
while part ii (circulars; about 1500 entries) has appeared separately since
1975. 1200 copies are printed, of which 600 go to subscribers and some 75 to

libraries deserve serious study as factors in human culture. they are a
country's most valuable asset. librarianship should become a university
subject as it evolves the best methods of disseminating knowledge.
librarianship needs to study the work of people's and public libraries,
library history, statistics, book conservation, library buildings and staff
training. libraries must help all those turning to them as a school. however,
untrained staff will hamper this. the people's wages created libraries, use of

that: (1) 'library activities' and not 'library types' should be used as the
basis for scientific typisation of libraries; (2) a number of library science
disciplines have developed within the framework of library science which are
based on various differentiation and integration principles; (3) theories of
special librarianship must be built on an analysis of the activities
undertaken by special libraries and not on the 'types' of special libraries;
(4) general library science represents the nucleus essential for further
development of library science knowledge.

citatel' and its czech counterpart ctenar now cater for libraries in general.
although originally designed with public libraries in mind. other periodicals
are more specialised, dealing with the problems of scientific, technical and
economic libraries and information centres in industry; in university, college
and school libraries and libraries in the national health service
establishments. their editorial staff make every effort to impart information
to their readers, not only on library routines and techniques, but also some
insight into the readers psychology, the situation in a similar field abroad,
the latest publications, important events of public interest and the like. a
special newsletter takes up construction of library buildings , their
furnishing and equipment, book collections and cataloguing. although slovak
trade unions as well as museum and agricultural libraries still lack
periodicals of their own, the choice is wide and no librarian and/or
information scientist need be behind the times.

contribution to a section devoted to india. the 10 most reliable indian
library science journals published in english were selected and their contents
from 1974-76 analysed and appraised. 499 articles met the selection criteria:
92% were considered to be descriptive only, and the remainder were judged to
be research articles. 90 articles were concerned with information science, 82
with the organisation of library materials, and 45 with library education and
research. the volume of library science literature in english and published in
india ranks only after that published in the usa and uk.

the eve of the 30th anniversary, the main points of the periodical's history
are outlined. it was founded with the main purpose of assisting staff in
public libraries. with time, its impact has spread to all types of libraries,
in particular in slovakia. librarians have been informed of new, inventive
ideas, both from home and abroad. theory and practice of librarianship in the
soviet union has always attracted special attention. although the educational
role of citatel' has been emphasised as the most important one, there has
always been enough space on its pages to advise librarians of improvement in
working conditions, and to campaign for the establishment of new libraries.
today, citatel' is well established not only in czechoslovakia, but it also
has a good reputation abroad, and interest in it is on the increase.

librarians fail to attract the right people to their ranks; they are neither
inventive nor innovative, there is too little in librarianship to justify even
a first degree; only librarians themselves would consider their occupation to
be a profession; and fellowship should be reserved for award on an honorary
basis (and then only rarely). librarianship should recognise its modest place
in society, recruit those with a natural flair for organisation, and organise
itself along businesslike lines to provide a service the nature of which does
not need explicating except to those more interested in abstract philosophy
than practical utility. librarianship is much more interested in rhetoric than
logic.

the metrical characteristics of information space are compared with those of
physical space. an abstract model is used to show that information space is
like that of landscapes and skyscrapers. as individuals we learn very early to
correct the distortions that subjective appearances impose on us but traces of
this process are shown by cosmological history. these arguments are supported
by other evidence indicating that information quantities should be measured
logarithmically. for parts 1 and 2 see 81/1828 and 81/1829. for part 4 see the

argues that public libraries should employ specialised personnel to expand
library involvement in the cultural, social and economic development of the
community. before 1960, librarians and libraries provided only limited
services to a minority of users; with the availability of new technology and
specialised training, the librarian must meet the challenge of responding to
the information and documentation needs of all citizens, and combat the
competition books face from other means of communication. outlines recent
developments in libraries and the profession, and presents a view of the
library in the coming decades as an agent in the promotion of reading, the
dissemination of information, and socio-cultural change.

in public libraries in nrw for a population of 17 million. this does not
compare well with figures of 5, 6 or even 8-10 books per head of population in
other european countries. the target for public libraries in nrw is 2 books
per head but even this figure will be difficult to achieve in the face of
rising book costs and a static acquisition budget. although there are several

volunteers were formed, often with the support of the local church
authorities. following the formation in 1917 of the vereniging voor openbaar
leeszaalwezen in friesland (association of public reading rooms in friesland)
a regular delivery of book boxes was organised by the town libraries for the

the physically and mentally handicapped, contribute roughly 6% of
czechoslovakia's population. to this end, the national conference at poprad,
(slovakia), held in may 81 dealt with the improvement of library services for
handicapped people. the lectures given showed a good theoretical foundation
very often more advanced than the practical assistance given to the
handicapped and disabled. librarians can influence the general public's
attitude to their handicapped fellow-citizens. the conference participants
made some useful suggestions, for example, adjustment of library equipment for
the handicapped, development of reading aids for bedridden people and the
like, and there was also an appeal to the press for full coverage of these and
many other problems facing the handicapped in this, the international year of
the disabled.

.I 568

the handicapped are dependent on the general public for spreading knowledge of
available aids and the role of libraries. society creates the handicap by
making activities unavailable. it is therefore the responsibility of society
and individuals to see that obstacles are removed not just to better living
conditions, but also to a full cultural life for the handicapped. the demand
for information on material for the handicapped available in libraries was
shown in a campaign led by kalmar regional library to be growing among
teachers trying to integrate the handicapped in schools. staff within the
social institutions can also act as links between the handicapped and the
library. the regional library must stimulate local libraries to initiate
domiciliary services and establish systems for lending of speaking books and
personal contacts with users. the mass media and special teachers are other
means of reaching the handicapped with information about library servi ces.

6 years after the government agreed on a new cultural policy, no proposals for
such a policy on the needs of the handicapped exist. despite our concern for
freedom of expression, many handicapped are denied access to the spoken and
printed word. libraries have an obligation to make their cultural activities
available to all. direct physical accessibility means that the handicapped can
reach the library, enter it and stay there. but improved buildings and
transport cannot replace the domiciliary library service. indirect
accessibility means that library activities and media must be adapted to reach
new groups. 'easy readers' are an example of such a medium and their
publication and distribution through libraries are discussed. the new state
library for speech and braille printing is the 1st stage in provision for the
blind and partially-sighted; the next is the increased distribution of such
material to other groups.

reports on a unesco project concerned with the visually handicapped in
malaysia to review present services, set up a model for a service at the
national library, kuala lumpur, recommend improvements to present services and
organise a seminar. only 8,000 of an estimated 40,000 blind in west malaysia
are registered as there is no obligation to do so. the national library hopes
to have a section for the visually handicapped when its new building is ready
in 1983, but some large print books are available already. malaysia has 4
societies for the blind. the malayan association in kaula lumpur produces and
lends braille books to registered users. talking books are produced by st.
nicholas school for the blind in penang. most material is in english, but it
is hoped to increase the production of books in malay at the expense of
english, as the latter material can be borrowed from abroad.

the library for talking books and braille (tpb) was established on 1 jan 80
when the state took over the library activities of the society for the blind.
the 1st library for the blind had begun in 1892, and with the arrival of tapes
the society began lending talking books in 1955, now as cassettes the dominant
medium. from the start the books were available in the public libraries. the
books are sold at cost price by the library service to the public libraries.
the provision was the subject of several reports, above all the handicap
commission's report culture for all, 1976. direct loans to individuals from
tpb are falling, and the library's role as centre for loans of deposit
collections is growing. the library, which is led by 7 state appointees, has
units for production, lending, educational material, development and
information.

the 'information education' of school children is not just the responsibility
of librarians, but it should be an integral part of the modern teaching
process in every subject. school libraries have traditionally operated on a
rudimentary level as bookstocks with lending outlets-mostly supplying
literature relevant to the teaching of the mother tongue. this is no longer
adequate and school libraries must be transformed into up-to-date information
and study centres. the slovak ministry of education has issued a directive no
3767/1979 which envisages school libraries fulfilling 3 roles' supplying
library and information material to both teachers and pupils; contributing to
the upbringing of the new socialist generation through working with books;
educating both teachers and pupils to use information sources independently
during individual study, career selection and leisure. acquisition must place
greater emphasis on scientific, te chnical and other subject oriented books.

furnish the data needed; (4) impact of mass media, and television in

the objective of the study was to test the following hierarchical model'
public library use is a function of (1) individual characteristics; (2)
awareness of library services; (3) perceived accessibility of the library; (4)
perceived ease of use of the library; and (5) use of other non-public
libraries. the model was tested with 4 different library use measures-a
dichotomised measure of use and nonuse, and, among library users, frequency of
use and 2-factor analytically derived indexes descriptive of 2 distinctly
different types of library use. type 1 use appeared to measure use intensity;
type 2-in-house use. interview data were collected from 202 residents of
syracuse, new york. results indicated that public library users perceived the
library as more accessible than did nonusers, and use frequency was related to
awareness of special library programmes, as was intensity of use, and in-house
use was related  to use of other libraries.

the main concern of libraries and information centres should be speedy and
effective service to users. they must be concerned to eliminate any
unnecessary delays, which may cause delays in the scientist's work. librarians
should take an active interest in the work of their users and their education
and professional expertise should allow them to do so. a survey in the slovak
academy of science had shown that most sought after are information sources
1-3 years old in natural sciences and medicine, 1-10 years old in the social
sciences. good acquisition policy, quality in bibliographical and information
services contribute to further development and scientific and technological
revolution.

a user survey was conducted at the hugh stephens college library to determine
the degree of user satisfaction and identify limiting factors. analysis of
data from 203 data sheets completed by patrons requesting specific titles
reveals that acquisitions by the library and user error are more significant
limiting factors in this library than either circulation or library error. it
is recommended that further study be made of the extent of use of the holdings
of other libraries, and of the proportion of users who come to browse or
search by subject rather than specific title, before changing acquisitions
policy. a significant proportion of user error indicates a lack of adequate
library searching techniques, and it is suggested that assistance be provided
for potential users through such means as library orientation programmes and
signs alerting them to commonly committed errors of the location of special
collections. report not availabl e from ntis.

argues that direct librarian-user interaction is long overdue for close
scrutiny, since this relationship may not be in harmony with the overall
standard of other subsystems of the information centre. points out that, apart
from qualifications and experience, a librarian must also possess a
personality which is psychologically well balanced and adaptable, since a
great deal of his/her work involves exposure to potentially stressful
situations. these situations arise with users who are poorly informed about
the practical difficulties associated with obtaining a particular information
source and who are not able to appreciate that other readers have their
pressing requirements as well. name tags for librarians should lead to greater
personal responsibility. in large libraries direct user contact involves shift
working for the predominantly female staff; this leads to difficulties and
sometimes less than adequate personnel are exposed to the pu blic. this area
of library services cries out for a systematic overhaul.

argues that uk libraries and the british broadcasting corporation continuing
education have the same staple customer group. as provision of local authority
adult education classes drops and budget cuts bite deep everywhere, it would
benefit both organisations to cooperate and maintain a 'high profile'. for
their part, libraries should present themselves as providers and partners in
adult education rather than as servicing agents; aggressively market materials
associated with continuing education series; and use their closeness to the
community to attract and serve the working class. with its 4,500 outlets, the
uk library system is a sleeping community education giant-the giant must
awake.

report on a study by a sussex junior-school librarian of the library's policy
of book provision. a questionnaire was presented to 90 children in a local
middle school on their reading interests. this pilot study enabled the
librarian to alter the research design, notably by prompting increased pupil
participation and an improved questionnaire. 258 children in the author's own
school took a standardised comprehension test and completed the new
questionnaire. a panel of children catalogued the school's 4,793 books under 2
main classifications-fiction and information, and sorted them into 50
categories. discussions and decisions were taped. 1 in 20 books were assessed
for their readability levels. a comparison of reading ages and readability
levels of the books showed extensive mismatching of literature to pupils.

many librarians are familiar with bradford's law of scattering as a

so as to reveal their underlying similarity. it is noted that all of these
laws are in essence mathematically identical. reviews several attempts that
have been made to derive this common regularity from more basic principles,

for enlarging images may be 'passive' aids which only enlarge, such as
binoculars, lenses and magnifying glasses, or 'active', such as magnivision.
the latter is a closed circuit tv system by means of which the user can
enlarge the text and improve the image in various ways. systems which enable
reading by means other than seeing include braille; talking books on tape;
optacon, a machine which transfers letters to vibrating points; the kurzweil

sense, enthusiasm, and a love of the medium; a national map collection need
not be held by a national library; map libraries and archives can form
advantageous links; there should be a specific map classification code; a map
library's activities should take into account collection size and user
numbers; and although different opinions in the profession are valuable, it is

collection. broadly categorises 5 types of library (historical research,
special, public, school and academic), commenting about the state of the art
of photograph collection within each, and discussing their current awareness,
special selection problems, and areas of anticipation of potential usability
of a popular photograph archive.

universities as they now exist. the study assembles librarians' opinions of
these collections about what an ideal academic collection should be, and
collects experts' opinions of what would be optimum standards of operation
with emphasis on the selection of such collections, thus moving towards the

citations appearing in the pages of a single journal, journal of educational
psychology, were counted for the years 1960-1979. the results were compared
with those found by using networks of journals and with the number of
abstracts published by psychological abstracts during the same period. in both
cases the results tend to show that the relationship between citation habits
and the volume of literature available for citing is not very close.

the swiss social science archive collects all swiss material and much from
abroad on social problems and social science. stocks include 80,000 books,
600,000 newspaper cuttings and a pamphlet collection of 500,000 items. the
archive has a keyword index of 350 terms; udc was used until 1959, when the
archive invented its own decimal classification to provide more specialised
coverage. it is sometimes hard to obtain the necessary non-commercial material
but the archive receives many gifts of private collections. the archive has 12
staff and an annual budget of 900,000 fr, including contributions from the
town and canton of zurich and from the federal government. swiss social
science documentation has an important centre here and is being improved
through the archive's work with other documentation centres.

movements have been a part of us history since the colonial period, the
federal government has tended to leave them alone. there are relatively few

the world nations can be classified, in terms of scientific productivity, into
3 groups-advanced, middle-level and peripheral. scientific journals in turn
are of 2 kinds: national, regional or local; and international. most journals
published in middle-level countries are local journals. considers 95 english
language journals published in australia, canada, india and israel, indexed in
science citation index. a citation analysis follows. amongst the findings were
that most of the journals cite more than they are cited, local journals cite a
greater proportion of older references than international journals, and of the
4 countries considered, canada and australia fare better than india.

at the end of mar 79 the 79/80 rapid statistics concerning public libraries in
west germany were published. they are published annually by the german library
institute but from 1982 the 'deutsche bibliotheksstatistik dbs' will be
publishing a complete set of statistics. the section concerning public music
libraries in the current statistics shows that there are 54 of them and that 2
more are planned. the statistics concerning stock are difficult to evaluate as
some libraries now have new methods of calculating stock or others have their
stock included in central libraries. however, taking this into consideration
there has been an increase in stock of about 2.9% and the rate of borrowing
has risen by 6.4%. of the 40 libraries which supplied figures concerning
expenditure 1/3 had no rise in their budget or even had cuts of between -7%
and -24%. although the remaining 2/3 had a budget rise the total drop in
expenditure was 2.1%.

lecture given at the annual conference of the association of librarians in
public libraries, berlin 1980. the euphoria from library planning in the 1970s
has now faded, leaving behind scepticism as to whether the plans can be
carried out. library planning without a legal basis is not binding; the law
should provide a legal framework, local authority planning the detailed
description of concrete aims. planning stages are described with reference to
the frankfurt-am-main library development plan of 1972. library planning is
particularly important in times of financial difficulty; a local authority's
financial capacity must be considered in order to avoid cost inflation.
library plans can be regarded as pacemakers on the way to a better development
of library services.

planning of library services is a complex task the successful completion of
which requires collection and evaluation of a large number of data. discusses
how these data are collected and evaluated by the libraries of higher

library services requirements of these establishments. the data were collected
from detailed questionnaires sent out to 165 heads of libraries and to 373
members of library staff. describes the planning methods used by the library
of the siberian metallurgical institute. suggests that the planning of library
services provided by an academic establishment can be effective only if all
social processes taking place at the establishment are thoroughly analysed.

the (uk) national health service is to be reorganised in 1982 for the third
time since the war. the 1974 concept of the health care district as a health
care community is to be the starting point of the next reorganisation and many
multi-district areas are to be split, amalgamated or regrouped. librarians
have developed library services of the nhs as an information network, and much
of the country is now covered by regional networks incorporating nhs and
medical school libraries. the new district health authorities may disrupt or
cut services altogether, nhs fails frequently to recognise the direct
contribution of library services to quality health care, and some libraries
could come under the administrators of individual hospitals, although both the
library association and nhs regional librarians group advocate organisation on
a district rather than an institutional basis. librarians must be seen to be
contributing to health care and actively campaign for recognition within the
nhs.

prospects and further development of the major library networks in slovakia
are briefly outlined for the next 5 years. although the past decade proved to
be the most successful period in public libraries, a new scheme for a public
library network is envisaged including several district cultural centres as
well as the necessary structural changes. in-service courses for information
scientists must be offered on a larger scale than before and the cooperation
of scientific libraries with their counterparts in socialist countries should
be strengthened. young people should be helped by school libraries which ought
to be fully integrated into the whole educational process starting at primary
schools. manual workers, labourers and young apprentices can be attracted to
trade union libraries by a great variety of library games, quizes and
competitions. information workers are encouraged to play a more active role in
the comecon information system a s well as contributing to the international
dinform.

the standard of library public relations work in west germany is often
considered to be lower than that in other countries. increasing financial
problems in local government will soon make the libraries' task of keeping up
with media industry trends more difficult. if public libraries still wish to
be regarded as the institutions responsible for contemporary work with
cultural media, they must provide better publicity. each library has
individual features which can provide a focal point in public relations.
librarians must establish good relationships with other local cultural
organisations, who will then support cultural activities in the library,
resulting in less expenditure for the librarian. the librarian should be a
'cultural agent provocateur', organising cultural activities not only to
increase loans but also to improve library service quality.

as long as there are no library laws guaranteeing financial provision, public
libraries will be counted among the 'voluntary' responsibilities of local
government, which are particularly affected in times of recession. library
planning is described within the context of general municipal administration,
including the importance of establishing priorities and of library cooperation
with other local government departments, especially those concerned with
organisation, personnel and finance. many important problems must be solved
before new projects can be carried out and possible alternatives must be
tested.

local authorities are legally bound to provide library services. the widest
possible area should be covered by a library network, involving cooperation
not only with other local authorities but also with other library
administrators, e.g. the churches and industry. libraries are also important
as community meeting-places and as educational and cultural centres. in many
areas minimum standards of library provision have not yet been attained. some
people call for state legislation to improve the library service but this
would cause too many complications. cultural administration should be
distinguished by its autonomy and freedom from compulsion by the state.

centralisation is practically complete in rsfsr (russian soviet federate of
socialist republic). in 1980, 2,200 centralised library systems, (cls),
operated in russia, uniting 50,000 libraries. but problems of acquisitions and
stock-exploitation hamper cls. many central libraries complain of a
deterioration of acquisitions, especially of fiction and children's
literature. book-ordering departments do not fulfil cls orders, but dump
unwanted books on them. relations between booksellers and libraries need
overhauling. booksellers should be rewarded for fulfilling libraries' book
orders. increased fines may prevent loss of books. cls need binding equipment
for book repairs and should improve book use by intra-system book-exchange,
thus improving service to rural libraries. librarians need higher specialised
education to equip them for reading-guidance.

centralisation has freed librarians from many routine tasks, making their work
more creative. libraries' transformation into social and leisure centres has
compelled librarians to extend the subject range of work with the public.
centralisation's problems include' unsatisfied book requests; utilisation of
unified bookstock; need for library mechanisation and for staff with
specialised library education; interlibrary loans. the booktrade has shirked
responsibility for building up library stocks; 85% of library fiction and 90%
of children's literature requirements remain unfulfilled. the 11th 5-year-plan
must involve' (1) intensifying library development and increased
effectiveness; (2) maximum satisfaction of book-requests; (3) enhancing
libraries' social role; (4) training library staff for a creative
work-relationship; (5) learned libraries' and booksellers' participation to

a goal of libraries is to assure the improvement of library services. many use
standards as a method of assuring the quality of services, but standards have
often failed through a lack of individual commitment to those standards and to
the methodology used in establishing them. many segments of the health care
field have adopted the concept of quality assurance and are applying it to the
service and care they provide. the process has the potential to raise or
assure quality of service. it involves' selection of a subject for review;
developing measurable criteria; ratifying the criteria; evaluating existing
services using the criteria; identifying and analysing problems; developing
and implementing solutions; and reevaluating services. 2 pilot quality
assurance studies conducted in the midwest health science library network in
june 78 are described. plans are underway to use this process on a regional
basis.

text of a discussion with councillors involved in the provision of public
library services in 3 local authorities in the netherlands. the councillor
from rijswijk, where charges for public library membership were abolished on 1
jan 74, pointed out that the number of registered borrowers had risen from
12,907 in 1973 to 21,183 in 1974. however, the growth in membership figures
had led to increased pressure on the existing services with the result that it
had become necessary to reduce library opening hours from 47 1/2 hours to 29
1/2 hours per week. the uithoorn and heerhugowaard councillors defended the
policy of their local councils in maintaining charges on the grounds that they
were not excessive.

system is reported. employing a deliberate sequence of significance tests
within the context of an interrupted time-series, quasi-experimental design to
study the impact of the programme on service demand, the results are evaluated

an examination of the science of the study of human beings in their working
environment, in particular health, legal rights, and social ethics. the
relevance to librarianship is demonstrated by 3 problems' continuous activity

units; and working in conditions where temperature, humidity, ventilation, and
dust control are inadequate.

argues that, as a generalisation, librarians who regard themselves as acting
within an educational environment behave rather differently from those who
stress their librarianship functions and that these differences are related to
academic status. the award of academic status encourages the former by
attracting and retaining those willing to adopt an extended educational role.
academic rank also elicits the internalisation, or self-ascription, by the
librarian of educational roles.

volunteers in public libraries cannot keep pace with the constant increasing
demands from the readers. thus the number of public libraries professionally
staffed is steadily rising and at present is 4 times higher compared to 1957
and the number of qualified librarians is nearly 9 times higher. during the
past 14 years the readership in libraries run by volunteers increased by 7.5%
while in those run by qualified staff it increased by 163%. the number of
loans in libraries staffed by part-time workers increase twice while in
libraries with qualified staff it increased 4 times. these are only 2 examples
of how qualified staff contributed to the effectiveness of the library and
information services. however, for the time being, the volunteers will be
maintained due to the present situation.

in eastern slovakia from a total of more than 1,100 public libraries, about
950 are staffed by part-time librarians. they work on a voluntary basis mainly
in the villages. on average 50% are teachers from local schools. in spite of
their dedication and hard work, the volunteers often lacked the necessary
knowledge of librarianship and information science. for that reason,
regulations, issued by the slovak ministry of culture in 1976, imposed the
duty on district libraries to make provisions for in-service training of the
said librarians, ranging from 8 to 24 hours per year. so far, the syllabuses
of such short courses as well as teaching methods have varied considerably. in
addition to the traditional lectures, discussions and role playing, for
instance, are to be used more widely. more profound knowledge of both slovak
and foreign literature (belles-lettres, fiction) and also a greater insight
into the psychology of adults will no doubt,  exercise favourable influence on
the librarian's performance, which, in turn, will result in expansion of the
local library and its services.

public libraries attract subscribers who use the library in both legitimate

changing security functioning and goals and a few minor structural changes

indicates that there is no certain formula for the optimisation of library

effect can be uniform, monotonous, cold and rather soulless. discusses the
pros and cons of using daylight and artificial lighting, as well as the
biological needs for daylight. proposes a new concept of lighting design,
based on visual tasks and biological needs, which should be entered in the
building programme, to enable the architect to employ the best lighting for
visual tasks, the internal appearance of the library and the well-being of its

there is quite a lot of information and referral activity for the handicapped

contemporary people are inner-directed and deserve access to an unrestricted

spectrum of materials so that the public will perceive the library as a

agreement was reached at the un conference on science and technology for

however, due to the lack of interest on the part of the industrialised

agreement. even if it were established, it would do little to fulfil the real
science information needs of the third world. a better alternative for
developing countries would be to share locally produced science and technology
information amongst themselves and develop twin (a third world information
network) to meet their specific needs and requirements. there are indications

discussion about or application of new technology is hindered by people's
attitudes to it, ranging from the over-enthusiastic to the profoundly
suspicious. men seem to have been replaced by computers, so the human factor
in technology is neglected. data bases must, however, be oriented towards
man's needs, and dialogue systems are meant for machines and men; human
intermediaries between machines and users will be needed for a long time. all
scientists search their own stock of information before using other sources;
at present there is no connection between or analysis of these small, informal
stocks. connection of large retrieval systems with individual information
systems would show respect for the human components. the informal human
exchange of opinion and the human brain's ability to create cross-connections
in information are still essential.

the yaroslavl regional children's library is successfully organising
library/bibliography classes for 1st to 8th formers, including a quarterly
bibliography day, aiming to interest school children in books. bibliography
day includes songs about famous literary heroes, questions to answer from
encyclopaedias, etc. playing while learning proved possible, even necessary.
but the region has only partially adopted the syllabus' 'foundations of
library/bibliographic knowledge'. in 1979 the government paper on improving
the rsfr (russian soviet federal republic) children's library service stressed
the need for studies according to a given syllabus. but 275 out of 365 schools
in chuvashiya and 90% of moscow schools avoid this work. bibliographic
literacy is of national importance. responsibility rests with libraries and

questioning of social scientists and pure scientists/technologists revealed
that the principal alerting agent for the former is the library, and for the
latter, the selective dissemination of promotional materials and books by
publishers and booksellers. analysis of 1st use versus age revealed that a
book's interest potential depends upon several parameters' (1) user community
(scientific field); (2) actuality; and (3) obsolescence' the rate of decay is

the printed version of the finnish periodicals index covers 1957-77. in
addition there is a retrospective index for 1803-63. the current index is now
processed by a computer. the index is selective both in its coverage of
periodicals and periodical articles. udc has been used since computerisation.
because of computerisation the presentation has suffered. there are plans to

cowocor has been developed since 1968 to rationalise documentation of chemical
literature and improve its technical and economic content. information and
documentation are carried out in 1 process by means of modern text processing
machinery. the process is described in detail; abstracts are recorded on
magnetic tapes, whose texts are used as printer's copy for a fortnightly
abstracting journal. 150,000 abstracts are stored at present. the tapes are
the basis of input, coding and retrieval. the cowocor thesaurus contains
75,000 terms including synonyms. the classification is basically
monohierarchic with additional polydimensions; the treatment of synonyms,
composite terms and homographs is discussed.

the canadian periodical index (cpi) began as an indexing service at the
windsor public library where, from 1924-32 mimeographed periodical indexes
were produced. today it is organised by the canadian library association,
which assumed responsibility for it in 1946. every 3 years cla establishes new
rates by means of a subscription rate survey. a questionnaire is sent to all
subscribers, listing periodicals covered by cpi, and asking subscribers to
list which of these are included in the institution's holdings. cost-per-entry
is then established, and total entries for a year in cpi are calculated.
taking costs of salaries, automation, publishing and rent, cpi's budget is
established. discusses the survey in detail and other considerations which
arise from it.

a measure of library performance is the probability that the patron can find
the material sought. this parameter, document availability, is best measured
by sampling the expressed demand. sampling the shelf-list is far less
intrusive, but fails to provide data on collection adequacy, user catalogue
and shelf skills, and factors inhibiting availability (such as circulation).
describes a simple technique for adjusting shelf-list data to reflect
expressed demand results and presents a worked example, explaining the steps
involved.

the new law came into effect at the beginning of 1981. a local authority has
to set up a committee for cultural activities. out of 84 towns only 9 had such
a committee at the beginning of this year. all other types of local
authorities, 150 of them, did not have one. the duties of the committees are
the oversight and instigation of cultural activities, cooperation between
different types of activities publicity, provision of accommodation, and
budget. from 1982 state grants will be available for staff and organisation
costs. the new law should ease the work of libraries and librarians who until
now have been responsible for the organisation of many of the local cultural
activities.

everyone who wishes should be able to obtain musical recordings of interest to
them and related reference material. but some readers need qualified
specialist help. most people visit the music library hoping to find some sort
of club. librarians must estimate which resources would achieve the music
library's aims. a large record library and good technical equipment are
essential. series of slides accompanying the music create a better artistic
and historic atmosphere. the librarian should observe all new events in the
musical world, maintaining close contact with his audience's interests and
developing individual and group activities to make the music section a centre
of attraction.

there are 2 ways to achieve system compatibility' develop or acquire an
integrated system, or make the best of what you have to tie your current
systems together. compatible systems can treat library data as an
organisational resource, reduce data duplication, improve management
information, reduce the overhead required for separate systems operations, and
make conversion to future technology more feasible. planning for computer
systems compatibility must be coordinated by the central administration of the
library, who can referee departmental conflicts.

a paper presented at a 1979 quebec corporation des bibliothecaires
professionnels conference, considering how librarians should approach the
introduction of new technology. the necessity of planning is illustrated by
examples of various canadian university projects, and the sophisticated
management procedures of today compared with the early experimental phase in
the 1960s. planning involves consideration of costs, benefits and operational
satisfaction in the preliminary phase, while implementation chiefly involves
management of human relations, and the adoption of a systematic approach to
change which takes account of the wider implications of altering current
practices. librarians attitudes to automation vary, but the essential goal is
improvement of existing techniques, not innovation for its own sake, with the
emphasis on economic management, efficient service provision, and harmonious
user relations.

a completely integrated computerised library and information system is
described, suitable for an academic library or information system requiring
complete and speedy literature and information provision for teaching and
research units, quick and efficient loan systems and possibilities for using
the services of other academic libraries. work is divided between a main
computer with centralised functions, assisted by smaller computers connected
on-line and used for local functions; cooperation of 2 libraries via the main
computer, individual components and administration questions are discussed.
the components can produce loan automation for open and closed access stock,
cataloguing and literature searching. the concept is being achieved through
the automation of saarland university, saarbrucken library; software already

contribution to a section devoted to planning interlending systems for
developing countries. in zambia, acquisitions are centralised, which can lead
to unsuitable selection for local libraries. the national library receives
most funds, while other libraries suffer, and there are few good bookshops.
interlending is focused on the national university library, and attempts to
create a national union catalogue have failed so far. demand for books is
high, but librarians' status is low. interlending could be based on existing
research collections, but a central collection of journals would be costly and
premature.

contribution to a section devoted to planning interlending systems for
developing countries. interlending in barbados is assisted by the close
proximity of the major libraries, which have good telephone links.
international requests are routed via the university of west indies library to
the blld for journals, but to a wider selection of libraries for monographs.
the choice is difficult and time-consuming for monograph requests, and
automated union catalogues produced in other countries could help in this
respect. small collections of periodicals satisfy a high proportion of demand,
but actual titles remain to be identified.

an assessment is needed of factors contributing to the cost of obtaining
material on interlibrary loan. the main internal library resource involved is
staff time, which must be used effectively and efficiently. discusses costs
per loan, charges for service, and document delivery. concludes that libraries
should be able to operate a cost-effective interlending service by
concentrating on items which users really need and by assessing carefully when
interloans are most beneficial. at the same time, it is necessary to assess
the effects of new procedures and technologies at local level on the scholarly

pennsylvania. the planning process comprises 3 aspects' (1) the preservation
and restoration of pre-1840 valuable 'rare books'; (2) microfilming of
brittle, acidic pre-1840 works; and (3) the maintenance of today's books, with
a life expectancy of 30-50 years, for future generations.

describes research conducted by whitman products, ltd., rhode island, into
alternate approaches to cover materials for class 'a' library binding (which
is endorsed by the us library binding institute). class 'a' cover materials
have previously been limited to group f buckram, but many non-woven substrates
are available, including cellulose fibres reinforced with a synthetic resin in
latex form. these have, however, been deficient in the book's spine area.
whitman has worked with a type ii grade non-woven base with spine
reinforcement using polyester scrims. it is felt that the new approach offers
sufficient advantages to justify an effort by binderies and others to develop
the equipment and techniques to make this a viable, profitable class 'a'
library binding adhesive.

the commonest reasons for book losses from public libraries are theft,
non-return of books, and losses whilst on loan to readers. thefts may be
prevented by such measures as closed access systems, better reader
supervision, security devices and library user education; non-return may be
combatted by better membership registration and issue procedures, revision of
fines, or legal action; and losses by borrowers are outside the effective
control of the librarian.

information thought necessary for assessing the potential impact of a limited
journal circulation policy at the university of california, san francisco,
included the effects on seating, on in-house photocopying, and on circulation.
an initial one-week survey showed journal circulation to be 7% of the total,
with journals issued during the past 5 years comprising 45% of the total. a
survey of user photocopying practice suggested that circulation limited to
journals over 5 years old might result in a 90% increase in photocopying, and
circulation survey were used to predict a 45% decrease in circulation. results
of implementing a limited circulation policy were a 41% circulation decrease
and a 136% increase in photocopying. differences between prediction and
results may be accounted for by the effect of duplicate copy subscriptions and
by provision of convenient photocopy facilities.

an automated circulation system should not be developed without due regard to
an existing automated cataloguing system. above all, there should be the
facility for data exchange, to produce machine-readable book labels, and to
establish the necessary files without duplication of data. there are problems,
however, as catalogue and lending are based upon title-entry and book as
physical unit respectively, and further, the complex structure of title-entry
and call number. various functions of the system make it necessary to connect
different book units according to title entry. a short title is necessary for
overdue notices. discusses problems resulting from cataloguing with an
off-line system, whilst using an on-line circulation system.

large libraries are always trying to reduce the size of their catalogues and,
at the same time, to simplify the retrieval of individual indexed items. the
bulk of library stock must be indexed individually, however, there is a
certain type of literature, such as information leaflets, promotional
literature, which is suitable for group processing (1 catalogue card is used
for a series of items for example). the main library of leningrad polytechnic
prepared 'instructions for group processing of information literature' in
1977. the implementation of these instructions is discussed. it is shown that
group processing of certain types of literature can considerably increase the
effectiveness of cataloguing, decrease labour consumption and reduce the size
of library catalogues.

data base by a unique, locally written computer program which allows great
flexibility in records manipulation. local control of catalogue production
permits expansion of the program format by the creation of local tags and
linkage to related monograph records in the card catalogue, while providing a

within the scope of the subject access project (sap), at lund university
library, sweden, a new version of on-line catalogue for monographs has been
developed. using the sap-indexing method, existing bibliographic catalogue
records have been enriched with selected terms from contents tables and book
indexes. the idea of sap is to produce subject descriptions of books taken
from the books themselves and to make more use of a publication's 'inherent'
attributes. it is also an approach to the shortcomings of classification
systems in describing a book's contents by means of a limited number of
classification codes. by sap, low cost retrieval capabilities are provided for
monograph users.

authority file for nigerian names, posed by the incidence of personal names,
honorifics, the combination of a personal name with a family or place name,
and appellations attached to the name mohammed. librarians must cooperate with
publishers and the authors themselves to find solutions to the problem. one
such solution may be the capitalisation of the entry part of the name on the
title page of a work, which would greatly assist all national and
international users of nigeria's catalogues and national bibliographies.

alphabetische katalogisierung-rules for alphabetical cataloguing) is almost
complete. it will be known as rak-musik. work has been carried out since 1971
by a committee attached to the german library institute's commission for
alphabetical cataloguing. terms used in rak were replaced with similar ones
from the world of music as far as possible. during the preparation period
several publications appeared which were used in compiling the rules. the isbd
(international standard bibliographic description) for non-book material was
published in parts between 1977-79. although the section on sound recordings
was not detailed enough, the isbd (printed music) was so complex that only
some parts were selected for inclusion. in future the rak music rules should
provide a basis for music cataloguing.

when based on a single model, a document retrieval system may be coherently
designed, convenient to use, and easy to maintain. the relational model
provides a natural way of viewing document retrieval and has a sound
theoretical foundation. a particular area of interest is indexing. all
indexingtools (including negative dictionaries, stem dictionaries, and
thesauri) are stored as relations and are manipulated using relational
operations. this procedure means that, conceptually, all indexing is done at
search time in a modular and dynamic fashion. describes this modular approach,
gives examples, and summarises the advantages.

.I 864

information retrieval in a relational indexing system has been tested by means
of a suite of computer programs which will carry out searches in a variety of

user judgements of the output. details of the programming are described. some
initial results are discussed with respect to strengths and possible
weaknesses of the system.

the need for a definitive thesaurus of music has been recognised for many
years and various steps have been taken towards a more comprehensive method of
cataloguing musical content. the german library institute (deutsche
bibliotheksinstitut (dbi)) has been working on a thesaurus of music since
1978. 1 of the greatest difficulties in the preparation was deciding which
criteria were necessary for indexing music titles. work started by collecting
material and examining each title to see whether it contained certain concepts
which referred to the content. these formed the empiric base for the thesaurus
vocabulary. the thesaurus will contain 500-600 terms which will be the future
preferred indexing terms. the project is not yet completed but is ready to be
tested by the municipal music library in munich in the framework of their
cataloguing activity.

components, such as linguistic analysis; formation of analysis results into
g-networks; discovery of relevant textual points assisted by 4 relevance
functions; and retrieval dialogue. all components are being tested in the
context of an office information system and a system on work safety; the
system will begin operating during the 1980s.

a massive number of personal collections of papers and reports exist in
medicine and a wide number of other subject areas. the usefulness of these
collections could be improved by providing a link with the large on-line
collections, informing the user which retrieved references were held in his
own collection. this link could be achieved with extra local processing on the
search terminal resulting in improved confidence in on-line systems and
increased utilisation of both remote and personal collections.

a family of models, developed during a 1-year study of the impact of on-line
information services on uk library and information systems, is used to
introduce information system dynamics; a computer-based simulation technique
for exploring the structure and processes of complex social systems. modelling
information system dynamics should improve communication between planners,
librarians, information producers and users and hence result in more effective
information services.

the history of library information provision has undergone 4 phases' (1) stock
formation; (2) automation of library and information processes; (3)
information flow and intensive stock growth; (4) development of electronic
communication. the combination of electronic teletype with video terminals
facilitated information transmission. the telefax equipment transmits a
facsimile of the information along a telephone network. the 'electronic post'
transmits communications from one person to another. systems have evolved for
transmitting information onto domestic tv screens. utilisation of tv channels
facilitated the creation of automated systems providing information to a wide
circle of consumers. closed-circuit tv systems permit libraries to disseminate
information selectively. recently videorecordings, using high information
capacity disk videoplayers, have been introduced into libraries.

contribution to a thematic issue on information services for the disabled.
outlines the implications for the handicapped of developments in
telecommunications such as videotext and the continued growth of large

people fear that the development of increasingly sophisticated electronic
systems for use in the home will further isolate the severely disabled rather
than integrate them into society.

the initial uk viewdata concept was of a system of powerful computers, each
holding all the information supplied by 'information providers'. the west
germans enhanced this concept by connecting their central bildschirmtext
(viewdata) computers to 'third party' (i.e. other people's) data bases. the
dramatic results have made the uk add the german modifications to prestel and
the new service will be available in london in early 1982. describes the
demonstration of this 'gateway' concept at 2 recent uk conferences, the
response, implications, possible further uses of gateways, and the greater use
of viewdata in west germany than in the uk.

an introduction to viewdata systems is provided as a basis for studying their
potential for educational use. the bbc are already conducting experiments to
use ceefax in education and costs are expected to fall as application becomes
more widespread. viewdata systems are considered to be versatile and will
probably be used most in specialised education rather than the more general
field. future enhancements should include microprocessor-controlled terminals
connected in clusters over a single telephone line, improved graphics
facilities, and the linking of small in-house systems to the national prestel
network as more educational institutions acquire their own computers.

revised version of paper presented at a conference, new developments in
canadian communications law and policy, ottawa, jan 80. the provision of
videotex services raises interesting legal issues. the existing framework of
regulations applicable to radio, television, and telecommunications will
likely apply to videotex, although different transmission mechanisms may well
be regulated differently. it is uncertain if the copyright law in canada
covers information stored in computers such as that which would be contained
in a videotex system. videotex services originating outside canada would be
able to sidestep canadian priorities and canadian legislative requirements. it
has been suggested that a way of dealing with the problem would be to regulate
the flow of data across national borders.

british telecom, part of the post office, has demonstrated prototype picture
prestel capable of displaying full-colour photographs, accompanied by text.
this technology is already available to potential overseas purchasers of

'bildschirmtext' (btx) is a viewdata system similar to prestel which is being
developed in west germany by the federal post office. btx registered users
will be able to enter the system by telephone. a colour television screen as a
display device and an instrument with a digital keyboard will also be
necessary. information providers will need a keyboard similar to that of a
typewriter with some additional characters to obtain graphics. at present the
system is mainly oriented to users with digital keyboards which means that all
information has to be made available through numerical identification.
facility selection is made through an index process prepared by the user. the
procedure could be speeded up by creating a users' catalogue such as prestel
provides. if btx storage facilities are expanded and the speed of access is
improved it should provide additional possibilities for connecting general and
t echnical information systems. care should be taken to integrate this new
service without duplicating existing information and documentation services.

identifies present research directions in videotex services, including
research concerned with hardware and software, access to information, social
and behavioural implications, and methodological and regulatory matters. the
canadian telidon videotex system is generally perceived as a high-quality
alternative to the uk serial alpha-mosaic and french parallel alpha-mosaic
coding systems. intrinsic differences in the conceptual design of telidon have
created a quite different communication medium. new directions for research
and development (based upon a communication protocol independent of display,
carrier, and content and capable of responding to a variable scale
cost/quality continuum) provide opportunities for development significant to
both public and private sectors of the economy.

this brief review describes an experiment set up by the royal national
institute for the deaf, british telecom and the national research development
corporation (nrdc). the experiment involves 25 deaf people with a good command
of speech and explores the possibilities of holding telephone conversations
with hearing friends via a 'voice bureau'. nrdc equipment, called palantype,
is used and this allows the operator to type out the spoken word onto a
prestel-type tv screen, thus enabling the deaf person to see the
'conversation'. even if trials are successful, however, a general service will
only be envisaged if high operational costs can be overcome.

on-line services have been offered on a commercial basis in west germany since
1975, but are still not widely used. an example of an on-line service used in
industry is dokumentation maschinenbau (doma). this service has 17 users in
industry, mainly in mechanical engineering branches but also in electrical
engineering, chemical and consumer goods concerns. the users are generally
confined to large scale businesses employing between 1,000-25,000 people. to
make efficient use of the doma service it is necessary to have been running a
successful documentation department for several years, to use the on-line
service to implement the existing information activity and to have staff who
are kept up to date with research and development of on-line services. doma
provides personnel training and helps with installation of hardware besides
providing advice during the trial period. this aspect of on-line services is

the basic problem in freetext retrieval is that the retrieval language is not
properly adapted to that of the author. morphological segmentation, where
words with the same root are grouped together in the inverted file, is a good
eliminator of noise and information loss, providing high recall but low
precision. precision can be increased through the process described, whereby
semantic information from the morphological periphery of the roots can be
obtained, which can be very relevant in information retrieval. the process
involves relationships through derivative suffixes, prefixes and composite
terms, plus the use of link operators; various formulation possibilities are
illustrated. automatic inclusion of autonomous word structures is allowed.

during 1977 and 78 a survey was carried out into the reading habits of the
population of slovakia. the survey covered a number of parameters such as the
number of books read during a 4 months period in private libraries, the
frequency of public and trade union library visits and others. numerical
results of the survey are broken down and related to the socio-economic
structure of the population, educational level, job content and urban or rural
domicile. as an activity, reading lags behind tv viewing on workdays and
restdays and behind tv and 3 other activities on annual holidays for most
people. the librarians' best friend is the reader who spends over 3 hours
weekly reading, reads more than 10 books annually, possesses at least 50 books

the research project p-18-521-262-04 was concerned with detailed planning of
an automated system for the slovak national bibliography and its interface
with other systems in czechoslovakia and other socialist countries. overall,
it can be said that the slovak national bibliography is computerised. by 1 oct
80, the bibliographical data base contained more than 100,000 complete
bibliographical entries out of which 82,790 are entries 'articles 1979-1980',
15,370 are entries 'books 1976-1980' and the rest are entries concerned with
scientific experiments and other specialised topics. the number of direct
users of slovak bibliography is not the only criterion of its impact since it
enters into other information systems, data bases, catalogues, etc.

retrospective book bibliographies range from the 1st books printed before
1500, to 1965. foreign books on slovakia and the slovaks are also listed.
other bibliographies include slovak sheet music and gramophone records as well
as theoretical writings on music and its history. there are bibliographies of
special publications, for example exhibition catalogues and books for the
blind, and also of daily papers and periodicals, published in slovakia not
only in slovak, but also in other languages. calendars (1700-1965), slovak
professional, amateur and marionette theatre and radio and film (1918-1945)
are among other subjects of national bibliographies. the current computerised
slovak national bibliographies comprise sections a to j, covering books,
periodicals, maps, theses and dissertations, special publications,  trade
catalogues, technical newsletters, fine arts, sheet music, official government
publications, and audio-visual materials.

regulations on bibliography coordination in slovakia issued 2 years ago
stipulate 3 categories of bibliographic centres interlinked both vertically
and horizontally to bring about a comprehensive network, in which even
regional needs and demands are catered for. the scientific state library in
banska bystrica has the authority and responsibility to coordinate
bibliographies covering the antifascist resistance movement during world war
ii and the slovak national uprising in 1944. during the years 1979-80, the
total bibliographic output in this field was 6,400 copies of 39 headings, with
a total of 4,311 pages and 11,142 annotations. the next major task confronting

contribution to a special issue on us federal government printing and
publishing reform. there is no managerial precept to support the present
anomaly of congressional operation and control of federal printing and

documents required by congress. the provisions of the printing reform
legislation promise to perpetuate the bureaucratic inefficiences, squabbling,
red tape, and subterfuges prevalent in the printing and publishing policy
system. remedies which should be pursued include removing congressional
intrusion in these matters and establishing central responsibility in the

at present 97% of soviet families possess home libraries, and 70% of the
population reads for 1 hour daily. consequently traditional editions of
200,000 to 500,000 copies fail to satisfy demand. interlibrary loans and
providing libraries with supplementary copies of popular books could furnish
better satisfaction. booksellers, librarians and library-users should help to
determine size of editions. the media, readers and librarians should persuade
the public that reading books is more important than collecting them.
information used once only could appear in 'telejournals'. some publishers
should produce multi-million, moderately priced editions of classic and modern
literature for home use, while others provided large stoutly-bound editions
for public libraries. booksellers, publishers, librarians and readers should
join to discuss these questions.

introductions to a debate held at the 14th nordic library meeting in stockholm
aug 80. o. harbo distinguishes 4 types of library research and their uses. the
most important is research in the library professional area, i.e. research
into acquisition, storing and retrieval of information. the results can be
used directly, or indirectly for the educational benefit of the person
carrying out the research. many large development projects can only be carried
out by central library bodies. m. okko points to the dangers of library
research which is carried out for its usefulness only and iis directed by
outside interests. the theoretical results of basic library science must
permeate the professional thinking and practice. b. quentzer detects a
mistrust of scientific thinking in libraries. education for librarianship must
be changed so that it is more problem orientated and critical, thus an
interest in library research can be built up. includes contributions to  the
debate by g. renborg and e. starfelt.

comments on the report by the library school's working party on a programme
for library research, published autumn 80. the report shows lack of
classification principles and clear definitions. thus the terms library
research and library science are used interchangeably. the organisation of
library research is not discussed, and how research at the school can be
linked to ongoing field research is hardly dealt with. organizational contact
with goteborg university, as suggested, is not enough, links should also be
established with other research institutions and with the centre for
interdisciplinary studies. the suggested appointment of a documentalist to
document information on library research is praised. the programme should be
sent to libraries and research institutions for discussion before decisions
are made.

the library high school's working party on library research has now completed
its work and drawn up a programme. the background to the work was the reform
of higher education in 1977, which encouraged research, giving priority to'
development of foundation courses which encourage the students to make use of
new research results, further training of lecturers, and improvement of
facilities for lecturers to follow current research. the working party at its
1st meeting in aug 78 adopted these guidelines' to examine existing
educational plans to see how far they promote student use of library research;
to establish contact with international research; to promote research skills
among teachers of librarianship; to initiate research projects. a permanent
seminar for library research was set up in 1978 and participants were sent on
courses and conferences. an examination of on-going library-relevant research
in swedish scientific institutions was made  and to facilitate the monitoring
of this research a computer based index' nordic bdi index, has been created.
it remains to plan a course bridging the training of librarians and
researchers in the library and information field.

have meant to him). every time a patron asks a librarian to suggest a title,
the librarian thinks back, makes a suggestion, writes another chapter in his
version of miller's book, and repays the debt owed to the suggested title's
author (for enriching the librarian's life) by keeping his words alive.

financial concerns and lack of proper planning. contends that' academic
qualifications and field experience of instructors should be standardised;
institutions qualified to teach librarianship must be defined; the real
library needs of the country should be considered; quality must not be
sacrificed to output of graduates; and coordination between individual
institutions and the jla would be advantageous.

report of research initiated due to the fact that only 2 ohio library schools
accredited by the ala are located in northeastern ohio, merely 35 miles apart.
the study includes a needs assessment, a resources assessment, and an analysis
of 4 alternative approaches-a new programme model, a programme transfer model,
an extension model, and a consortium model. amongst the conclusions are the
following' northeastern ohio will continue to provide 40% of the professional
employment opportunities in the state through 1990; a new graduate school will
not be warranted in the 1980s because of the tight job market; and transfer of

summary of a thesis presented to the sittard school of library and information
studies in 1980. east germany has a highly developed network of public
libraries. in each of the country's 14 regions central libraries have been
designated to act as regional support centres for the smaller district and
local community libraries. library services are governed by the state library
act of 1968 and all libraries are members of the east german union of
libraries. in contrast to libraries in western europe libraries in east
germany have a strong political character and are compelled by law to support
the socialist economic system. all libraries are run by a library council with
representatives drawn from users, local organisations and other libraries.

describes the history of kiruna town library. it began in 1903 as a lending

council responsibility and the 1st professional librarian was appointed in
1930. circulating libraries to the outlying areas have been sent out, often by
unusual transport means, since 1940. the present building, where the library
has been housed from 1923, was extensively altered in 1980. the library
contains a unique collection of literature on the lapps and in lappish. a
local council mobile library has been operating since 1980 and the council
also cooperates in a nordic mobile library project which covers the border
areas of norway, finland and sweden. there are 2 mine libraries, 1 surface and

edited and abridged version of a talk given at the library association's
branch and mobile libraries group weekend school, lytham st. annes, oct-nov
80. although income-generating innovations will help the public library in the
short term, the resultant revenue will always be a relatively small proportion
of the budget and such activities could prejudice the library's long term
survival by giving the public the wrong impression. only a more business-like,
planned, balanced approach than previously practised can save the public
library. marketing can offer such an approach. the library should tailor
services to meet the needs of its community, train its staff to be
salespeople, and work on personal communication with the public.

reading rooms are vital in papua new guinea to provide access to the person
with no home study facilities. they should be part of the library building,
but outside the main library itself, and often after library hours.

in 1980, the national library of papua new guinea took responsibility for the
organisation of a national book week and coordinated activities, to promote an
awareness of books and the knowledge and enjoyment that can be gained from
them. posters and bookmarks were prepared, children's library hours were held,
and book exhibitions were organised. a general report by gillian howells is
followed by brief reports on activities at waigani community school, by mugen

delivered at the dedication of the east wing of the cecil h. green library,
stanford university, california, 11 apr 80. in the 7th century, the venerable

continuity in an age of few such outposts. suggests that the green library may
well become 'jarrow-on-the-pacific'. expands the analogy and urges the green
library to repay the debt owed to bede by building a collection for posterity.

argues that powerful operational research techniques operate only on a small
fraction of the statistical information usually provided by the social
sciences. uses the argument to illustrate leimkuhler's recent claim to have
found an 'exact' fit to bradford's law. an elementary theorem of shannon
information theory shows that his new function is applied to only 2.3% of the
statistical information inherent in the bibliography he chooses and that
bradford's original simple formulation not only fits this segment but also the
whole bibliography more closely than the new formulation. as every statistical
information loss can be measured, it can be shown that sophisticated
mathematical techniques cannot compensate for the information they squander.

the basis of a norwegian immigration policy is laid down in parliamentary
statements numbers 39 of 1973-74 and 74 of 1979-80. these emphasise that there
must be equality for all to practise religious, cultural, and social
activities. libraries must make literature and other media available so that
immigrants can maintain their cultural links with the mother country. but they
must also make material available which can facilitate that immigrants'
adaptation to the new country and its language and give the majority
population information on the immigrants' background. the deichman library in
oslo began in 1975 to act as a central library to public libraries as regards
immigrant literature. the library also issues deposits to libraries. stresses
the importance for children of competence in the mother tongue and calls for a
nordic cooperation in production of children's literature in immigrant

etailed review of the uses of microfilm in cathedral libraries. the aspects of
a library for which microfilm is most likely to be considered can be broadly
defined as holdings of original manuscripts and archives and any collections

introduction to british standards bs 5956:1980. the motor industry has, over
the years, gradually adopted the microfiche for the supply of information
relating to specification and service parts. a british standard has now been
produced, recommending the use of an a6 microfiche produced to a 48x with a
total of 270 landscape images per fiche as the preferred standard, with an
alternative of 420 portrait images also at 48x. the standard is recommended
for introduction by all new users in the motor industry of microfiche systems,
and also has a strong suggestion that those vehicle/engine manufacturers who
are already using a non-standard microfiche system consider changing in the
very near future.

operate as a professional association without a constitution, membership fees
or overt competition for executive positions. its aims include the
encouragement of library development, library projects and liaison within the
pacific region, and to provide a communication channel for project workers and
working groups. although it can operate on its present lines, scopal really
embodies a 'spirit of regionalism' which from time to time motivates
cooperation between individuals. its weakness is the lack of communication
between its members. the spirit of regional information cooperation must take

study concerned with the feasibility of establishing inter-library
comparisons. the scope of the study included' a series of visits to academic,
public and special libraries undertaken to familiarise cifc with the workings
of a sample of libraries; examination of the extent to which libraries might
be compared by interfirm comparison methods; indication of possible measures
of library performance; and discussion of follow-up activities with the blrd
and other interested organisations.

investigates the inter-relationships and possible meanings of the traditional
measures of public libraries in order to (1) understand the
inter-relationships between the individual measures that have been
traditionally maintained by libraries, identifying those that are redundant
and those that are unique; (2) determine the effects of each of these measures
on all other measures; and (3) understand the validity of these measures,
singly or in combination with others, as indicators of library effectiveness.
the data used is that collected in the 1974 us public libraries survey, which
asked for data on 60 measures.

reports research carried out in 1977-78 in which multiple regression analysis
was used to test the performance of (mainly) resource variables in explaining
the level of circulation in public libraries in victoria, australia. concludes
that' the levels of the variables explain very high proportions of the
variance of library use; researchers are not yet justified in calling the
observed relationships input-output functions; and, despite this, the strength
of these relationships provides a powerful tool for comparing performances of
libraries and for predicting future performance of a given library.

describes the logan square experimental book branch of chicago public library.
this branch library is aiming to provide a better service to existing users
and makes no attempt to 'outreach' to the community. staff resources have
decreased during the experiment and the book budget is consistent with those
of similarly-sized libraries. in 1978-79 (the experiment's 1st year), the
bookstock was increased from 45,000 to 66,500 volumes (mainly by accepting
discards from other branches) and a magazine collection was started. after
declining for 10 years, circulation increased by 19% in 1979. it is too early
to analyse the experiment's results, but the future looks good. perhaps this
is a true measure of public library effectiveness.

describes the development of an analysis of levels of service (service
adequacy) at california state university, northridge, library. the analysis
incorporates the determination of what service a particular task provides (and
for whom) and the criteria by which the professional library staff judge the
service's adequacy. gives true examples involving 11 library tasks.

reports on an investigation into the effectiveness of new south wales college
of advanced education libraries which covered the libraries' objectives,
techniques being used to evaluate the libraries (particularly the reference
service), and factors contributing to the effective performance of the
reference service. the investigation was also a pilot study to test a
methodology for establishing the proportion of questions for which library
staff provide complete, correct answers and the time taken. discusses the
results obtained and the difficulty of evaluating reference services because
of the many inter-related factors involved.

when an adult student undertakes a course of study, he usually passes through
3 main stages' (1) finding out about the courses available; (2) obtaining
materials and information during the course; and (3) following-up particular
interests after the course. describes a library's involvement in all 3 stages,
how the library can most effectively serve adult part-time students, and
implications for library management.

presents the findings of an investigation into library effectiveness in terms
of meeting citizens' information needs. residents from 2,400 randomly-selected
households in the new england states of the usa participated in 15-minute
telephone interviews, july-oct 79. it appears that they infrequently consult
libraries as an information resource in work or non-work situations. of the
17% using libraries, the majority (11%) do not have strong feelings about the
library as an information provider. to become more effective competitors with
other information providers, libraries must publicise resources and services
more effectively, improve document delivery capability, and identify and
reduce barriers encountered by the citizen when attempting to gain access to
information.

presents and analyses the results of a user satisfaction survey of st. paul's
public library, minnesota. 245 questionnaires were distributed and 208 usable
ones were returned. the survey was based on a conceptual model which treats
user satisfaction as a function of (1) the user's demographic characteristics,
(2) the various uses made of the library by the user, and (3) the user's
evaluation of the characteristics of the library used.

describes research undertaken to broaden the theoretical base on which
effectiveness of library services can be determined, to translate findings
into operational terms, and to test operationally a system of assessing and
monitoring effectiveness on the basis of the findings. the methodology
developed was centred on a library user questionnaire in which the users were
asked to rate the relative importance, level of user satisfaction, user
benefit, and effectiveness of each library service. the questionnaire was
tested in a college, with promising results. this line of research is

questionnaire was distributed to 20 university libraries (5 in indonesia, 5 in
malaysia, 4 in the philippines, 2 in singapore and 4 in thailand). the
questionnaire was divided into 2 parts, covering basic statistics/information,

note. an english translation of this article is published in scientific and
technical information processing, (1) 1980, 42-51. a method is presented which
makes it possible to improve the effectiveness of meeting users' demands for
documentation. the method, which is based on optimisation of the structure of
the existing documentation/information stock of a republic, treats the stock
as an integrated system consisting of several sub-systems. the organisational
and functional changes of the stock of libraries and information centres are
minimal.

a systems approach based on an analysis of library activities represents a
starting point assuring wide theoretical generalisation of the acquired
knowledge while allowing a continuous link with reality. a library system, by
its specific character, is part of a wide community system, fulfilling
specific tasks in the society. the concept 'library system' is defined and
other issues concerning the theory of library systems investigated.

an overview of the impact of funding restrictions on large us academic
libraries during 1969-78. through most of the decade, the libraries relied on
a series of strategies designed to minimise or hide their financial problems,
shifting from monographic to serials expenditure and eliminating duplicates.
only in the last few years have they been forced to turn to consortia and
networks to alleviate the pressures on them. the libraries must face their
problems squarely in the 1980s and produce leaders with the astuteness,
courage, and persuasiveness to make faculty and administrators understand the
problems. only then, within the framework of inter-institutional accord, will
academic library cooperative activities move forward more rapidly and
purposefully.

submitted in spring 80 was cut from $11.3 million to $9.3 million and a
further cut of 35% is rumoured); outlines the resultant damage to services
(bookmobile service, multilingual library, and hospital library service units
all closed; opening hours everywhere severely curtailed); and discusses the

hitting all local government revenues). outlines the resultant cuts and
economies and describes the work of the public library's friends who staff the
main library information desk for 50 hours weekly, publicise the library's
activities, and raise money. briefly describes some collections in the main

covers the past, present and future of library automation in the usa. begins
with the establishment of networks, describing the role of oclc and adoption
of marc. the 2nd step is seen as the growth of on-line data bases, with
particular reference to lockheed, sdc and brs. costs, though, have deterred
full use of these. makes a case for standardisation of formats. the effect of
on-line systems on retrieval is related to the increasing interest in document
delivery systems. notes the contribution of mini- and microcomputers to this
area. centralised shared systems have allowed automation to progress. all this
needs paralleling in the library schools which have difficulty in providing
the facilities. the real problem lies in making systems user friendly. perhaps
librarians should cultivate self-sufficiency in programming, using easy
high-level languages like forth and speakeasy. word processors also will need
to be a standard part of library  equipment. the future must lie in achieving
access to all information from a terminal.

both the 14.5 million population and the distance which australia is from the
major publishing centres may account for the enthusiasm for new technology.
australian libraries were early users of microcomputers. a growth in the
country's telecommunications has culminated in the introduction of midas in
79, and use of on-line data bases via lockheed, sdc and oclc. access to data
bases within australia is now achieved through ausinet and csironet. this has
promoted library automation, dealt with here in 3 phases' (1) relates to
punched-card systems; (2) is characterised by the introduction of ausmarc in
71, and the australian marc record service; and (3) covers the shared systems
and cooperative networks. briefly surveys the future which seems largely
dependent on the success of the national library of australia's development
programme for hardware and software to provide a nationwide service.

a case study examining the general effects of automating operations in a
medium sized academic library on both the staff and the organisation over a 10
year period reveals that the major impact has been the reappraisal of
functional objectives and their accomplishment. in regard to personnel, there
has been an overall saving in labour costs, and while it has decreased
professional staff requirements, it has increased support staff positions,
many of which require greater skill, experience, and training. report not

establish the personal conceptions of the candidates with regard to a career
in library science; (4) to measure the effect that the school has upon the
choice of librarianship as a career; (5) to identify what branch of library

nationally and in a sample of british libraries. chapter 1 shows the variety
of unions recruiting such staff and sketches the roles played by nalgo, aut
(association of university teachers), natfhe (national association of teachers
of further and higher education), apt (association of polytechnic teachers)
and astms (association of scientific, technical and managerial staffs). also
discusses the part played by the library association and the relationship
between these organisations. chapter 2 covers areas of concern of unions at
national and local level under the headings' industrial relations; policy;
education and training; and political concerns. chapter 3 comments on
involvement of library staffs in union affairs and their attitudes to unions.
chapter 4 suggests alternative negotiating machinery for librarians in nalgo

paper presented to the meeting of the centrum voor literatuuronderzoekers
(centre for information specialists), amsterdam, 15 oct 80. the trend towards
decentralisation of administrative and technical support services in
industrial organisations and the increasing use of automation in libraries
will have a profound effect on the work of the information specialist. the
professional organisations concerned with librarianship and information
science must publicise the work of their members more effectively in the
centres of higher education and at industrial management training courses. the
information specialist must convince the management of his organisation that
automation will not enable duties normally performed in the library to be
taken over by technical staff. the information specialist must also be allowed
to participate in the policy planning of his organisation.

the past few years have seen many changes in the cataloguing departments of us
research libraries. reduced budgets, less emphasis on perfection, greater use
of library assistants, standardisation, and automation have had a profound
effect upon the professional responsibility of cataloguers. if current trends
continue, future emphasis will be on the sharing of high quality bibliographic
records through a national network. as the amount of original cataloguing
decreases, the cataloguer of the future will more likely be a manager with
responsibility for the library's bibliographic control system. only in larger
research institutions will a significant amount of original cataloguing
remain. another possible scenario will be the disappearance of cataloguers as
public and technical services staff merge into integrated subject units.

an international seminar on libraries as public information centres indicates
that norway is possibly the most advanced of the scandinavian countries (the
swedish report is not available). moves are afoot to convince committees that
public libraries, until now overlooked, are already largely equipped as
information centres. in denmark a library commission was set up in 1976 to
consider alterations in the danish library service, including the formation of
a national information and library policy, and legislation is expected
following their 1979 report. in iceland a committee was established in 1975 to
plan future information policy, and an information service, partly
technical/scientific and partly a general national information body, began
operation in 1978-79. finland has so far had no official information policy,

major us library schools were questionned on their approach to patent
information teaching and in the 2nd, several dozen major us industrial
libraries were asked about patent handling and management. although there are
over 30 patent depositories in the usa, the average research librarian does
not make complete use of them and, in some cases, is even unaware of these
data sources. describes the management and use of patents in the general
electric company; on-line patent information retrieval systems; and how
libraries might retrieve patents and patent applications before the end of

53,713 reports of official searches carried out for the european patent

whether it would have been possible to limit the searches to documents from a
certain country, to patent documents only, or to certain time spans only. it
seems that in certain fields (such as mechanics) the search could disregard
non-patent literature, but all other limitations seem to result in a loss of

patent applications in west germany are filed by small and medium-sized
industries (smi) or private inventors. many smi, however, do not make full use
of the protection offered by patenting and they have only recently
acknowledged the importance of patent literature as a source of technical
information. analyses some explanations for this; outlines the advantages of
patent protection; and concludes that the west german patent office should

shows in which case it is expedient to specialise a fragment and also when it
is worth drawing together several subfragments into one fragment. the process
can easily be expressed as a computer algorithm, and in this way it can be
useful for a set of computerised systems for spectrum analysis.

the navy oceanographic requirements (nor) relate to the
oceanographic/environmental needs of navy systems and fleet units in a wide
variety of scientific and technological disciplines. the nor data base is a
collection of information pertaining to the current needs expressed by the
fleet or derived from system specifications. the same closed vocabulary
keyword system used in the navy oceanographic program (nop) data base is used
to provide correlation between the datasets. this data base has been turned
over to the naval oceanographic office, information systems office, for
operation as part of the overall oceanographic management information system.

the existing procedures utilised by travel enquiry clerks, when answering
inquiries on journeys involving interchange, are often cumbersome and
sometimes slow. the use of a computer to compile travel information would thus
appear to be of benefit to travellers and public transport operators alike by
providing the facilities for quicker, more accurate and consistent responses
to inquirers. the practicability of producing computer software that would
generate schedules of trip-opportunities from the public transport timetables
was investigated by the transport and road research laboratory. (see also

purpose was to assess the state-of-the-art in local government computing,
evaluate its impact on government services and management decision-making, and
develop recommendations for the better use of information technology.
computing in over 700 us cities and counties was studied extensively and more
detailed information was then collected in 42 cities. it was found that
well-managed computer technology has real pay-offs, but that it was not
well-managed in most cities, creating pervasive problems and producing

the problem of inadequate library education in primary and secondary schools
has far-reaching results. academic librarians must teach students the basics
of library use before embarking on course-related instruction-all in a very
short time and with reduced success. school leavers who go directly into the
work force-the very people who most need and could best profit from
libraries-will never have effective library access. this makes the lives of
many poorer and more difficult; denies them some measure of satisfaction,
success, and happiness; and erodes society's ability to deal with critical
problems and govern itself. children must learn reading, writing, arithmetic,
and library use together.

given to students in the use of libraries and information sources. more
recently the dutch government in a policy document issued in 1980 recognised
the growing need for access to information in a modern, highly-industrialised

of the sdi service is successful. in 1978, out of the 150,000 sdi items sent
out, only 15% were returned by the users as irrelevant. as far as the latter
user group is concerned, the contact between the information centre and the

the telephone reference services of public and private college and university
libraries in the 9 southeastern states of the usa were investigated using
their responses to 12 fact-seeking telephone queries made over a 12-month
period, their 1975 library general information survey data, and a
questionnaire designed to identify independent variables related to reference
services. only 50% of the test questions were answered correctly. independent
variables such as service hours or volumes held were more closely related to
accuracy of response than variables concerned with staff, indicating that
staff ability to exploit a collection is more crucial than staff numbers.

reference services.

in nov 71, an ad-hoc committee of librarians at washington state university
was asked to determine if effectiveness measures could be applied to reference
activities and, if so, to propose some method for collecting the necessary
data. several effectiveness models were studied and discarded. the committee
then tried the managerial rating model, whereby managers meet to identify
goals and objectives, then reconvene after a given time to rate their levels
of accomplishment. a trial indicated that this model was suitable and the
committee reported accordingly, but no full trial ever took place and the
committee was disbanded. suggests that this was due to the method's possible
disadvantages and a lack of interest.

the key to the objective branching analysis of reference services is the

as peak times of heavist reference use, type of reference questions, time
spent in answering questions, type of employee answering questions, adequacy
of responses, reasons for inadequate answers, and whether professional staff
were answering the more sophisticated questions. analysis of the data
indicated that such information could be used for the administration of an
academic library reference service and that a standardised data form could be
used for both general reference service and reference service in a specialised
subject area.

quality of public library reference services or to single out individual
libraries; instead it demonstrates a new methodology which can produce data
beyond the merely quantitative data which previously could be interpreted, for

the term document delivery encompasses various forms of providing primary
documents which have already been processed in bibliographies and by sdi
services. document delivery services notify the users of the possibilities of
obtaining the primary sources in the form of photocopies of periodical
articles and by interlibrary loans in the case of books. from 19 references to
literature dealing with this form of dissemination of information, 5 are of
czech origin, the rest drawing attention to the 'universal availability of

reviews 6 experimental studies of book availability conducted at the 2 major
libraries of case western reserve university, ohio-the sears library (physical

studies show how certain management decisions have influenced book
availability in these libraries and how certain other events, over which
management had little control, have compromised efforts to improve book
availability.

librarians are constantly faced with the task of supplying literature on
rapidly developing subjects, especially in technology and medicine. mechanical
information retrieval is apt to yield vast amounts of references which have to
be weeded out. criteria for this vary, but are usually dictated by necessity,
namely the actual availability of documents. thus the user can readily be
supplied with the relevant literature in well known journals stocked by the
library. it is questionable whether the user gets a good coverage initially,
or whether he must insist on total retrieval of documents. the problem of
selection will probably become more acute in the future. a possible solution
is to analyse the growth and spread of papers relevant to a specific topic in
broader based journals.

divides the concept into' popular and amateur culture, nurtured by societies
and study circles and exemplified by biennial art exhibitions, an anthology of
poems, craft demonstrations and musical events during the summer; high
culture, as represented by the drama, art and chamber music societies and the
library which aim to preserve the cultural heritage; and children's culture.
this aspect is neglected as the library has a poor children's section and no
children's librarian.

library activities aim to encourage and enliven library use. readings and
talks have become an integral part of children's library service, and other
activities include story hours, drama, quizzes, competitions and reading
programmes. these motivate reading and orientate children within the library.
non-book materials can also be a means to achieve the objectives of library
activities.

because tasks and materials related to serials processing and use are often
dispersed in a library, serials specialists must develop personal influence
strategies and use informal communications systems which cross organisational
boundaries. in the absence of a serials department, serials specialists and
informal serials communication systems will continue to exist. it is widely
agreed that informal communication systems emerge spontaneously in
organisations and individuals with no formally conferred authority may use
various types of personal influence strategies to achieve organisational
objectives. while serials processing and public service could be most
efficiently handled through a serials department, informal communication
systems, utilised by serials specialists, will develop if such a department
does not exist. in determining if a serials department has a place in a
particular library organisation, library planners should be concerned a bout
natural communication channels and should try to identify individuals who can
communicate effectively across organisational barriers.

provide a central control of the north yorkshire library bookstock and to
produce a catalogue of the county stock. it was decided to use the british

a talk given in connection with the 14th nordic library meeting. examines the
literature available on the subject of acquisition. much of this results from
seminars and conferences. 1 of the problems arising in the area of acquisition
is unwanted duplicates. double acquisition may be caused by monographs which
have already been ordered as part of a series. choice of bookseller is also
crucial. other problems concern calculation of price increases and the use of
exchanges. the mechanisation of routines, such as cataloguing and accounting
and the automation of booksellers' data have consequences for acquisition. new
tendencies in publishing, such as exclusive publication in microform, can
cause problems of control and retrieval. the problems surrounding photocopying

situation regarding foreign material is especially critical. identifies the
major collecting problems as' loss of depository receipts; inadequate funding
support; inflated map prices; increased production; and government
restrictions. suggests that these problems could be resolved by obtaining
better internal and external support through planning, organised action, and
cooperative efforts, and highlights the need for library administrators to

academic library collections have, historically, been selected by the faculty
of the institution which they library serves. recently, however, much
responsibility for collection development has devolved upon librarians who are
eager to retain and amplify their role in this area. arguments presented in
favour of lodging collection development responsiblity with librarians are,
however, less than convincing and ignore important realities to make their
case. librarians often confuse the ability to select books with accountability
for such selection. argues that book selection is more properly and more
adequately done by faculty members than librarians, and suggests a way of
dealing with the problem of accountability often encountered when faculty are
responsible for selection.

library literature has long ignored the problem of collection development for
u.s. government publications. regional depositories are not adversely affected
by this oversight. however, the partial depository library suffers the
consequences. often in the past, the sole criterion for the building of a
partial depisitory collection has been accretion without regard for other
salient factors. at present and in the foreseable future, fiscal exigency will
cause increasing demands to be made on the library's budget and space. in
order to make judicious decisions which will permit the depotisory collection
to grow in a manner responsive to its own needs, as well as to various
curricular and community needs, a framework of policy must exist. it is in
this context that a policy statement is presented.

for part 1 see 80/3195. library and information managers have become

examines the borrowing patterns of 15 academic members of the south central

state), the effects of the introduction of the oclc/ill subsystem on their
interlibrary loan patterns, and the transition from the use of nysill (new
york state interlibrary loan) to use of oclc/ill. finds that oclc/ill has had
a major impact-material requested is arriving significantly faster, the load
on major research libraries has been reduced, and smaller libraries can now
share the load in filling interlibrary loan transactions. 25-50% of requested
monographs are less than 5 years old-perhaps it would be more efficient to
purchase them. retrospective collection conversion would be of value to
interlibrary loans if carried out within the next 5 years.

the government is the greatest collector and user of information. statistics
canada has identified 2,352 major government data banks in canada. in response
to a growing recognition that government has gone too far in its data
collection activities, it is trying to reduce its 'paperburden'. perhaps one
solution is to institute a rational and consistent strategy for archiving
these government data, but still meet the needs of the research community.
suggests that the canadian government must establish the information over
which it has ownership and the condition of such ownership; no government
record may be destroyed or altered without consent from the dominion archivist
or his designate; and the dominion archivist must have the right to declare
any government record or copy thereof an archival record.

application of rules for weeding that are based upon the unequal distribution
of demand over the collection require that the distribution remain stable over
time. a mathematical expression is derived that tests that stability.
verification of the expression is not inordinately time consuming and is very
easy in the case of automated circulation systems. the technique was first
introduced by richard w. trueswell un 2american documentation1 (16) 1965,

as a small to medium-sized library, carnegie-mellon university libraries'
approach to library automation was to aim for an integrated system. it was
decided to label all items with machine-readable identifiers and enter the
unique identifier into the data base at the time each record was created. the
rationale for these decisions is discussed. different types of
machine-readable identification systems are reviewed. the type of labels
chosen and the procedures used for labeling items and for entering the barcode

oriel's approach to the design of a circulation system matches its approach to
its other library automation services. it has been designed in a modular
fashion to meet the needs of a particular library. the approach is to discuss
with staff the library needs and requirements and from these to design a
system which meets those needs at minimum cost. a circulation system has been
operating successfully in a public library in europe for several months. the
general system requirements, system elements, network, hardware, system
facilities and other services are described in detail.

the geac terminals at hull university are standard, comprising keyboard, vdu
and lightpen and the system is run on a geac 8000 mini. files are stored on
2x300 megabyte discs. since hull had no existing machine-readable catalogue, a
full record of all stock had to be compiled. the automated circulation control
system at present operates only on a small section of the stock, but it is
hoped to extend this to all classes. economic stringency obliged hull to
discard its flexible and effective manual system and replace it with an
efficient and easily-used system. geac fulfilled the university's needs, and
the partial system operating at present meets hull's requirements.

feelings that cataloguing codes are completely sensible and trustworthy and

describes the operation, within the college's multi-site library, of an
on-line periodicals control system, developed completely in-house, which
replaced an inefficient manual system. each subscription record holds details
of title, alternative title, location code and subject code and is composed of
fixed-length fields with a-character alphanumeric control number. fields
include frequency, issues per volume and price, and each entry may be termed
'alive' or 'inactive'. library records were then converted to machine-readable
form and may now be sorted by location, type and subject/department. the
simple accessioning procedures are detailed. the system which went live in jan

indicate that most original cataloguing contributed by this library was not
superseded or duplicated by library of congress cataloguing and that many

in 1978, ontario's university of waterloo discovered a backlog of books in its
cataloguing department after a cataloguing revision and the implementation of
full marc coding. a new approach to coping with the backlog proved very
successful. a 5-point procedure was followed' (1) evaluate present operation
and various tasks; (2) analyse these tasks to detect non-productive areas or
areas in need of improvement; (3) design a solution; (4) document the new
procedures; and (5) implement the solution. the procedures highlighted the
fact that more time was spent in finding catalogue copy than in any other
task. when this time was cut down through the use of the marc distribution
service of the national library, the system proved suitably streamlined to
eliminate the backlog in the cataloguing department.

this discussion of the use of com as a feasible alternative to the library
card catalogue includes a brief history of library catalogues and of microform
technology since world war ii. it is argued that com cataloguees are to be
preferred to card catalogues, on-line catalogues accessed by terminals, and
paper printouts. advantages and disadvantages of film or fiche formats for a
library catalogue are explored in relation to retrieval performance, cost, and
ease of use, and such features as updating procedures, readability, and
possible patron reluctance to use com are discussed in greater depth. it is
concluded that com appears to be the most viable answer to new demands placed

the school of library and information studies, university of california at

series of 'catalogue look-up' quizzes, answering similar sets of questions
through the use of film and fiche versions of the same catalogue. the 1st test
employed average library users-students and their non-student acquaintances.
the 2nd test focussed on campus library staff. the results suggest that there
is very little difference in the ease or difficulty of use of microfilm and
microfiche and that the decision on which to install should be based on
grounds other than ease of use.

the work being carried out by the committee for descriptive cataloguing must
be seen on the background of international developments, such as ifla's work
with isbd, aacr2, and scandinavian attempts to reach compatibility with
international standards. the need for rules for the registration of different
media, which aacr 2 supplies, is pressing. but a direct translation of aacr 2
into swedish is not possible, as some points need discussion, such as aacr 2's
restrictive rules for institutions and the differences between aacr 2 and some
isbd variants. the committee hopes to present a manual in jan 82. the
consequences of this should be elimination of differences in cataloguing rules

the government printing office projects a 10% annual increase in sales over

survey, conducted in 1979-1980, sought to provide reliable data on staff size
and type, collection size and arrangement, and methods employed to provide
descriptive and subject access to federal documents in the depository system.
results indicated that on the average about 40% of depository items were being
selected yearly and arranged in some form of separate collection. 1 in 4
libraries does not provide any descriptive access; less than 6% of the
libraries provide some subject access. computer technology (particularly in
the form of on-line bibliographic services) is modestly used; only 1/3 of the

the different types of new, non-printing technologies which disseminate
information are explained. descriptions are given of a magnetographic printer
designed by dupont, teletex, teletext, viewdata and teletel, a french viewdata
system which may well be used to provide an electronic telephone directory.
wide-band cable networks and laser-based information storage systems are also
discussed. the implications for the printing industry of these new
technologies are examined.

an assessment of the potential of 2-way communication systems based on the
telephone and television up to 1989 is presented. the report considers the use
of viewdata, or videotex, systems in the uk, france and west germany. home,
business and public use of such systems are discussed and compared. while the
majority of the report is devoted to europe, a section deals with the us,
japan and canada.

the way in which social agencies and voluntary organisations could make use of
teletext and viewdata to disseminate information about their work to seek
volunteers, to raise money and to provide an information service in their area
of work is discussed.

.I 1420

teletext and viewdata displays present a strong challenge to the information
designer. the monospaced dot matrix characters are relatively crude in their
design, and their positioning is determined by a fixed grid. the graphics
facility is also somewhat crude. the scope for typographic and spatial coding
of information is therefore very limited. there is, however, the possibility
of using colour as a way of coding information. 7 colours, including white,
are available, but they are not of equal brightness and this has important
implications for legibility. bearing in mind the constraints and freedom
offered by this kind of display, ways of presenting text, tables, indexes and
graphics of various kinds are discussed.

.I 1421

viewdata applications are said to be divided into 4 main areas' residential,
public, business, and specialised. predicts that, within 3 years, the ratio of
domestic to business users will be around 5 to 1. various applications are
described (e.g. viewdata adapted to help the deaf communicate via telephone).
particular reference is made to the use of microcomputers as videotex
receivers (or vice versa) to form the basis of telesoftware. a bright future
is predicted for viewdata and teletext with plenty of potential for diverse
applications, especially when coupled with home microcomputers.

.I 1422
.W
the prospects for using a viewdata system to meet the needs of the office are
considered. the shift of emphasis from the home to business applications is
shown, and this is extended to private viewdata systems. 5 levels of
sophistication are envisaged, from individual users to international services.
business organisation and equipment which may be seen in the future are
discussed.

.I 1423
.W
describes the main algorithms in a computer program for interfacing a viewdata
terminal with arbitrary application computer programs (which were not
specially written for the terminal). the interface handles the problems of
partioning the input and output to or from the application to suit the small
and non-scrolling screen of the viewdata terminal.

brighton polytechnic (in collaboration with itv and bbc) is conducting a
project to study the educational implications of teletext. 10 suitable
television sets will be placed in schools, teaching materials will be produced
for them and their use will be monitored. the bbc's ceefax, itv's oracle and
the gpo's prestel form the basis for the experiment, but it is felt that these
have shown certain limitations for educational use in the past. a new
development, telesoftware, could overcome such limitations. telesoftware
allows the user to 'talk' to the television set, pages of information become
instantly available, some pages can carry instructions, and specific
programmes for microcomputer use may be received.

until recently, data quality was poorly understood and seldom achieved, yet it
is essential to the effective use of information systems. discusses the nature
and importance of data quality. the role of data quality is placed in the life
cycle framework. many new concepts, tools and techniques from both programming
languages and data base management systems are presented and related to data
quality. in particular, the concept of a data base constraint is considered in
detail. some current limitations and research directions are proposed.

the application of minicomputers in information storage and retrieval. the
domestic software package includes functions for on-line creation and udating
of inhouse data bases; assimilation of external data bases; setting up,
running and reformulating on-line searches; viewing search results; printing
the output in selected formats; and acquisitions, cataloguing and circulation
tasks. by june 80, the data base management system and information retrieval
functions had been programmed and development was under way on the functions
for on-line input, data base maintenance, print generator, and library
management.

the study evaluated on-line searching performed on the national library of
medicine system to identify implications for training and continuing
education. searchers were selected with formal and informal training, from 3
different types of organisation, and with differing levels of experience. it
was found that most searchers have mastered the basics of searching, and that
performance was unaffected by source of training, experience, organisational,
or even subject educational background. the most consistent source of
difference in performance was the difficulty of the search itself. report not

mps at the british house of commons have urgent information needs. the house
of commons library produces 9 strip indexes of information, but these have
disadvantages, in that entries usually appear under 1 heading, only selected
parliamentary questions have been indexed, and the library's 3 locations make
access difficult. in 1979 a new data base was begun, and it will form a single
index to all material previously held on strip indexes, and other information
such as parliamentary questions. describes the input flow for the new on-line
data base-polis, and details of the system configuration are given.

chemical abstracts service (cas) has been involved with chemical patent
information since it began in 1907. by the early 1970s, its manual data
processing system for patents was showing signs of strain with a million
records already and 200,000 being added annually. to convert to a computerised
system would require 25,000 man-hours if existing records were to be contained
in the new system. the solution to this problem was found in 1977. an
agreement was negotiated with inpadoc (the international patent documentation
centre) for inpadoc to deliver to cas a back-file of 1.2 million patent
records in computer-readable form and weekly tapes of current patent
bibliographic information. describes how cas selects patents from the tapes
and the format of the new patent index, derived from the inpadoc data and
introduced in jan 81.

of ussr data bases, amongst which are' the all-union institute of scientific
and technical information which prepares machine readable versions of its
information publications; the central scientific research institute of patent
information and technical and economical studies which processes patent
information from comecon countries which is included in the inpadoc database;

a study was carried out in order to establish whether fragments, which have an
independent meaning as far as the information needs of specialists are
concerned, can be extracted from the text of documents. it is shown that it is
possible to create a file called 'fragment' and to use this file, together
with documentary and data files, to produce an integrated information system.
the 'fragment' file represents a new type of information service' in response
to aspect enquiries, a number of relevant fragments can be located without
using primary sources. the problems connected with the selection and indexing
of the fragments are discussed.

a set of experiments was conducted to determine the suitability of the colon
classification as a foundation for the automated analysis, representation and
retrieval of primary information from the full text of documents. full text
data bases were created in 2 subject areas and queries solicited from
specialists in each area. an automated full text indexing system, along with 4
automated passage retrieval systems, was created to test the various features
of the colon classification. 2 boolean-based systems and 1 simple word
occurrence system were created in order to compare the retrieval results
against types of systems which are in more common use. the systems' retrieval
performances were measured using recall and precision and the mean expected
search length reduction factors. overall, colon-based systems did not perform
significantly better than the other systems.

in a particular library the bookstock is a heterogenous entity which consists
of materials in different subjects and languages, with different chronological
and regional connotations which serve a broad spectrum of readers. thus, the
available bookstock naturally subdivides into a number of entities which
belong to the same category and the subject matter appears to be the most
important criterion. large libraries in slovakia e.g. university libraries
have specific reading rooms for partial bookstock e.g. natural sciences or
librarianship. special partial bookstock may consist of internal publications
such as theses, research reports, internal translations and others. in dealing
with partial bookstock it is important to establish the type of reader using
it (e.g. children), the physical form of the stock (traditional or micro),
geographical relevance and the frequency of its usage. the differential aspect
of bookstock is well worth bearing i n mind for the most effective way of
utilising library resources.

analyses of fiction have indicated that fiction plays a more significant and
valuable role in society than appreciated and is the most important literature
form at the public library level. the habit of arranging fiction in
alphabetical order by author presents the majority of readers with a daunting
problem of choice. categorisation by subject matter has been shown to satisfy
the previously hidden and unexpressed desires of readers for previously unseen
types of fiction. this increases the library's effectiveness. with an emphasis
on the reader, discusses other factors influencing library effectiveness.

physically disabled. librarians and other professionals must gain an
understanding of the perspectives and concerns of disabled people, and this is
best gained from personal contact. where this is not possible, reading of the
periodical literature published for and by the disabled is recommended. these
periodicals have changed as the information demands of the disabled have

the 1959 national printing strike forced many companies and organisations to
install in-house printing units, and many later added microform units. the low
average quality of microform produced and the poor economic viability of such
units, suggest that perhaps in these times of recession and increasing
competition it would be advantageous for many large organisations to cut back
on such luxuries and start to support small local service businessmen more.

paper presented and the micrographics in banking and insurance seminar,
bristol, mar 80. presents an outline of the structure and organisation of the
guardian royal exchange assurance company, a composite insurance company
dealing in all classes of insurance. for legal reasons paper records are
important, since, although microfilm is accepted by courts, the evidence on it
may not be accepted. use of microfilm to save space in keeping records has to
be simple and cost-effective. a pilot scheme was launched at 5 branches, using
16 of the largest and most suitable tabulations for microfilm. a report on
problems in the use of microfilm was produced, highlighting resistance to
change, and criticisms of the microreader. a modified front projection reader
was obtained and was received with much acclaim. the conversion of computer
tabulated output to com is reaching its conclusion, and the company is now
looking at conventional microfilming of p aper records.

personal account of the national micrographics association conference and
exposition, new york, apr 80. the conference theme was 'focus on

sessions, banking/finance sessions and integrated technology sessions.
delegates were more optimistic about the future of the industry than are their
uk counterparts. the exposition attracted about 150 exhibitors. the prime
interest was in com, and the exhibition was less gimmicky than expected.

it will be apparent from the problems facing papua new guinea today; the
obstacles found in the terrain, the inadequate road systems, the cultural and
linguistic diversity, the unequal social and educational development of its
people, that the establishment of a nationwide library service, even at the
primary school level, and the spread of information relevant to the people's
way of life and helpful in a time of urgent change, is an enormous task. to
speak of extending services where almost none exist would be to ignore the
realities affecting the development of school libraries and other means of
keeping people informed through the medium of print. some proposals for
increasing the efficiency of primary schools to enable them to serve the
community in different ways are offered.

1980 was the 150th anniversary of greenland's 1st public library (in the
capital, godthab) and was also the year in which responsibility for the
country's library service passed from denmark to greenland's home government.
briefly outlines the service's history up to 1956 and describes subsequent
events in greater detail. in 1956, a proper country-wide service was
established to provide danish-language children's books to support teaching of
danish in schools, and greenlandic material for those speaking only that
language. the main library in godthab (later designated the greenland national
library) began to build a collection of greenlandic material. the library
service's main handicap is the acute shortage of material in greenlandic.

contribution to a special issue on application of qualitative approaches to
the study of information problems. an in-depth discussion of one qualitative
approach-ethnography. its distinctive character derives from its underlying
methodological principles-a concern with the discovery, generation, and
development, as well as testing, of theory; a commitment to learning the
culture of those being studied; and a recognition of the importance of
context. against this background, outlines some ethnographical
techniques-grounded theorising (theoretical sampling and the constant
comparative method) and testing theory (triangulation and analytic induction).
stresses that this is a research tradition still in the throes of development.

contribution to an issue on the application of qualitative approaches to the
study of information problems. considers why quantitative methods are believed
to be more 'scientific', rigorous, and valid than qualitative ones and argues
that the term 'qualitative' is applied to different aspects of research which
are sufficiently independent of each other to make the
quantitative/qualitative distinction artificial. suggests that criticisms of
qualitative research are 'ideological in the sense that they give support to
existing institutions wherein some classes or groups (research sponsors) try
to exert control over others'. typical criticisms of such research are
analysed to expose the nature of the underlying expressions of interest.

contribution to an issue on the application of qualitative approaches to the
study of information problems. an account of the background against which a
non-traditional strategy of evaluation was adopted in newcastle-upon-tyne
polytechnic's travelling workshops experiment (see 77/3731). the clear-cut
distinctions originally envisaged for the internal and external components of
the evaluation became blurred and there was conflict between pressures for a
traditional, tightly-controlled evaluation and the researchers' preference for
a more explanatory evaluation strategy. illuminative evaluation was used; this
eschews pre- and post-testing in favour of a wide-ranging study of the
contextual determinants of a venture's success. its use poses many problems
because it is a broad strategy rather than a set of specific techniques.

.I 1514
.W
contribution to an issue devoted to the application of qualitative approaches
to the study of information problems. examines case-study research, its
development, and its characteristics. the author has recently started a
project which uses multi-site case studies to examine 6th-formers' capacity
for independent library-based work. uses this as a framework to discuss
questions to be considered by those contemplating this sort of research.
considers 3 main sources of information (interviews, documents, and
observation); their integration into case records; and the use of narration,
vignette, and analysis as reporting methods. points out that it is crucial to
find forms of presentation conducive to a critical reaction from the reader.

comments on the report by the library school's working party on a programme
for library research. approves the programme's stress on research
qualifications for the library school staff. the programme is the 1st attempt
at a survey and analysis of library research in sweden and rightly stresses
the need for data on the different attitudes to and use of libraries by the
arts and the sciences. but it neglects an obvious research area-cooperation
between different types of library for efficient use of scarce resources. in a
time of economic difficulties it becomes necessary to carry out research which
may provide arguments vis-a-vis the grant giving authorities for
'non-quantifiable income' or service improvements. the emphasis in the
programme will at 1st rightly be on user studies and studies aimed at
improving services.

a look at information recurrence and a comparative analysis of scientific
information and other activities in the scientific communication framework are
brought to bear on a verification of the concept of information science. this
is proved to be scientific and more selective in information service than
library, translation, or publishing activities. it differs from research and
development by its goals and functions. argues that information tasks should
be distributed among the information units and research or design divisions of
a given enterprise or office.

examines the concept of 'information' as the term in 'information design'
still largely taken for granted and proposes an approach from information
science which can offer a useful theoretical foundation for information design

employed by practitioners in information work, those who deal with texts from
the point of view of information retrieval and who act as intermediaries
between generators and users of information. the professional practice of this
group of intermediaries in information communication has, it is argued, some
useful insights for that of the other group-information designers.

processes of a secure and reliable pedagogy. the work is intended for library

profession; and the tendency for librarianship and information work to come

overall manpower planning both for the educational and professional planning
of services.

the professional training of librarians has not improved in italy during the
last 50 years. university reform has completely ignored the problem of library
organisation in respect of research and teaching. librarians should take
degree courses in the specific disciplines of the cultural areas served by the
libraries in which they intend to work. professional preparation cannot be
considered complete without adequate practical experience. librarians lacking
the capacity to organise a library on traditional lines will not profit much
from the assistance of advanced technology. the university should rationalise
its own libraries and concentrate its internal services at all levels on
satisfying the requests of all potential readers.

comments on the report of the boras library high school, sweden for 1979-80.
the changing forms of the education for librarianship and the question of an
education for tutor librarians are discussed. when reviewing the capacity of
the school it is clear that it has not responded well to the changing labour
market, sometimes producing over-, sometimes undercapacity. criticises the
plans for several shorter training courses as they might reduce interest in
the 2-year librarianship course. discusses also whether the education for
librarianship should be general with specialisation after a foundation course,
as the student representatives want, or whether specialised courses should be
available earlier, and argues for more librarians with special knowledge of
administration, information work, and outreach activities, which cannot be
acquired through costly in-service training.

reply to an article in open 12 (9) sept 80, 397-404 (see 81/1865) in which
professional education for the diploma in academic librarianship in the
netherlands was criticised for the lack of a practical base. however, students
following the course in academic librarianship at the p.a. tiele school of
librianship in the hague receive lectures from practising academic librarians
and the syllabus is reviewed annually in consultation with students and with
staff from academic libraries. in addition the variety of posts in academic
libraries open to students completing the course makes it impractical to suit
the syllabus to a single type of library. it is also clear that too little is
known about the course by practising librarians.

traditional library activities for established user groups are still the norm
in swedish libraries, and immigrant services are carried out as humanitarian
aid with consequent low status. if demand for immigrant literature were
treated like that for cook books or stamp catalogues a less emotional attitude
would be achieved. libraries must help immigrants to retain their mother
tongue as well as to learn swedish. there are governmental guidelines on
stocking of immigrant literature and channels of supply are available, but
coordination of acquisition and cataloguing is needed. more contact with
immigrant organisations and better education of librarians are necessary. what
has already been done is largely due to the work of the swedish library
association's working party on immigrant and minority questions.

man abstracts experience into symbols and uses them to redirect his energies
in manipulating the real world. the organisational environments thus
abstracted change so rapidly that man has difficulty in describing them.
abstractions of organisations (such as libraries) should not be mistaken as
having a reality. statements made on the purpose and goals of organisations
are at best like hypotheses which are temporary descriptions of an environment
that must be testable to be of value. the mark of a healthy organisation rests
on the fervour with which it tests goals.

paper presented by the papua new guinea minister for state on the occasion of
the opening of the extension to adcol library, 15 oct 80. the primary function
of the library is to provide information for and to educate its
users-libraries are therefore sources of information and centres of learning
and education, and the success or failure of a library to provide these
services depends largely on the quality of the librarians who run it.
libraries are essential services to national development.

the 1st international conference of american states, held in washington in
1889-90 made provisions for the creation of a latin american library to be
established in washington. the library, known as the columbus memorial library
(biblioteca conmemorativa de colon) was formed by contributions of printed
material from all the member states and is one of the most outstanding
libraries in the us of books relating to the iberoamerican countries,
specialising in historical, geographical and literary works, maps, manuscripts
and official documents. while the primary purpose of the columbus memorial
library is to serve the pan american union and organization of american states
by preparing material in order to help solve their political, economic and
cultural problems, the columbus memorial library also has become a centre for
research and information, besides attending to the general public. further
more, it keeps in close contact with the libraries of central and south

interview with n. moore, project officer in charge of public library research
at the british library. defines research as theoretical research, which
provides general background information on libraries and their users, and
research which seeks to solve specific problems and help librarians provide
better services. public libraries are mainly interested in the latter. recent
research has begun to look at why people use public libraries and the results
are being used to improve services. the british library supports research
investigating resource distribution, cooperation and staff organisation in
public libraries and examining the role of public libraries in relation to
further education. this research is as far as possible carried out by
practising librarians, often in conjunction with the library schools. the
british library also finances research centres, which initiate research, build
up collections of resource material and advise researchers. an advisory comm
ittee on public library research helps the british library coordinate research.

the views expressed in an interview with frans stein in bibliotheek en
samenleving 8 (11) nov 80, 311-316 (see 81/3084), by frans van de roer, head
of the library section at the dutch ministry of culture, recreation and social
services represent a serious threat to the future of public libraries in the
netherlands. in spite of government assurances that access to information
should be available to all sections of the public, van de roer is clearly in
favour of increasing membership charges for public libraries in an effort to
reduce government spending. librarians must convince the authorities that
public library services should be regarded as part of a national information
policy and not as part of the local socio-cultural services.

the population of manchester expanded rapidly in the years following world war

not available, so the city librarian suggested a travelling library on the
lines of those already in use in the usa and the uk's 1st mobile library took
to the streets of manchester in july 1931. the service was well-used and
expanded, was suspended during world war ii, and was resumed in 1948. it is
now an integral part of the city's library service, serving areas unable to
support a branch library, those unable to visit a branch library, and areas

the resultant reduction in library hours generated much adverse publicity and
it was feared that future budget allocations would be inadequate. the library
advisory committee were encouraged to play a more visible role in bringing the
library's problems to the attention of the university administration. the

the formation of the special libraries section of the nederlandse vereniging

association of librarians, documentalists and information scientists) in the
netherlands in 1941 was due largely to the efforts of dr. l.j. van der wolk,
librarian of the nitrogen products division of the state mines in limburg. at
van der wolk's suggestion, membership of the section was originally restricted
to staff of commercial and industrial libraries. the first committee meeting
of the section was held in the state mines central laboratory at geleen on 17
sept 41 and the 1st meeting of members on 29 oct following in the park hotel,

in the netherlands the provision of library services in hospitals with less
than 100 beds is seriously inadequate. a survey of smaller hospitals in the us
in 1975 showed that 1/3 of hospitals surveyed had some form of library. the
provision of library services in dutch hospitals is hindered by inadequate
bookfunds, staff and accommodation. furthermore, in the smaller hospitals
doctors are too busy with routine work to use library services. smaller
hospitals could provide medical 'core' libraries of basic textbooks and
periodicals at minimal cost. such a medical core library was formed in 1973 at
the princess irene hospital in almelo and by 1979 the library contained 266
books and 6 periodical titles.

contribution to an issue devoted to library services for the disabled.
discusses the significance of the international year of the disabled in a
present and future library context. libraries must assist handicapped people
to take part in the social and cultural life of the community on equal terms
with everyone else, but this means that they must have equal access to the
information and expressive human experience caught by the printed word. a
total or partial reading handicap will hinder this access. to the library
falls the task of breaking down the barriers which prevent those with a
reading handicap from gaining access to the message contained by words in
print.

librarians at us colleges and universities sponsoring elderhostel (a programme
for adults aged over 60, offered on many campuses) for at least 2 years during
1977-79. the 197 replies containing usable data indicated that the librarians
disagreed with stereotypic statements concerning older adults; contact with
older adult relatives was not a significant factor in the librarians'
responses to the statements; implementing library programmes for older adults
was a significant factor in librarians' agreement with suggested library
services for older adults, while planning programmes for them was less
significant and volunteer community work was not a significant factor; and
librarians felt that age is not necessarily a debilitative factor with regard
to learning and motivation to learn.

the library services to immigrants in denmark are governed by the general rule
of equal access to library services. for practical reasons, this means that
part of the service must be centralised, viz. selection, acquisition and
preparation of the material. gentofte public library has since 1970 had a
central collection of immigrant literature available to other libraries. the
choice of material must be made in consultation with people knowledgeable
about the groups and their conditions in the new country. the selection must
also reflect the need, not only for fictional, but also for informative
literature both about the homeland and the adopted country. more audio-visual
material and a better classification system are necessary. the efforts of the
local library catering for very small groups of immigrants must, apart from
collections of reference works and classics, be concentrated on contact work
and cultural arrangements.

children attend the 3 local community schools. there is no library service at
present in the buin area, but the buin provincial high school library serves
both as a school and public library. a proper public library should be built
in the town centre, run independently of the school library, and community
information centres or mobile services should operate in each area, the former
staffed by a librarian and a teacher. school dropouts (the area has many)

the bradford distribution differs from most probability distributions in that
it is concerned with the rank-order s of the elements in terms of their
productivity (from highest down to lowest) rather than with the numerical
values n of the element's productivity. the defining relationship is that s is
exponentially related to g, the cumulative production of the elements of
rank-order s or less. this implies a zipf-like relationship between mean
productivity and rank-order, which is analogous to the weber-fechner law of
psychophysics. a variational specification of the distribution is given, and
it is pointed out that the relationship between the construction of the
bradford and that of the usual distributions is roughly analogous to the

in 1976 a new us copyright law was signed that included the creation of the
american television and radio archives, and which, through deposits under the
copyright law, gifts and exchanges, and limited off-air taping provides for
the retention of programmes of present or potential public or cultural
interest, historical significance or cognitive value, and all other programmes
worthy of preservation. the archive is scheduled to open in 1981, as the
immediate responsibility of the library of congress motion picture,
broadcasting, and recorded sound division. reviews the library of congress'

the increasing critical acclaim given to photographs has resulted in their
being exhibited in museums as a new art form, but this brings legal problems
for the museum. subjects may claim invasion of privacy, and photographers may
complain of a violation of copyright. careful sifting of legal principles
involved with photographic matters and adherence to regulated procedures
reduces the potential liability for vexations claims to manageable
proportions. outlines what the registrar can do by reviewing the photographs
and accompanying documents to minimise the museum's exposure to the hazards of
invasion of privacy.

libraries' fascination with video is resulting in some alarming trends. media
collections are being unduly influenced in favour of public films-on-video,
jeopardising the concept of collection-building for the entire population;
media formats are being confused-because feature films are the main content of
home video, many think that the terms film, videotape, and videodisc are
interchangeable; and there is the manipulation of libraries and information by
the video entrepreneurs who have invested millions in the new format and
nothing in the concept of equal access to all information. the new video
technologies do have great potential, but it is not financially realisable or
practicable for libraries. libraries must maintain their high standards and
continue to collect all media.

contribution to an issue devoted to library services for the disabled. video
technology has meant something of a revolution to those born deaf, since their
own, sign, language can now be preserved on video films, and thus, in a sense,
'put into print'. describes work carried out at the county library in
vasteras, sponsored by the national cultural council, sweden, to produce video
films for the deaf. projects so far include recordings of ibsen's 'a doll's
house', books, and cinderella. some time in the future, when vcrs have become
standard technical aids for the deaf, it should be as natural for the
libraries to lend videograms to the deaf as it is for them to lend talking
books to the blind.

an account of the founding of the british institute of recorded sound and its
national sound archive, its development, and its activities. its brief was to
establish a fully comprehensive archive, international in scope, though with a
special responsibility for preserving uk material, covering all aspects of
knowledge and experience. it records radio programmes, poetry readings, and
theatre productions; receives 1,000 commercial gramophone records monthly;
contains the british library of wildlife sounds (blows); has
ethnomusicological recordings from throughout the world; and has a library of
written matter. it organises lectures and provides a free public listening
service. in spring 80, computerisation of the index was begun and it is hoped
that a catalogue will be produced.

foreign economic literature available in bulgarian libraries is usually
classified as non-marxist publications issued before 1900. between 1900-45
only a few marxist publications can be traced. after world war ii, however,
the share of economic literature based on marxism increased rapidly. the cyril
and methodius national library has the largest collection of foreign economic
literature in the country consisting mainly of reference material. the main
topic at the university of sofia library is economic history and some unique
publications can be found there, for example from the early days of the soviet
union. economic theory is represented above all at the library of the
bulgarian academy of sciences. economic colleges in varna and sviscov cater
for the needs of their students. there are also some specialised collections
and catalogues at the bulgarian chamber of commerce and the central
agricultural library, established some time ag o. the majority of foreign
economic literature is in russian, english, german and french. advocates the
increased exploitation of all the national resources listed above.

evidence is presented to demonstrate that the tendency for increased
collaboration in science publishing does not proceed without limit. there
appears to be a maximum extent of collaboration, related to the optimum size
of a research unit. empirical corrections to allow for the sociological
differences between various science subjects enable a generalised curve to be
generated which appears to be a feature of research groups' dynamics. the
study incorporates publication data from one research division over the last
fifty years, with the time-independence of the relationship established by
interpolation with similar data for 13 other new zealand research divisions
for the period 1970 to 1977.

examines 4 historical accounts of the quantum mechanics problem in physics.
the purpose is to describe the literature used by the histories quantitatively
using frequency of data of publication. additionally, 1 of the histories was
tested against the other 3 to determine differences. a moments test and a t
test were employed. the results indicated the literature of quantum mechanics,
when plotted as a function of frequency of publication date is non-normal,
negatively skewed, and is platykurtic. the test for difference between the one
history and the cumulative histories was non-significant. interpretations of
the results are discussed.

and the pattern of distribution of serial and periodical articles. both
parameters are shown to vary with time and problem. no significant differences
are identified in the subject orientation of publications grouped according to
the bradford 3-zone model. suggests that to develop reference/information
collections in specific subject areas, all published sources should be
separated into 2 broad categories-core publications with respect to a given
theme and the rest. describes a method for identifying core publications.

in 3 biomedical research institutions, there is no indication of a single
laboratory size at which the number of publications per scientist is maximal
or minimal. in a scattergram of the number of publications of a laboratory
against laboratory size, the horizontal coordinate measures the number of
scientists in a laboratory, the vertical axis measures the number of
publications from the laboratory (counting each publication once regardless of
the number of authors), and each laboratory is represented by one point.
scattergrams for the rockefeller university (new york), the national institute
for medical research (london), and the national cancer institute (bethesda)
are each described well by a straight line through the origin. the slopes of
the lines for the three institutions are not significantly different. in these
laboratories, ranging in size from 1 to 46 scientists, one additional
scientist  increases the expected annual number of publications of a
laboratory by approximately 1.1, regardless of the size of the laboratory.

the freie universitat berlin (berlin university) in west berlin was taken as
an example for analysis and suggestions concerning the university library's
task of forming a library system. success in this task does not depend on the
laws governing the library but is affected by the existing structure of the
competent university bodies. the university library is required by law to
coordinate, supervise and advise the department libraries. in order to carry
out this task the system planning department must be completely integrated
into the university internal information stream, it must be able to introduce
initiatives into the advisory and decision-making procedures of the university
and follow these up. this interdependent work was studied in detail at the
berlin university. weak points in the system were analysed and suggestions for
reducing prejud icial effects were made. this study should give rise to
internal discussion at the university concerned and may also be of interest to
other external libraries of similar structure.

the japan medical library association is the most powerful association of
special libraries in japan. it owes much for its development to the usa and
europe, and as such has virtually no contact with medical libraries in asian,
and particularly southeast asian countries. whilst the southeast asian medical
information center (seamic) held its 1st workshop in tokyo in 1973, the
problem of the variety and complexity of the region is a barrier to the
establishment of a network of libraries in southeast asia. only by removing
these barriers and establishing strong regional cooperation, can information
be exchanged freely, which will be a sure step in the development of medical
information.

although spiraling costs and reduced budgets require that small academic
libraries form clusters to share resources and services, consortia and library
networks so far have taken only tentative or shallow steps in this direction.
real and meaningful steps can and must be taken to develop joint acquisition
policies, effective and timely interlibrary loan procedures, cooperative
reference services, and division of responsibility for periodicals. resource
utilisation in the areas of technical processes, staff, and equipment can be
improved, and librarians need to adopt an attitude of interdependency and
shared mutual responsibility. clusters of 5 to 10 libraries within a limited
geographic proximity offer a feasible framework with an individual in each
committed to seek out, develop, and maintain cooperative programmes. report

following the recommendations of a working party of library representatives
from the koninklijke nederlandse academie van wetenschappen (royal dutch
academy of sciences) and the technical university of delft in the netherlands
in 1979 for closer cooperation between the 2 libraries, a formal cooperative
agreement was made in 1980. regular meetings of staff from both libraries are
now held to discuss possible areas of cooperation. in both libraries
consideration of the partner's holdings is taken into account before the
purchase of new books, periodicals and reports. the libraries further
cooperate closely in interlibrary lending and the provision of computerised
information retrieval services. in addition both libraries have agreed with
the european space agency international retrieval services to act as a back-up

discusses why there are so many problems with the development of new services
and products (by both commercial and non-profit vendors of automation) to meet
the needs of libraries; why after years of planning and preparation, whole
sub-systems do not function or perform at unacceptable levels or prices; and
why, in the continuing exchange between regional library networks and national
companies and agencies, there are so few achievements in cooperation, joint
development and funding, and close working relationships. vendors must stop
using professional marketers in planning developments; they must communicate
directly with libraries instead. they should also cooperate amongst themselves

contribution to a finnish issue. the metropolitan area consisting of helsinki,
espoo, vantaa, and kauniainen cities has provided a framework for cooperative
library automation. the city libraries are aiming at establishing joint data
systems and data bases, while maintaining their independence as local
government units. the automated circulation control and book file updating
systems are already operational; the cataloguing system will be started once a
national decision regarding centralised library services has been made; and
the acquisitions system development work was due to commence in spring 81.

an analysis (based loosely on the author's recent experiences) of the
hardware, software and information sources available to librarians considering
adding a microcomputer to their retrieval and administrative tools. to reduce
development time and cost, library procedures should be modified to match
available software where possible, rather than commissioning new software.

.I 1671
.W
reviews myths surrounding the subject of personnel administration, and
concludes that if administration is to be successful, certain fundamental
truths must be observed' (1) people need to be given reasons; (2) praise
should be public, but criticism always private; (3) promises must be kept and
threats enforced, or neither should be made; fairness, impartiality, and above
all, consistency are vital; and (5) when policy is unjust, the personnel
administrator must fight for people.

.I 1672
.W
decries the changes which are taking place in librarianship, with reduced
funds, reduced staffing and a resultant onus on the librarian to perform
multiple roles, often distinct from librarianship, to the point where typing
skills may be demanded of a job applicant.

a summary of orlando (florida) public library's 1980 work benefits survey of
public libraries with annual budgets of at least $1 million. 76 libraries
throughout the usa gave details of benefits available to full-time
professional staff concerning hours of work, paid holidays, leave, sick leave,
death leave, retirement, health insurance, life insurance, parking, and
additional benefits. the survey is carried out annually.

expectancy theories of employee motivation have been the focus of much
empirical research and theoretical writing. little attention has been given,
however, to its practical application in the workplace. suggests that this may
be because the model, as usually discussed, is highly complex and difficult to
understand. translates expectancy theory into a form that is both
understandable and usable by library administrators.

contribution to an issue devoted to library services for the disabled. in 1975
the norwegian ministry of social affairs issued guidelines for building design
to accommodate wheelchair users, giving standard dimensions for doors, lifts,
toilets and other building features. also included were instructions on the
use of symbols to mark, for example, entrances and paths. in 1976 the
norwegian ministry of labour and local government issued new rules to
supplement the official building regulations of 1969. the basic requirement is
that public buildings shall be accessible to the blind and other disabled
persons. summarises the requirements of these regulations.

a staged building programme has been necessary to meet the growth in demand on
the blld and to house its increased stock. the urquhart building, the site's
main building, is designed for easy access to high-use stock, fast flow of
material, and future flexibility. the ground floor receives and despatches
post, and mechanical handling equipment moves request forms and library
materials to the processing and records area on the 1st floor and the 6
further storeys that house stock. there are large areas for access and
machinery on the storage floors. the shelving for both hard-copy and
microforms was specially designed. mechanical handling systems include
conveyors in the packing areas, automatic vertical elevators, and mobile
containers to carry request forms between request processing and storage
areas. other buildings on the site will be used for future stock expansion.

the library should be an integral part of the fabric of the community, and in
canada, despite a tightening of the money supply, public libraries continue to
provide community services, with a change in outlook from libraries as book
repositories to libraries as total information sources. describes some
canadian library services offering a range of information and activities from
yoga classes to motorcycle clubs. if libraries fail to take the initiative in
providing access to information, others will assume that role.

describes the present functions of governmental libraries which gives them
independence, and outlines a possible governmental information system whose
functions should be reception, adaptation, concentration, storage, combination

to achieve good results, an interactive process between the user and the
information officer has to take place. conditions for the effectiveness of

assessment of the act with particular reference to its implications for
archivists, suggesting that whilst the act is working, it releases some of the
information agencies would like to withhold and witholds some information that
requesters would like released. overall, it probably strikes a balance. a
continuing challenge in the 1980s is the statement of records by archivists so
that everyone-agencies, researchers, lawyers, and even judges-will understand
it.

since sept 75, the world intellectual property organization (wipo) has
organised, for developing countries, a free state-of-the-art search programme
based on the use of patent documents as a vehicle for the transfer of
technology. it started following an agreement of cooperation with the austrian
government and has recently been augmented by agreements with west germany,
the ussr, sweden, switzerland, and the european patent office. by the end of
june 80, 839 requests had been received, of which 637 had been finalised. the
volume of requests is steadily growing. discusses the many differing features
of patent documents and the types of search available in the programme.

this publication is designed to disseminate information concerning activity in
the us patent system, in particular, this report reveals the identities of
more than 5,000 corporations and other organisations active in us patenting,
and traces the level and timing of their respective activity. this publication
identifies those organisations which have been 'patent active', with 10 or
more patents to their credit in the last 12 years. it also ranks those patent
recipients, i.e. national and international corporations, universities,
government agencies, and other organisations, in terms of total 12-year patent

discusses some of the problems which the information scientist faces when
having to select a particular social science research strategy. the
established measurement approach is disfavoured as it is incompatible with the
actual social and psychological conditions under which data are collected.
qualitative methods may also be biased by social and psychological constrains
inherent in their use. this is illustrated by reviewing the case of the
research interview. 2 possibilities are outlined which help to increase the
adequacy of data collection.

.I 1710
.W
outlines the reasons for the choice of 'structured observation' as a research
method, describes the training process and the development of the

after outlining the historic development of the libraries of statistical
offices and considering them one of the earliest types of specialised library,
the result of a comprehensive statistical survey is presented which was
conducted for the 1st time on a world-wide basis at the libraries of national
statistical offices. the analysis of the results is followed by conclusions
with regard to a further encouragement of the cooperation between libraries
with a view to creating a world-wide documentation retrieval. in the light of
these activities, as for instance in the field of atomic research, such a
consideration can in no way be regarded as an illusion. this suggestion
represents at the same time a partial programme for further work to be
performed by the relevant ifla section.

.I 1712
.W
statistical information is a vital national resource, and a more comprehensive
effort needs to be made to review and control us federal statistical policy.
the federal government collects statistical information for regulation,
programme operation, policy analysis and information programmes. statistical
policy must be effectively incorporated into legislative proposals and
regulatory actions, with a statistical office remaining separate from other
aspects of information policy. the government should take full advantage of
computer and communications technology in its dissemination and use of
statistical data, and private firms should engage in any and all analysis
appropriate for the markets being served. federal government should not
encroach upon activities which properly belong in the private sector.

increased us governmental complexity and growing dissatisfaction with
government are 2 major developments of contemporary us society. responses to
these developments have included the establishment of information-providing
and complaint-handling agencies in state government. examination of these
state agencies indicates considerable variation in reasons for establishment,
administrative location, funding, and scope of responsibilities. summarises a
number of these differences and considers the importance of the agencies for
state government.

(contribution to a debate on libraries and community information.) argues
strongly that libraries have a role to play in community information, but that
it is very limited or demands special skills, a less rigid and passive
attitude to information, and a less information-oriented approach to people.

.I 1717
.W
(contribution to a debate on libraries and community information.) librarians
make the mistake of seeing community information as being just another type of
information, and they fall for some very basic fallacies: (1) the assumption
that objective information is the only valuable information; (2) that if a
little information is good then a lot must be better; (3) that objective
information can be transmitted out of context; (4) that information is only
acquired through formal information systems; (5) that information is relevant
to all everyday needs, with an information solution to problems; (6) that
information not now available can be made available; and (7) that functional
units of information systems correspond to the functional units of the user.

.I 1718
.W
discusses information dispensing, seen as one category of information and
referral systems. defines the theoretical concepts behind this kind of i&r and
presents an example of how information dispensing can be used.

.I 1719
.W
examines the applicability of an ombudsman function within a conventional
information and referral structure. defines and reviews the historical
development of the ombudsman concept, and interfaces this concept with the
realities of i&r functions, funding and client needs.

.I 1720
.W
defines the role of the social broker and identifies it as a role particularly
suited for the bsw graduate working in an information and retrieval setting.
the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to perform the brokerage role
are presented. in addition, suggests a framework to assist the social broker
accomplishing tasks of linking clients to needed tasks.

.I 1721
.W
discusses some historical aspects which have influenced information and
referral (i&r) centres on a contemporary basis. indicates how information and
referral fits in with the human services delivery systems and offers some
classifications of the various kinds of i&r services operating today. casework
skills are indicated as playing an integral part in the information and
referral services and their importance in these various classifications.
discusses the 80s with emphasis on how social workers and librarians will be
working together.

.I 1722
.W
describes and advocates a permanent, free-standing, generic information and
referral state system which would provide both centralised data collection and
dissemination, and decentralised service delivery. contends that such a system
would decrease cost while improving effectiveness.

.I 1723
.W
60 public libraries throughout the usa are offering information and referral
services in varying degrees from timid to ambitious, 80% using library budgets
for support. these libraries realise the importance of close ties with social
service agencies, the necessity of publicity, and the imperative need to
evaluate present i&r functions.

.I 1724
.W
methods of networking for i&r have become a major source of debate. presents
details of the portland, oregon, networking model. some general questions
concerning personal relationships and teamwork are raised in the conclusions.

.I 1725
.W
analyses the development and expansion of information and referral services as
both a manifestation of and response to the services phenomena of
post-industrial society. the importance of services and information epitomised
by i&r services is cited as distinguishing post-industrial from earlier
societies. thus, information mechanisms such as i&r services are necessary to
assist individuals in identifying and evaluating services appropriate to their
needs and circumstances.

.I 1726
.W
examines marketing strategy and reviews the effectiveness of social service
advertising. describes and evaluates a marketing campaign for an i&r service,
concluding that paid advertising was cost effective in increasing utilisation
of the i&r.

.I 1727
.W
presents a model of an information communication system in education
consisting of 2 subsystems' (a) the subsystem of didactic information
processing and the results of the national and international research work in
the area of education; and (b) the subsystem of numerical data (data banks) as
a national information system for managing staff in education, which
specifically provides statistical data concerning the progress of this
activity. a description of the information flow within the 2 subsystems is
made and several evaluation criteria of the overall system efficiency are
given.

based on information provided primarily by 2 existing state-based information
services, this handbook presents a clear, practical look at possible
activities, procedures, and requirements of search services for educators.
descriptions of the 2 services that serve as models, oklahoma's sooner
exchange for educational knowledge (seek) and texas' coordinating information
for texas educators (cite), are followed by detailed discussions of the
products offered by search services and how resources are built for the
services. report not available from ntis.

.I 1729
.W
describes an investigation into scientists' information needs, based on
information services provided by the far eastern scientific centre, ussr.
stresses the importance of analysing user feedback; improved subscription
lists to foreign periodicals; and identification of important materials not
covered by abstract journals. the results of a questionnaire confirmed the
centre's choice of information services and lead to several recommendations
aimed at raising the efficiency of the services.

.I 1730
.W
discusses organisational and methodological aspects of the interaction between
an industry association's scientific and technical information (sti) unit and
the relevant branch and regional sti centres. describes the information
collection, processing, storage, and dissemination activities of these
regional centres. indicates drawbacks in the association/regional centre
relationship and suggests remedies.

.I 1731
.W
considers proposals (made with regard to the work experience of scientific and
technical information (sti) centres in russia) which, when implemented, will
improve the effectiveness of the interaction and operation of disciplinary and
regional information centres throughout the ussr. documents must be prepared,
laying down the interaction between these nodes of the soviet sti network.

.I 1732
.W
the information productivity of a scientist depends upon the number and
frequency of contacts with colleagues and time spent on such contacts. more
often, a scientist establishes contacts with those who pay more attention to
the scientific and technical literature. the probability of contacts decreases
with increasing distance between scientists. suggests using such contacts to
improve information services to the scientists.

.I 1733
.W
demonstrates the fundamental and practical difficulties which are opposed to
the transfer of technology. the 2nd part concerns the problem of transferring
technological/scientific results of government-supported research to industry,
so that it can be exploited industrially and commercially.

.I 1734
.W
links between past and present literature can properly illustrate the
informative value of previous scientific works and put into evidence the
dynamic progress of science. the diffusion theory developed by the author for
information dissemination makes possible the theoretical deduction of the
distribution of citations of earlier papers and establishes their information
values.

.I 1735
.W
analyses the organisation of an information service for specialist

.I 1739
.W
shows how an analysis of parallel scientific journals in various countries can
indicate the dynamics of the spread of scientific instruments and methods, the
level of scientific achievement, and the structure of science in those
countries. uses this method to study the dynamics of the spread of infrared
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry in the uk,
usa, france, and west germany during 1960-77. articles in 2journal of organic
chemistry1 and 2journal of agricultural and food chemistry1 are compared to
evaluate the speed of spectroscopic methods transfer from fundamental to
applied science and the ratio of methods used in the latter discipline.

.I 1740

in response to the increase in the number of drug questions being referred by
public librarians, the information services department of the library of the
health sciences, university of illinois at the medical center, chicago,
planned a workshop, presented in nov 78. the objectives were to advise public
librarians in the reference interviewing process for drug questions from

analyses the public information policies of the netherlands central government
and the city of amsterdam using the 'information paradigm' for the analysis of
organisations and galbraith's 'information model' for the design of
organisations. the common characteristic of these 2 theories is the hypothesis
that there is a direct relation between information structure and organisation
structure. from this point of view, similarities and differences between the 2
policies are indicated, together with their implications for informational
relations between different levels of government. general conclusions are
drawn.

the office of discoveries and inventions is the supreme body governing patent
information, which is, however, an integral part of the scientific and
technical information network. the central library of patent literature in
prague holds the central stock of patent information in czechoslovakia in
conjunction with special libraries and information centres. briefly reviews
the history of patent information work, which is 15 years old in
czechoslovakia. the 1st methodology was worked out in 1964 and the most recent
legislative document has come into force on april 1st, 1975. the network of
regional centres of patent literature consists of 13 state scientific,
technical and regional libraries. particular attention is paid to patent
materials from the comecon countries but some patent sources are available
from the industrialised capitalist countries.

debates on the effects of information technologies are usually limited to 3
subjects' computers, privacy, and job-killing. the reality is far more
complex. numerous information technologies have come into existence and tend
to combine or merge with each other, causing 3 classes of social effects'
rationalisation of the labour process(es) involved; modellification
(planning/regulating/controlling) of the persons/things/procedures modelled by
data and software; and social, political, and economic aims superseding the
information system's original purpose. shows in theory how this can be
explained and generalised to all information technologies and discusses in
practical terms how to avoid negative and promote positive consequences.

points out that the only appearance of the word 'library' in towards open
government: 1, the general report of new zealand's committee on official
information, chaired by sir alan danks, is in an appended list of those who
made submissions; the document was released on the friday of a holiday weekend
(5 feb 81); copies were not sent to depository libraries for over a month; and
the limited stocks were soon sold out. the new zealand library association
standing executive committee has said that the commission has not really
tackled its term of reference concerning 'the extent to which official
information can be made readily available to the public', the key area of
library concern. release of official documents to the news media does not
constitute public availability of information; speedy access in libraries
(without hold-ups for time-consuming cataloguing and classifying), does.

identifies the development stages of information activity as issue,
notification, service, and provision of information. emphasises the necessity
of switching information organs from information service to information
provision as the most effective and active way of informing users. such a

the author's invention of virtual space is the basis of a research programme
to study the use in teleconferencing of the same modes of communication which
work well in face-to-face communication. it can be used to create at each site
of a teleconference the essential spatial relationships that would occur if
all the participants were at each site. each participant is surrounded by a
group of surrogate units, one unit per other participant and each unit
comprising camera, microphone, visual display, and speaker. the relative

the motivation for the protection of personal data is examined. it is found to
be of genuine human value. reasons for its importance in developing societies
are suggested. in spite of the low frequency of abuses, regulations are
necessary and the form they should take is considered. the desirability of
basing them on internationally-acceptable standards rather than on national
laws is stressed, though the need for the latter is accepted. the practicable
possibility of international agreement is considered.

the south australian land information system comprises a series of separate
but integrated sub-systems of varying degrees of automation and encompassing
land and property evaluation, land taxing, water and sewerage rating, land
ownership and tenure, mapping, and cadastral coordination. major current
developments are on-line systems for land ownership and tenure (lots) and
coordination of allotments (clots). longer term developments relate mainly to
the closer integration of these 2 and the extension of lots towards an
automated registration, indexing and enquiries system (aries), leading
ultimately to a computerised land title.

to collect information relevant to the improvement of secondary services, an
analysis of 59,000 citations in the social sciences was conducted-11,000 taken
from 300 monographs, and 48,000 from 140 serials, including 47 highly cited
titles and 47 taken at random. large differences were apparent between
analyses of referenes taken from serials and those from monographs, and
smaller differences between analyses of references from highly cited and
randomly chosen serials. there were also great differences between subjects;
most of these differenes have implications for the planning of secondary
services. the results imply that secondary services in the social sciences are
deficient in the range of forms of material they cover, in the number and
possibly the selection of serials covered, in the subject spread of material
of possible relevance, and probably also of foreign language material and
material published in many other countries.

library administrators, confronted with the realities of managing with less,
should consider privatisation as a cost-cutting arrangement for the delivery
of library services. management decision making which separates the roles of
provider and producer offers the potential for reducing costs through
competitive bidding by private firms offering to produce library services.
examines the privatisation arrangement, reviews its advantages and
disadvantages, and its application to 3 library operations' reference
services, security, and cataloguing.

automated periodicals-control system (pekos), which forms part of the
integrated circulation system developed at the eth-bibliothek, zurich. at
present pekos controls the 8,000 current periodicals until storage of
completed volumes; it will eventually be extended to the entire periodicals
holdings. explains how access to the data files can be obtained by either

in minnesota and later sold to the illinois north suburban library system,
which serves a much larger clientele and could thus provide economies of scale
based on high-volume borrowing and large collections.

.W
contribution to the lita (american library association. library and
information technology association) institute. librarians should be aware of
the rapid progress being made toward integrated systems and make the
acquisitions automation decision in that light. contrasts the mid-60s and
early 80s in terms of technology and library needs. in the mid-60s, emphasis
was on ordering, and technology was limiting both in terms of costs and
capabilities. at the beginning of the 80s libraries have numerous acquisitions
available, including turnkey systems from some circulation system vendors and
the acquisitions subsystems of the bibliographic utilities. it is unlikely
that a single source will offer a library the most suitable features for each
function, and the problem becomes one of integrating systems from several
sources.

.I 1825
.W
contribution to the lita (american library association. library and
information technology association) institute. a local approach to the
automation of acquisitions processes was, until comparatively recently, the
only alternative available. guidelines for the design process are well
documented; costs are not. investigates pitfalls to a local approach and lists
alternatives. explores trends such as the increasing importance of interface
with national or other local systems, and the greater demands for managerial
data. suggests that a less rigid, traditional approach towards automating
acquisitions functions might be more effective, and that a thorough
investigation of available alternatives should precede a decision to adopt or
maintain a totally local approach.

contribution to the lita (american library association. library and
information technology association) institute. examines non-profit
bibliographic networks to assess why they offer, or plan to offer acquisitions
services, what major contributions they can make, and the advantages and
disadvantages of network acquisitions systems for individual libraries.
networks can contribute significantly because cataloguing and acquisitions
functions are complementary, and the networks can provide both acquisitions
and in-process control over materials, thus allowing a library to operate more
efficiently with improved internal controls. as a network system will display
member holdings, cooperative acquisitions and interlibrary loan will also be
facilitated.

brookes' model, based on traditional bradford's approach, as a quantification
method, has some loopholes which can be overcome by ranking journals
considering both productivity and subscription cost. this paper reports such a
study. the major findings are 1) this method is a further improvement and
rationalisation of brookes' method and traditional bradford's approach. 2)
there is a steady decrease in the value of rupee in terms of yield of relevant
papers and thus journal acquisition reaches the point of diminishing returns
at a certain stage. 3) there is a significant difference in the 2 ranked
lists.

edited version of a paper given to the ifla section on interlending at the
ifla general conference, manila, the philippines, aug 80. surveys interlending
in the countries which comprise the consortium of national libraries and
documentation centres, south-east asia-indonesia, malaysia, the philippines,
singapore and thailand. a questionnaire survey revealed that the volume of
interlending varied greatly between these countries and was generally low.
many more interlibrary loan requests were sent abroad than were received. only
a few libraries had telephone and telex links, but many had reprographic
equipment. requests were sent mainly to subject specialist libraries, and
union catalogues and central collections were less used. charges were minimal.
stresses the importance of maintaining national and international statistics.
this is 1 function of national interlending centres, which should be
established as independent units in all coun tries.

revised version of a paper presented at the international seminar on national
document provision, boston spa, 22-24 sept 80. recent us developments have
favoured decentralised networks rather than centralised resource libraries. us
libraries lack central planning and funding, and progress depends on
individual library initiatives. in the last 10 years this has resulted in
oclc, rlg, wln and 20 regional networks. describes the 3 major computer
computer utilities. these computer networks would be complemented not
duplicated by central resource libraries; with the national periodicals center
effectively shelved, the center for research libraries could assume a more
dynamic role. commercial vendors are often overlooked, but are an important
element in document delivery systems. they are completely outside conventional
library systems, and might cream off the profitable end of the document supply
market .

the us federal-state welfare system, established by the 1935 social security
act, has generated an enormous number of individual case files on welfare
applicants and recipients, which are of great historical value. in 1978 a
questionnaire was sent to all state archivists to identify current practices
and principal problems encountered regarding the accessioning of public
welfare case records. the study was restricted to federal-state categorical
income maintenance programmes. a 92% response rate yielded data on the value
of case records as research materials, whether or not state archives accession
public welfare case records, primary problems presented by the records, and
possible practicable solutions to these problems.

the general point is stressed that library collections in tropical and
sub-tropical climates are subject to the same dangers as those in moderate
climate zones; but it must be understood that all these dangers are increased,
some of them dramatically, in warm damp climates. in tropical and sub-tropical
climates there is the threat of damage by insects of a nature and to an extent
that is unknown in moderate climate zones and finally, it is not possible to
change this situation fundamentally by any conservation or restoration
measures, at least not without an expenditure that would be unrealistic in
present terms of manpower and energy.

council on library resources and the andrew mellon foundation. the need for
further progress was emphasised, and it was agreed that there was a foundation
on which to build. the conference participants concluded that it is reasonable
to balance the physical durability of books and their intellectual and
cultural worth. discussion topics included permanence and durability of paper,
its availability and costs, categories of books and journals to be routinely
manufactured on permanent and durable paper, promotion of alkaline and durable
papers outside the us, and the possibility of manufacturing copies of books
for libraries separately.

in 1979 in the usa, over 10 billion exposures were made by 45 billion cameras,
but most of these photographs will eventually be lost, thrown away,
self-destruct or be forgotten before anyone even thinks of preserving them for
posterity. many institutions have already amassed too many photographs, and so
perhaps preservation must be carried out by the photographs' originators. only
now is some effort being made to establish programmes for the formal training
of conservators, and most amateurs still want cheap, quick and easy solutions.
it falls to librarians, archivists and curators, therefore to make useful
information readily available to those who ask for it and to be prepared to
carry it to those who do not. presents a list of useful and recent source
materials on photo-conservation. if public consciousness can be raised enough
to seek and follow the advice given by professionals, much of the usa's
photographic heritage can be s aved.

enumerates and comments on the many factors that cause increased need for
academic library space. since the collection occupies only from 25-45% of the
floorspace in large academic libraries, these other factors must also be
studied and remedied in order to limit building growth. the following measures
to slow the increase in storage space are reviewed in detail' weeding;
zero-growth; compact storage; coordinated acquisitions; miniaturisation. in
connection with the arrangement of stored materials, detailed arguments are
cited why browsing is an insufficient retrieval device for serious research.
the point is made that a combination of the above measures is needed to reduce
space pressures inherited from the past. furthermore, in acknowledgement of
the studies showing that a high proportion of acquired works is rarely if ever
used, a more limited and regionally coordinated selection policy is needed to
reduce future space pressures.

the current czechoslovak standard csn 01 0195 (bibliographical and cataloguing
record) does not contain an exhaustive description of special documents, but a
reworking of this standard is planned in the near future. thus, a more
detailed guidance must be sought in various cataloguing directives published
between 1969 and 71, which give a good description and numerous practical
examples. special materials briefly discussed are sheet music and records,
patents and standards, graphics and audiovisuals, archive material and
documents. rational approach to work with special documents includes group
cataloguing and machine processing, especially of technical material.
methodological centres should extablish which materials cause libraries the

presents a new approach to document retrieval based on a semantic model for
natural language. the content of a document is represented using the
hierarchical model of knowledge representation, its sentences being translated
into logical representations which are integrated into the knowledge base as
an organised knowledge structure. queries are also in natural language, from
which retrieval commands are automatically generated. answers are synthesised
from the results of retrieval. a working system called lgs (literature guide
system) has been constructed. this can answer questions based on the
integrated abstracts of scientific literature. examples using lgs are

contribution to a section on current trends in classification research. in the
context of natural classification systems development, classification is
viewed as the grouping of objects in classes (taxons) and as the finding of
common structures (archetypes) within the objects. an archetype is a structure
of parts (merons). the classification procedure can be represented as an
interactive process whereby the grouping by taxons alternates with the
identification of taxon archetypes, which are used again to update the taxon
composition. presents a mathematical description of the relationship between
the taxonomic grouping of objects and their partitioning into merons, with
special mention of the methodological problems of classification.

contribution to a section on current trends in classification research. based
on the paper 'a general theory of sil, popsi and classaurus', submitted for
discussion at the international classification research forum, minneapolis,
oct 79. a brief account of 3 indian classification research contributions. a
general theory of subject indexing language (sil) has been developed through
logical abstraction of the structures of outstanding sils. the language of
postulate-based permuted subject indexing (popsi) has been developed through
the interpretation of the structure of sils forming part of the general
theory. the classaurus has also been formulated; this is a faceted systematic
scheme of hierarchical classification having all the necessary attributes of a
conventional thesaurus, excluding the numeration of other related terms and is
especially meant to facilitate the use of popsi.

review of systems of subject cataloguing (classification) in large general
libraries, particularly in socialist countries, western europe and north
america' national, university, large public and academy of sciences libraries
were taken into account. discusses subject headings and use of the main
classification schemes, including dewey, library of congress and colon.
classification methods employed in national bibliography production are also
described. the largest group of libraries uses its own systems, then
successively ddc, lcc, udc and bbk. the situation is unlikely to change much
in the future, but the number of libraries using their own schemes will
diminish, while the classed catalogue together with the alphabetical subject
catalogue will probably become more common.

he theme of the meeting was biological nomenclature and classification applied
to information retrieval. amongst the subjects discussed were zoological
nomenclature and taxonomy, names of living organisms in a thesaurus on animal
health and hygiene; and taxonomy and the science reference library
classification. all 13 papers are reprinted, and a summary of the discussion
follows.

.W
contribution to a section on current trends in classification research.
contrasts the visible crisis of universal classification systems in the last
4-5 decades with their significant development during 1876-1907. points out
some signs of revival in the 1970s-the appearance of several general
classification systems having up to 3-4,000 headings. stresses the need for
such systems and enumerates their main applications. distinguishes the levels
of specificity of universal classification systems and discusses their future
prospects.

.I 1879
.W
the condition of the libraries in europe, ussr and usa is analysed
comparatively with that of the libraries in other parts of the world and
rumania. the study focuses on the use of classifications, their area of
application, their advantages and deficiencies, laying a special stress on the
use of the universal decimal classification under its different versions.

.I 1880
.W
contribution to a section on current trends in classification research.
examines the nature of the relationships between classification systems,
focusing on extentional similarity. some parallels are identified between the
concordancing of classification systems and the compiling of union lists.
concordance of classification systems is a most useful aid for the improvement
of interlibrary cooperation.

.I 1881
.W
outlines the main features of the bliss bibliographic classification,
describing and evaluating the improvements made in the 2nd edition. although
overshadowed by the major schemes it constitutes a notable achievement and
still has potential albeit in a restricted market.

the university of dayton's roesch library required a classification scheme for
its local documents collection. it needed a scheme that would assign each
title a unique call number. existing schemes were examined but rejected. a new
alphanumeric scheme was devised. it is intended primarily for collections
limited to publications from the government and civic organisations of no more
than several counties.

.I 1883
.W
presents letters exchanged between mary kay pietris, chief of the library of
congress subject cataloging division, and sandy berman, head cataloguer at
hennepin county library, minnesota, on whether subject headings should follow
or usher in social changes. the letters were written during aug 79-aug 80 and
discuss in greatest detail the seniors/aged and handicapped/disabled
alternatives.

the work reported uses a coding scheme developed for augmenting the subject
strings to make them suitable for generating a thesaurus. the system is fully
automatic unlike earlier systems. it has 5 phases namely, coding phase,
term-pair generation phase, coordinate term-pair generation phase, translation
phase and printing phase. the system is described briefly giving the systems
flow chart and inputs and outputs of the different phases together with a
sample printout of a model thesaurus generated using test data of about 60
subject strings in telephony.

report of a seminar on tci's arms installations (automated records management
system), 12 june 80. each arms application is a separately engineered system,
combining advanced micromedia, computer and video techniques to provide secure
document control and immediate access. an arms installation could have 4
different subsystems' document indexing, video distribution, digital drawing,
and a document scanner/com system. the price ranges from *6500,000 to *62
million. questions the need for such systems in the uk and europe.

.I 1886
.W
discusses the possibilities of a holographic method of ultraminiaturisation,
storage, and retrieval of documentary information and investigates the
operation and design principles and features of such a system.

.I 1887
.W
reviews non-soviet literature (1972-77) on the problems of creating
computer-readable information carriers; describes the differences between
batch and on-line processing data bases; and discusses data base selection
problems.

.I 1888
.W
as a 1st step in determining uk local authority information-processing
equipment needs, the local government operational research unit compiled a
directory of the main data holdings in berkshire local authorities and
monitored its use by local officers. the directory was little-used; when
officers required data, they asked personal contacts. this indicates that the
value of providing extensive search and retrieval facilities in local
authorities should be questioned. the introduction of electronic
record-keeping may be the most effective way to use the new technology.

.I 1889
.W
presents a collective description and discussion of 3 updateable microfiche
systems-the a.b. dick system 200 record processor, the microx system ii, and
the microvonics file, with details of basic design, recording technologies,
operation, input accepted, microfiche formats, titling, accessories and
prices.

b-trees (balanced trees) are used for the maintenance of very large indexes. a
state vector and system of differential equations describing the behaviour of
state changes, form a deterministic model of the static properties. a uniform
distribution of keys is assumed. static properties, operations on b-trees, and
overflow and underflow treatment are defined. a basic model of b-trees is used
to model space utilisation and path length which is then applied to the
treatment of underflow and overflow in b-tree organisation.

.I 1891
.W
the design of information systems requires information content to be defined
independently from the handling of information. the infological perspective
stresses this and is based on a semantical model rather than a real-world
model. some of the basic infological concepts discussed are the informational
representation of data items, elementary messages and their structure, and
e-sentences. a large number of concepts and terms is required with a
qualitative and quantitative information data dictionary consistent with the
relevant user view. the characteristics and formation of concept data objects
and property references are described, creating a hierarchic concept
structure. the hermeneutical circle (infological meaning in hermeneutical
texts) is demonstrated, and the infological and datalogical user views are
described and compared.

.I 1892
.W
work by the uk construction industry to improve its communications is outlined
with specific emphasis on the development of a 'meta-system' embracing various
word control and classification tools. the need to relate this work to the
problem of computer file organisation is stressed. a study being undertaken by
the uk department of the environment to determine the nature of this
relationship and the benefits which closer collaboration would bring is
described.

.I 1894
.W
contribution to a thematic issue on on-line technology. argues that the
continued growth of on-line information retrieval services has increased the
number of data bases consulted for any one search, and so has brought about
changes in the role of the searcher and the on-line service vendor. describes
how us data base vendor sdc search service has responded to the need for cross
data base searching by software modification, standardisation of field names
and search qualifiers, and by the introduction of a save search facility.
discusses in detail the use of a particular saved search strategy for cross
data base searching, and emphasises the resulting benefits in terms of
efficiency and economy.

report on the online '79 conference and exhibition, with summaries of papers
and proceedings. one topic emphasised by many was the importance of the
pre-search interview in data base searching. other discussion topics included
subject switching in multiple data base searching, 2excerpta medica1,
free-text searching on medline, data base searching on the mineral industries,
and on-line bibliographic searching techniques.

.I 1896
.W
a prototype associative interactive dictionary (aid) system has been developed
to assist in search strategy formulation on a large operational free-text
on-line bibliographic retrieval system. the primary design objective is the
automatic generation and display of related terms, broader and narrower terms,
and other semantic associations for given search concepts. the associative
text analysis procedures rely on statistical frequency distribution
information about term occurrences in the data base and in retrieved sets of
documents.

the federal government's programme for the promotion of information and
documentation was passed on 17 dec 74. the aim of the programme was to
coordinate and improve activities in the information and documentation sector
which had developed rapidly in recent years. the programme concentrated on
setting up 4 subject oriented data systems' patents, research procedure,
environment and technological rules. the progress in each area has been
different. 17 libraries received an on-line connection to the dimdi (deutsche
insitut fur medizinische dokumentation und information) data bank in cologne
in the framework of a project organised by the ministry for research and
technology. libraries also had on-line connections to data banks formed by the
information centre for energy, physics and mathematics. the question of
finance is the largest obstacle to university libraries providing permanent o
n-line facilities for literature research. although some on-line data services
are available to libraries free of charge the cost of the hardware has to be
covered by the libraries.

.I 1898
.W
state-of-the-art review, analysis and projection of the use of
machine-readable data bases, including on-line search services and on-line
support services. emphasises the application of bibliographic data bases for
special libraries and the potential of such files for future use. also
discusses current use and applications of non-bibliographic files.

.I 1899
.W
the responses to an evaluation questionnaire administered primarily to
1st-time and remote-site users of a corporate library on-line search service
indicated that the searches yield a high % of relevant citations for most
users. a further correlation between the users' responses to broad relevance
categories and their presence at the terminal during the search reconfirmed
the importance of interactive feedback between the user and the search
intermediary in improving search precision. the study identified significant
time savings by the users. most respondents endorsed the cost effectiveness of
the service, particularly those involved in ongoing research projects or
starting a new project.

kuwait has become one of the countries to receive medlars by satellite, and
there is an on-line system between the kuwait university hospital and the
national library of medicine (nlm) in the usa. it receives index medicus, and
enquiries can be transmitted directly from medlars through the on-line system.
sdi and off-line services are also available. medlars coverage includes
cancerline, toxline and chemline.

results of an investigation into telecommunications and information services
in rural areas. the objective was to assess the extent to which developments
in telecommunication technology could affect the provision of information
services in rural areas and hence to assess the need for planning policies to
encompass and consider such developments.

the 1st part of a 3-part survey, comprising the following' british telecom
gets down to business, by peter benton (describes the application of new
technology in the uk telecommunications industry); plugging into the network,
by norman hoppe (outlines available electronic switching systems and their
future in the uk); the essential link, by david harvey (describes the
application of microelectronics to the telephone, which has resulted in
automatic dialling and answering machines); remote communications (outlines
remote and mobile systems of communication available in the uk); instant
confirmation (outlines facsimile transmission facilities in the uk); and

articles are all by elizabeth hennessy.

.I 1903
.W
contribution to a thematic issue on on-line technology. reviews the background
to the setting up of the european space agency's information retrieval
services. describes briefly its interactive on-line information retrieval
system (nasa/recon) which was developed for the us national aeronautics and
space administration, and which allows users to formulate simple or complex
search requests via a terminal coupled to the information retrieval service's
computer in italy. discusses the indexing policies of the data base suppliers,
together with the problems faced by the information retrieval service in
creating files from these data bases. considers the difference between
controlled and uncontrolled or free indexing techniques, and discusses the
advantages and disadvantages of descriptor versus free text searching.

.I 1904
.W
the history of viewdata is traced and the differences between viewdata (eg
prestel) and teletext (eg ceefax) are discussed. also described are the user's
equipment, the data base, viewdata operation, and similar systems developed in
other countries.

.I 1905
.W
prestel, antiope and telidon videotex systems are compared. brief descriptions
are given of each, with particular reference to the system used for the
graphic display and the quality of display which can be achieved. the costs of
the 3 systems are discussed and their future development and marketing
intentions are mentioned.

.I 1906
.W
the threat to the traditional newspaper which is posed by such systems as
ceefax and oracle is discussed, and the ways in which the newspaper can remain
competitive are shown. the costs involved in electronic newspaper systems are
examined, and it is suggested that with good control on production costs the
newspaper can offer a more attractive medium.

.I 1907
.W
a background is given to the development of electronic advertising in the usa
followed by a survey of equipment. the struggle between newspaper, yellow
pages and at & t for a place in the electronics advertising and information
market is described. the status of various viewdata and teletext systems is
reviewed. the range of types of equipment on show is described and some trends
are identified.

.I 1908
.W
newspapers are facing challenges from the new media of teletext, viewdata
systems, and home computers. teletext provides news immediately, simply,
conveniently, and inexpensively. however, it does not provide the browse and
scan options of newspapers. of greater potential impact is the development of
viewdata systems which use the television, telephone, and computer so that
on-line searching can be done from the home. the system can also be modified
to use a home computer rather than a television screen. changes in how people
spend their leisure time and their disposable income, combined with the
stagnation of newspaper readership and the increasingly important role of
information in society, suggest that newspapers should look into new options.

.I 1909
.W
the results of a test carried out by online computer library center to develop
and test a library electronic home information system, to quantify potential
user demand and attitudes, to identify the need for additional information
services, to evaluate the existing environment and potential competition, to
determine the social issues involved and to examine the role of libraries in
the evolving marketplace are reported.

.I 1910

the 2nd part of a 3-part survey, comprising the following articles' growth of
a new medium, by elizabeth hennessy (an account of the growth of videotext in
the uk and its business applications); prestel' first year review, by richard
hooper (a summary of prestel's achievements since it was introduced in sept
79, foreign competitors, and future prospects); viewdata services, by tim
chapman (an outline of viewdata's unique features guaranteeing its success as
a communications medium and an account of its business applications); the

information provider).

.I 1911
.W
it is argued that so far, prestel has failed to become as successful as
british telecom originally hoped. argues that telesoftware could make the
whole system cost-effective and encourage more subscribers. the need for
standards is stressed and those already emerging are described. at present,
there are 3 versions of telesoftware on prestel, all using basic.

.I 1912
.W
the possible future for electronic yellow pages is examined. the state of the
art is described, followed by an account of videotex systems. the way in which
yellow pages and such systems may interact is discussed. the implications of
electronic yellow pages for major companies involved are examined.

.I 1913
.W
the possibility of combining communications networks and videotex services is
discussed, with particular reference to the ways in which euronet diane
network could be interworked with the existing european videotex services. the
following possibilities of interworking are considered' euronet as a means of
connecting customers to a foreign videotex centre; as a link between videotex
centres and the private computers of information providers; as a means of
enabling the videotex terminal to access sti data bases; as a means of
enabling euronet diane users with a tty-compatible terminal to access a
videotex centre. consideration is also given to adapting and connecting
terminals, formatting, command sequences and character recognition.

.I 1914
.W

.W
the newspaper publishing interests of the nihon keizai shimbun company
(nikkei) are described and its establishment of a total economic information
system based on the nikkei data bank called needs is described. international
transmission of financial information, an information exchange agreement with
a us data bank company, the quick on-line information network and nikkei svp
service are discussed. the needs-ir japanese language information retrieval
system with on-line access through telephone lines using the one megabit chip
and the nikkei news recall service are also examined.

.I 1916
.W
the captain interactive videotex and the teletext and telescan distributed
videotex systems are described. interactive cable communications systems using
conventional coaxial techniques and glass fibre technology and the video
response system are discussed. the state of technical development at the
japanese newspapers and their attitudes to communications developments are
considered and the problems associated with the typesetting of japanese
characters explained.

.I 1917
.W
details are given of a trial jointly sponsored by knight-ridder and american
telephone and telegraph co. to test the reaction of american families to an
experimental viewdata system, called viewtron. at & t provided the
communications lines, the special frame-creation terminals and user terminals,
while knight-ridder supplied the computers, developed the software and
supplied the news. the growth of the content base since the test was launched
and the information providers are discussed. the system can also be used to
order merchandise electronically and the possibility of banking by viewtron is
being tested.

.I 1918
.W
describes domestic (development of minicomputer applications in an environment
of scientific and technological information centres) project, a german-israeli
project for developing the application of minicomputers to information
centres. system modules include functions for creating and updating data
bases, formulating and running data base searches, and printing search
results. the information system is applicable to the acquisition, cataloguing,
circulation, and statistical needs of information centres.

.I 1919
.W
powerful microcomputer systems have become available at a cost which many
individuals and small libraries can afford. discusses present and near-term
future capabilities of microcomputers for personal information systems and
requirements for such systems. examines currently available hardware and
software in terms of these requirements, also current trends.

.I 1920
.W
the evaluation of machine-readable reference retrieval services into a major
resource for technology transfer has been attended by a host of technical
communication problems which are being addressed through a variety of
educational approaches. presents an overview of developmental patterns for
these emerging reference retrieval services and relates them in a
'cause-effect' perspective. using a 'word picture', depicts the organisational
and functional components of the bibliographic chain (information
generation-transformation-use). presents a variety of educational approaches
to end user audiences and explores the role of the producers of the services.

.I 1921
.W
the success or failure of machine-readable data bases and on-line search
systems depends to a great extent on people's awareness of them. education and
training programmes in data base utilisation must emphasize both an
understanding of the characteristics and structure of the data bases and
experience in using on-line retrieval systems. effective teaching methods
include the use of printed materials, demonstrations, audio-visual aids, and
computer-assisted instruction at the terminal.

.I 1922
.W
contribution to a thematic issue on on-line educators sponsored by the british
library research and development board, 4-6 dec 79. examines the goals of the
various groups concerned with on-line promotion, training and education.
describes recent developments in on-line teaching/learning in europe,
including the increase in on-line seminars, and the emergence of systems/data
base independent training. discusses the role of on-line groups and the
library schools in on-line teaching and learning, and describes some recent
developments in end-user on-line education. outlines the future needs for
on-line teaching, and suggests an on-line education data base and clearing
house as a means of facilitating future cooperation.

contribution to a thematic issue on on-line technology. paper presented at the
1979 association of french librarians congress on user education and already
published in 2ass. bibliot. fr. bull. inf.1 (105) 4th quarter 79, 201-204
(2see1 80/4048).

.W
the current state of the art of information processing tends to link certain
capabilities (such as protection of data integrity and confidentiality and
monitoring user/data interactions) with large data base systems. this is most
unfortunate, since such capabilities are frequently vital for modest
applications which do not have the degree of data complexity to justify the
use of large data base systems and which may not be able to afford them.
describes an effort to bridge this gap in current electronic data processing
technology by means of a new linguistic concept of files which is designed to
simulate a dependable archivist rather than a passive filing cabinet.

.I 1925
.W
a report on contributions on data base and information systems at the 8th
world computer congress, 1980. subjects of papers included' the state of the
art in relational data base systems; the impact of structured data throughout
computer-based information systems; the concepts of an information system and
information requirements; relational data theory for data bases; pipeline
searching and sorting modules as components of a data flow data base computer;
the design and experimental implementation of a data base machine with
magnetic bubble memory technology, edc; problems of sorting and searching in a
magnetic bubble memory; an overview of the system for business automation
(bsa); the french polypheme distributed data base management system. the
proceedings, edited by s.h. lavington, are published by north-holland
publishing company, 1980, under the title 2information processing '801.

.I 1926
.W
the future of electronic publishing and its importance for the business press
are considered. discusses the role of the government, the state of the art,
market acceptability and the role of advertising. creation of a computer data
bank is described. data base publishing is examined in contrast to traditional
publishing and its impact on the editorial process is described.

.I 1927
.W
describes the results of a series of test searches carried out on 2economics
abstracts international1 (eai), a relatively new on-line bibliographic data
base covering economics and marketing information. in particular, the data
base was compared to the well-established predicasts family of data bases. it
was found that they are complementary, in that for particular types of search
(e.g. company information), predicasts is a better service and for others
(e.g. theoretical economics) eai is superior. in the field of marketing
information, both provide hits. predicasts identified short, up-to-date news
items and eai in-depth studies. critical comments are made on geographic
coverage, on the use of universal decimal classification numbers for
subject-matter searching, and on the timeliness of eai.

.W
omputers and communications are converging to spawn mammoth networks-the
concept of total networking already involves the chief us high technology
firms who are vying for leadership in the emerging unified-information market.
reviews the work of these firms in providing the 6 crucial elements in total
networking' a control function, computer processing, a compatibility function,
long haul transmission, local (city) distribution, and inter-office access.

.W
the final part of a 3-part survey, comprising the following articles' a
formula for data processing success, by tony hardcastle (discusses the
definition of a company's need for computerised data processing and
identification of the appropriate system); how to cut office costs by david
harvey (presents the economics of using word processors in offices); the trend
to integration, by elizabeth hennessy (outlines some compatible electronic and
telecommunications equipment which can be used to produce totally integrated
office systems); and planning a strategy for success, by muir moffatt (warns
business to examine their requirements and the claims of equipment suppliers
if they are to keep good control of office overheads).

.I 1930
.W
the tgr experimental relational data base system is described. its use of
microprogrammed data base primitives and optimisation features is intended to
increase the speed of retrieval. the feedback-optimisation strategy is
illustrated using 2-variable expressions and arbitrary (multi-variable)
expressions. the use of filters and their rules for construction are
described, and illustrated in the conjunctive normal form. tgr is briefly
compared with damas, and its implementation using the bclp language described.
statistics on performance show that the feedback-optimisation is best suited
for queries involving many relations and performance is poor with large
relations, it cannot therefore be used as a stand-alone optimisation method.
more research is needed to select the right options.

.I 1931
.W
a set of language facilities for the specification of security policy in
relational data bases is presented. an integrated approach to the description
of the data base, access rights of users, and use of data is based on the
hypol language. generic rights or types of access are defined over the domains
of the data base whereas data base operations are over the entire relation.
language facilities are described to produce a static definition of the
capabilities of users with the incorporation of changes. the appendix lists
the syntactic definitions of language constructs used. hypol language
facilities are then contrasted with ims for hierarchical data bases, dbtg for
network and relational data bases, and ingres and system r for relational data
bases.

.I 1932
.W
the state of the commercial speech recognition art today as manifested by
available devices is reviewed and the capabilities of such devices are
discussed.

.I 1933
.W
job satisfaction of 202 data processing personnel as assessed by the
2minnesota satisfaction questionnaire1 (msq) are presented. comparisons of 20
job satisfaction levels are made for these dp personnel and other studies of
accountants and engineers utilising the msq. satisfaction with advancement and
compensation was particularly low for the dp personnel. when compared with
accountants and engineers, these dp personnel consistently reported lower job
satisfaction. dp operations personnel reported lower job satisfaction than the
other dp functional groups.

.W
a model is developed for routing in data communication networks. it gives rise
to a routing algorithm that can be implemented in a distributed fashion and
furthermore has the properties of being loop-free, reducing the delay in the
network at each step, and converging to optimal minimum delay routing.

.I 1935
.W
a framework is presented for planning a network for a computer service
delivery system. this framework makes explicit a planning matrix for factoring
the computer needs of the users in manageable units and develops the
parameters for deciding on a suitable network to meet the political and
economic requirements of management. the matrix gives the basis for studying
alternative configurations for merging the individual needs of the users. for
studying configurations beyond a stand-alone system, the concept of a node is
introduced, permitting the consideration of a set of 6 categories of
parameters. viewpoints of network structures having various degrees of
organisational complexity are defined in terms of the nodal parameters.

.W
store-and-forward network deadlocks may be avoided by forwarding messages from
buffer to buffer in accordance with a loop-free directed buffer graph which
accommodates all the desired message routes. use of guaranteed paths in the
buffer graph and optional path switching are described, along with message
reclassification to free members of the common buffer pool. an efficient
buffer-counting procedure in each node handles messages requiring several
buffers, increases flexibility of buffer usage, minimises overheads during
message reclassification or path switching, and simplifies jumping between
normal low-overhead operation when deadlock is far and more careful operation
when deadlock is near.

describes the programme of experimental research in distributed
(decentralised) systems carried out in the computer communications networks
group, university of waterloo, ontario, for the last 6 years. focuses on
inter-process communication (ipc) techniques and compares message-switched ipc
facilities in several distributed systems developed at waterloo and elsewhere.
points of comparison include message management, synchronisation modes, and
performance. examines reasons for the waterloo team's almost invariable choice
of message-switched ipc for its distributed systems.

briefly surveys events during the last 10 years which show an increased
interpenetration of the telecommunications and information processing worlds.
considers technical work at the international organization for standardization
and ccitt (international telegraph and telephone consultative committee, part
of the international telecommunication union) on the definition of a model of
network architecture, its advantages, and its limitations. lays special
emphasis on the definition of a network-independent data transmission service,
now a key issue in the world of standards. indicates how new telecommunication
services (such as teletex, fax, and videotex) may be accommodated in france
over the next few years.

.W
outlines the present state of computer communications and future trends. the
configuration of data communications is changing from a star-like to mesh-like
layout in which many computers and terminals are connected through a digital
data network. public data networks providing either packet- or
circuit-switching are in service. network architectures permitting connection
of computers and terminals of different makes and models are commercially
available and are in the process of being standardised internationally.
packet-switching technology has been extended to encompass communications
satellites, radio, and local hoops.

to make the market estimates and forecasts required for the eurodata '79 study
into data communications in western europe, logica ltd. segmented the market
in terms of applications. based on the study's findings, lists the main data
communications applications and explains the method used to classify and
identify them. presents some key results, including extent of usage of each
application by different industries and the characteristics of user
establishments in numbers and types of terminals. ways in which such an
application-oriented approach are being used are summarised.

2 important problems in designing computer networks are investigated and
solved for 2-computer networks' assignment of programme modules and data files
to the different computers in the network and selection of capacities in the
network. the interdependences of an application programme's modules and files
are represented, using a graph model. a branch-and-bound algorithm is
developed to minimise programme execution time. a 2nd, earlier-developed
algorithm is used with the 1st algorithm to allocate a fixed number of dollars
among the network's subsystems such that the programme execution time is again
minimised. presents results obtained by using the algorithms with
experimentally-measured data.

olivetti's network file system (nfs) is a standardised service providing file
access, management and transfer independently of file location, specific host
system, or data type. it is part of the company's distributed data processing
architecture. discusses the principles which led to the design of nfs;
introduces the concept of a virtual file used by nfs; describes the nfs
architecture and functions of each element; and explains the basic facilities
available.

considers packet-queueing processes in 2 interfering buffered packet radio
units that share a slotted aloha broadcast channel. shows that classical
approximation schemes fail to provide adequate predictions concerning
interfering queueing and introduces a new scheme, topological approximation,
which provides an exact solution of an approximate model, obtained by
perturbing the topology of interference. analysis shows that interference may
be cured by increasing the interference and that 'maximum interference'
provides a superb flow-regulating mechanism and the best possible
delay-throughout performance.

improvements in digital video typography are seen as a necessary component of
increased interactivity and scope of use of soft copy text display systems. a
grayscaling scheme produces high-quality fonts for display with standard
colour video equipment, reducing scintillation, smoothing curves, and
improving encodability. the same concept allows a 'virtual resolution' far
beyond the spatial resolution of normal pixel size, permitting up to 80
characters per line of readable text on colour televisions.

administration in coping with problems of handling voluminous data in order to
make meaningful decisions in an ever-diminishing time frame. highlights indian
government plans to introduce computer networks incorporating data base
management techniques. describes the rationale governing the indian law of
information repository location and the 'tmj' (top-middle-junior level)
analysis of government management. hopes that india's experience will
contribute to the development of public administration information systems in
other developing countries.

network); work on distributed data bases; technical aspects; and problems
relating to the distributed data base management system under development. the
planned system is based on a single host, univac 1100/42, running the
university's own version of dms 1100 (an implementation of the codasyl dbtg
model), with heterogeneous remote nodes (pdp 11s, decsystem 10s, data general
novas and hewlett packard 21mx and 2100 machines), supporting anunet
communications protocols and data base message level protocols.

a questionnaire survey was conducted covering 75 on-line terminal operators at
a large gas utility. they were asked to give preference ratings to alternative
arrangements with regard to panelling, seating, background music, and the
location of a terminal on the desk. the majority of the respondents preferred
an open space layout to layouts with some panels, and some background music to
no music. these results are in conformity with the findings of most past
studies. as to seating arrangements, they gave the highest preference to a
random arrangement made independent of the employee's sex or seniority. with
respect to the location of a terminal, the lefthand side of the operator was
rated highest by about 1/2 of the respondents, and the centre of the desk by
1/4 of them.

describes the japanese word processor jw-10, which is the 1st such processor
in the world. the most difficult aspect in developing a japanese word
processor is finding an easy input method for the numerous chinese characters
used in japanese. for text input, jw-10 performs a kara-to-kanji
(phonogram-to-ideogram) translation through grammatic analysis and
consultation with an 80,000-word dictionary.

teletex and telemail are discussed as possible means of developing an
electronic mail system. it is expected that electronic mail systems will grow
rapidly. teletex will remain in the control of the ptis, however the price of
a terminal is a major problem at the moment. a solution to this problem from
france is briefly described. telemail in the uk is controlled by british
telecom and at present offers a similar service to the telex system.

the numerous benefits of establishing satellite systems have been realised by
the north american countries, europe, japan, and the ussr. there is no doubt
that south america will soon participate in satellite systems. of primary
importance now is to convince south america that a locally-constructed
educational satellite system would not impose foreign cultural domination, but
would be one of the best ways by which south americans could be liberated,
giving an economic solution to their growing educational problems.

traces the salient phases of the evolution of us domestic satellite
communications from the proposals advanced during 1965-67 to the events which
culminated in the 'open entry' policy announced by the federal communication
commission in early 1970. the applications submitted by 8 entities in 1971 are
briefly reviewed and various constraints which reduced the number of separate
systems that eventually attained operational status are surveyed. outlines 4
systems (those of western union, american satellite corporation, rca, and
comsat general/at&t-gsat), discusses the forthcoming all-digital
communications satellite system of sbs, and looks ahead to future systems and

since the late 1970s, the japanese nippon telegraph and telephone public
corporation has been conducting research to determine which visual
communications services and study programmes will be required in the 1980s.
market research was carried out to ascertain the major visual communications
requirements in leading business organisations. the systems found to have the
greatest potential for development were videoconferencing, interactive
information retrieval, facsimile, document processing, and office automation
(the latter integrating all 4 systems). in the light of these results,
suggests a study programme for the 80s and indicates which technologies should
be developed.

reproduced from 2the journal of applied behavioral science1, 1974. cites some
problems concerning organisational development (the application of changes and
achievement of goals in an organisation), the resolution of which will
facilitate the transition of organisational development from a miscellany of
uncertain devices to a mature, usable set of principles and procedures and
thus make the discipline better than it is at present, in both theory and

in 2fortune 5001 organisations and a survey of information systems faculty of
accredited business schools with respect to their opinions on the desired
composition of undergraduate programmes in information systems offered by
schools of business. information is presented on the respondent's opinions
about the relative importance of' (1) educational output objectives that
graduates of such programs might be expected to possess and (2) courses and
topics within courses designed to achieve these objectives. similarities and
differences between business and academic responses are analysed.

the outbreak of war is generally thought to shift the fields in which research
is conducted. as a result, military conflict has historically been credited
with being the catalyst which has caused decisive technological advances. it
is also generally suggested that warfare has a systematic impact on the
intensity of inventive activity. most scholars have claimed that wars increase
inventiveness, although a few argue that conflict is a hinderance to research.
this question has not received extensive empirical examination. using us data,
a basic pattern is repeatedly observed. immediately after the outbreak of a
war, there is a significant decline in inventiveness, which is followed by a
marked surge. the average net result is a virtual negation of the 2 trends.

contribution to an issue devoted to library services for the disabled.
discusses the swedish 'er' (easy to read) book system, instigated by a working
group at the national swedish board of education. the books are designed for
particular reader groups, primarily adult readers, who have great difficulties
in reading or in understanding what they read. 100 or so titles have been
published to date, and it is planned to publish a further 15-20 titles per
year. a special experiment has been started involving the publication of er
books for children and young people, although production of er books for
adults is still a priority.

since the end of world war ii, much greater attention has been paid to local
history in bulgaria than was previously the case. staff in the regional
central libraries have made a great effort to produce and publish relevant
bibliographies and other material dealing with the past and present of their
particular regions. as a rule, significant politicians and political events
are well covered by such publications, as are writers and other prominent
people who either live or lived in the region, or who were born there, but who
are now more widely known. names of numerous publications are given, which can
be considered valuable aids to those studying local history. topics dealing,
for instance, with the regions' economy, cultural life, health service, arts
and other aspects must not be neglected, as people need to know of social and
other changes in their surroundings. gradually, the information given should
be extended to include sma ller and/or specialised sections of the region,
such as towns and particular industries.

behavioural research offers a number of different techniques for use during
the design of written materials. explores the pros and cons of 4 of these, in
relation to a 3-stage quality-control programme. the 3 stages involve checks
on the content, the presentation and usability of documents. the complexities
of design problems are such that the research literature will seldom be able
to provide instant solutions. nevertheless, research techniques provide ways
of guiding and vaildating the decisions of writers and designers.

although functional objectives have concerned designers for many years, and
psychologists have published research on issues related to graphic design,
fruitful cooperation between the 2 specialisms has only rarely been achieved.
suggests that the traditional objectives and methods of neither group are

a survey was made of 220 uk learned societies in the fields of arts,
humanities and social sciences. the aim was to assess whether they had excess
book-length material which they considered worthy of publication but could not
afford to publish. further, they were asked whether they had considered the
option of on-demand (od) publishing and what features an on-demand system
should have. of 101 usable responses, 24 said that they did have such an
excess, totalling 160 manuscripts. overall, 38 felt that there was a need for
some centrally organised od facility. the most important features of such a
system would be quality control, price and hard-copy availability.

in the netherlands bookclubs have recently been severely criticised by authors
for paying much smaller royalties than the normal booktrade. the 1st bookclub
in the netherlands was founded in 1937 and there are now 6 registered clubs
with a total membership of approx. 1 1/2 million members. the market share of
the bookclubs in the netherlands has risen from 2% in 1966 to 24% in 1980. the
removal of the collective price agreement on books would also be disastrous
for the smaller bookshops and publishers and for lesser-known authors.
booksellers and publishers must now come to a trading arrangement with the
bookclubs. it is, however, fortunate that the larger bookclubs are themselves
part of the publishing trade.

types of publication best suited for conversion from print to electronic
media; and some electronic publishing issues (rival attractions of text and
data base; authorship, copyright, and forgery; quality of writing; and
information 2versus1 knowledge). opines that a book's internal organisation
helps to integrate and form thought processes and fears that electronic
publishing will deliver ever more percepts but fewer concepts-this may be the
darker side of the communications revolution.

fictional works than in modern novels, and biography is popular, but there is
little demand for such subjects as history, travel and religion. describes the
moon reader, the available literature and the production of moon books. more

although much has been said about how mankind has recorded knowledge, the
question of why record knowledge at all has not been treated systematically.
inferences and deductions from historical recording formats lead to the
conclusion that while technology has advanced the art of record keeping, the
underlying purposes have remained essentially the same-to commemorate,
communicate, pray, calculate, measure, and preserve.

was public library cooperation with other cultural institutions; several
speakers advocated more active cooperation between public libraries and
museums, adult education centres and theatres. reports on the library's role
in the advancement of literature, the preparation of new keyword cataloguing
rules by the german library institute, the work of the institute's committee

the library service in these areas is young, but statistics of usage show a
rapid growth. the need for well-trained staff and for adequate transport have
been key factors in its development. libraries there specialise in information
relevant to the exploitation of the area's natural resources and to such
projects as the baikal-amur railway, in the bibliographical control of
locally-produced material and in local history studies. requirements for
improving the service include' (1) a more balanced geographical distribution
of service points; (2) the redistribution of some stock to ensure better
usage; (3) the discovery, collection and circulation of more local material;
(4) better cooperation between both libraries and local museums.

impressions gained during an official visit to china in june 80. china has a
few very large libraries with strong collections and generous funding. many
other libraries have serious gaps in their collections as a result of the
cultural revolution. the emphasis is on academic and research libraries-there
seem to be no public libraries. services are undeveloped, buildings and
equipment are not of a high quality, there is no planned interlending system
or library coordination, and most research is concerned with automation and
information systems rather than librarianship. the chinese wish to solve their
problems themselves, although they welcome help. the whole situation is in a
state of rapid change and development.

comments on a report on library research by a committee of the librarians'
union. it wrongly contrasts librarians and academics as most librarians have
an academic training, but it stresses the need for a research council
specifically including library research in its sphere. urges that library
research should be defineed as broadly as possible, and that it should have an
aim wider than that of increasing efficiency. employers and unions should not
be part of a library research council, as suggested in the report. the report
rightly stresses the need for further education of librarians, but is wrongly
against giving formal credit to such training in the form of a degree, fearing
unnecessarily the creation of elite librarians.

cooperation with the university library in sofia, as well as regional central
libraries and some major libraries in the ussr. although the research projects
planned for the 8th 5-year plan (1981-85) are strictly scientific they are not

the library network as a whole will benefit from the results. the issues under
investigation include propaganda of literature, guided reading, open access in

series of modules. for each module the student receives a minitext, a set of
readings and a workbook. the student must study the text and readings and
complete the workbook assignments related to this module. the student passes

many library schools suffer from having too few qualified lecturers,
over-loaded and ill-planned syllabuses, and from paying too little attention
to post-graduate work. until these faults are remedied there is little hope of

for a more general syllabus, so that students emerge with detailed knowledge
of a wide range of library activities. post-graduate students need to be more
carefully selected and their dissertations more closely supervised.

at a time when aural and visual media threaten to take over. to this end the
commission has begun to cooperate with the cultural council's planned

practicality has revealed that public libraries are for all people, including
the handicapped and those of all races. this has resulted in the adjustment of

library, and the extension of the library's facilities outside its building.
in this way, the real is realised and the ideal is still pursued.

literature provision for rural areas has always been difficult. a comparison
between mobile and small village libraries shows that mobile libraries are,
contrary to popular opinion, cheaper to run; they have larger and more
frequently changed stocks and do not have to pay overheads for heating and
lighting. village libraries cannot be cultural crystallisation centres if
their stocks are inadequate. children are the main users of village libraries,
which therefore stock mainly children's books. mobile libraries carry a larger
proportion of adult material; fewer children's books are needed here since the
children have access to good school libraries. good quality literature
provision is always profitable and in contrast with village libraries, mobile
libraries always have qualified staff. the travelling library is a good
advertisement for library services.

given of glasgow's central reference library, the mitchell' points covered
include building statistics, facilities, layout, and holdings; plans of all 7
floors are included. briefer accounts cover 2 central area libraries, 1 old
and 1 new; 3 branch libraries; and the city's other reference library. the
organisation and policy of the glasgow public library system is fully
described. a succinct account of edinburgh's central library is given, and in
conclusion some comparisons are drawn with the french public library system.

academic libraries from their initial formation to their present status and
envisions possible future roles. terminology current in the field is defined.
a history of materials centres is traced from the 20s when curriculum
laboratoreis were first conceptualised, and focuses on 2 areas' the collection
of teaching materials of all kinds, and the workshop or laboratory for
developing and constructing curriculum and supplementary teaching materials.

the trier university library was opened in autumn 70 shortly before the
university itself. it faced many problems from the start and they have not yet
all been solved although the library is now operating successfully. it is run
as an integrated university library. this system brought considerable
opposition from university staff who preferred traditional institute
libraries. the library is ideally constructed for its purpose, and technical
facilities, presentation and content of library stock are also satisfactory.
the problems still existing are connected to the university laws concerning
the library which do not guarantee the competence of the library director in
library matters. this has led to interference in library affairs by other
university bodies and demands for special user rights by university staff.

a report on nakskov new main library, a combined public and school library.
the 3190 sq.m. area is split up by shelves, moveable partition walls and 4
large garden areas. although the prime function is to be a public library, an
agreement with the adjacent educational centre, housing commercial, technical
and senior secondary schools, allows the centre use of the library against a
payment of 300,000 kr. annually to be used partly on salary to a librarian. it
is hoped that the specialised material to be acquired for the students will
also benefit the public and that the 130 seat theatre hall will attract a
ready audience from the schools. interviews with librarians reveal
determination to protect the interests of the general public and by placement
of the educational department furthest away avoid dominance by the student

population of 21,000. the mayor of ishoj argued that immigrants must
assimilate and learn danish, whereas the 3 immigrant spokesman claimed that
children must learn their mother tongue properly before they can learn danish,
if they are not to be culturally isolated, knowing 2 languages only partly.
book provision was 6 books per dane, but only 1/2 per immigrant. the

provision to immigrants speaking so many different languages, and asked for
more bilingual librarians and closer contact with schools on matters of

some kind of classification of readers is necessary for the complex education
of library users. much previous research has imposed too rigid distinctions
between readers of fiction and nonfiction. a more relevant division would be
according to proficiency in different reading skills' choosing books to read;
understanding what is read; acquiring and using the information contained. 6
readership groups divided by these criteria are proposed, ranging from users
with none of these skills to those with a harmoniously developed range of
skills.

in order to develop reading on an individual basis, the librarian must be able
to categorise his readers. this can be done by a psycho-educational method,
considering both the actual reading ability and motives of the reader.
'reading ability' should take account of' direction in reading
(purposiveness); ability to select books; and ability to absorb conceptual
content. readers' motives are divided into' those whose reading is directed
towards developing their social and moral outlook; those who need help in
choosing a career; those who read to develop their personality; but further
sub-divisions may also be worked out.

the factory library should provide literature for all staff, especially the
workers. it is difficult to obtain accurate information on the reading habits
of different social groups; workers probably comprise more than 1/8 but less
then 1/2 of a factory library's readers. the factory library is the library
most likely to promote reading among the working classes. in factory
libraries, as opposed to public libraries, there are more adult readers than
teenage readers and more male readers than female. many people consider that
adults need to read more than the young and that the workers who do read, even
if only light literature, will have more active and communicative
personalities than non-readers and make a larger contribution to productivity.

the problems of acquiring and recording rare editions, leaving aside

not so the significance of its content or publication. central and regional
libraries apply different criteria and methods of collection are haphazard.
following a recent statement by the council of ministers on preserving
cultural treasures, libraries should register local private collections of
rare books and take steps to prevent them being dissipated, create union
catalogues of their holdings, and a list of the nation's most important
collections should be compiled and published.

the purpose of this study was to determine whether the average number of
citations received by issued us patents from subsequently issued us patents is
higher for patents associated with important technological advances than for a
group of randomly selected patents. analysis of examiners' citations to 100
selected patents showed that these selected patents, which underlay
technically important products, were more than twice as frequently cited as a
randomly selected set of 102 control patents. this finding provides strong
evidence for the hypothesis that patent citation data can be used in
technological indicators development, and in technological policy analysis,
since it implies that the location and analysis of groups of highly cited
patents can provide a valid indicator of patent areas of technical importance.

this evaluative study reports on the 1st year of operation of the audiovisual
resources centre in the brownless medical library of the university of
melbourne. during a representative week in each of 3 terms in 1978, every user
of the centre was requested to complete a comprehensive questionnaire. in
addition, a staff questionnaire was mailed to all medical and biological staff
of the university. the nature and extent of use of the centre were explored in
depth, as well as the relevance and adequacy of the programme with respect to
both the needs and expectations of staff and students. the report analyses the
developments to date and indicates ways in which the facility can become an
even more effective learning resource in the future. report not available from

the national institute of justice is interested in the possibility of
improving the cost effectiveness of their information dissemination programme
by making a larger part of the dissemination in microfiche instead of paper
copy. they commissioned this study on an interagency agreement to help them
decide whether microfiche dissemination would have the desired effect. the
report concludes that, as presently used, most of the advantages of microfiche
accrue to the producer, and most of the disadvantages to the user. there is
likely to be considerable resistance to broadening the use of fiche for the
intended audience of criminal justice professionals. several alternatives are
presented for lessening this problem, including emphasis on the role of
libraries, promoting the availability of fiche-to-paper copiers, and using
microfiche itself in innovative ways to facilitate information transfer,
rather than as an attempt to duplicate the features o f a paper publication in
a reduced size.

if libraries stock cassettes, new readers are attracted to the library and
loan figures rise. cassettes should be placed with or near books on the same
subject; they should be classified in the same way as books and entered in the
main catalogue. music cassettes are an excellent complement to music
literature and can stimulate people to read books about music. cassettes for
children may encourage children to read who are not yet keen readers; good
quality cassettes must be selected since there is a wide range on the market
in this field. language cassettes should be arranged on bookshelves with their
accompanying textbooks. literature cassettes are useful for readers with poor
sight, so they should be placed near the large print books; they are also
helpful for people with reading difficulties and for group listening and

events and developments occurring now and in the 1980s will have substantial

recommendations for constructing regional network systems and building up

processing in conjunction with the library committee of the german research
society (deutche forschungsgemeinschaft). they underline how necessary and
urgent it is to build up regional data processing networks for cooperative
cataloguing in libraries. regional networks provide the optimal means of
rationalising library work. these networks should not be constructed in all 11
federal states but should be built up on the existing 7 lending system
regions; they would all be connected in a national network. regional library
centres would form the national network and would have the following general
task areas' cataloguing and acquisition, central editing of catalogues etc.,
data exchange with other central institutes and networks, supplying ordered
boo ks within the planned national order system, developing systems and
programmes for the software of the regional network, and planning and
coordination.

many tasks undertaken by public libraries are political, not because they
promote party politics but because they provide enlightenment and pleasure for
each individual in a free democracy. culture involves not only beauty but also
social reality. librarians must help all handicapped people; germany is ahead
of france in library work with the physically handicapped and provision of
library facilities for foreign workers certainly involves both culture and
politics. the libraries must promote reading, or books may be ousted by
audio-visual media. stock selection criteria must be those of truth and
objectivity; the librarian must be mindful of all viewpoints, since freedom
permits opposition.

in 1979 new university laws were passed which affected polytechnic
('fachhochschul-') laws and the legal position of polytechnic libraries.
although polytechnics differ in form slightly from one state to another within
west germany, there are some general points in the new laws which influence
polytechnic libraries in the same way. the status of the libraries has become
more precise; they are recognised as central working units. the libraries now
have the right to make decisions concerning budget expenditure and the
allocation of new staff. the polytechnic library has thus become an
independent institution with its own duties and rights within the polytechnic.
however, libraries still depend on the size of allocations from the central
polytechnic bodies. final decisions on the choice of literature acquisition
can still only be made by the relevant polytechnic department with the li
brary merely acting in an advisory capacity.

examines the library literature which deals with measurement of library
effectiveness. this is usually measured in terms of loan figures, but this
method fails to take account of reference and information work, now of growing
importance. effectiveness must be seen in relation to the library's aims. a
manual for performance measures in public libraries was published in 1976 by
the american library association. for those libraries which actively promote
materials to create demands, hamburg et al (1972) suggest the following tests
for effectiveness' exposure counts, item use-days, exposure time. gore (1978)
uses the holdings rate, availability rate, and performance rate, the latter
measuring the percentage of required material available when wanted by user.
it has been pointed out that because effectiveness is a composite concept its
measurement is complex, but that relying on loan figures only is no longer
necessary.

lecture given in bonn to a study group for archives, libraries and
documentation centres (n.d.)the federal government's information and
documentation programme has as its focal point the foundation of 16
centralised subject information centres between 1974 and 1977. this initial
stage is not yet completed owing to lack of funds; only 3 centres are fully
operational. the adequacy of these centres has been questioned, especially
because of the emphasis on centralisation and the introduction of market
economy principles; information stored might be selected mainly to suit
industry. it is not yet known whether libraries must contribute towards costs,
which will be expensive. trade unionists fear that the advanced technology in

in which the library serving as the guidance centre within a network can

the library inspectorate has examined public library accounts for 1981. these
show an overall increase well within the savings circular's limit of 2% real
growth. because of book price rises, acquisitions are likely to show an
overall fall of 4%. the savings circular urged libraries to spend not more
than 185 kr. per inhabitant. it is difficult to determine what effect this
statement has had, but a closer examination shows that the highest spenders,
all in the copenhagen area, have cut down most. in the rest of the country
part-time libraries show larger percentage increases than full-time libraries.
only the southern jutland region show a considerable real increase in
expenditure on materials. as staff salaries are subject to topping up if
necessary, these do not suffer as much from cuts as material expenditure, and
the prospect is one of libraries with outdated and worn books.

up such relations in smallsite rather than large central libraries. opinions
and policies concerning subject specialist duties varied. alternatives to
subject specialist systems were not favoured. financial constraints were
having a profound effect on the efforts of polytechnics to concentrate their
work on 1 campus.

this dissertation, presented by a french university librarian in 1979,
examines 8 articles on subject specialists by uk and us librarians published
between 1967 and 1977, some debating theoretical principles and their
implementation, and some reporting actual experiences. synthesises the main
points of discussion in 4 sections, covering' the definition of the concept of
subject specialist and its history; the specialist's functions; implications
for initial and subsequent training of librarians; and implications for the
organisation of university libraries. conclusions relate the anglo-saxon views
to the french situation. full bibliographical details of the articles are

contribution to a thematic issue on library use instruction. reviews some of
the arguments for and against the idea of a teaching function for reference
librarians which have been put forward within the us library profession.
describes the way in which the librarian fulfils his teaching role on a 1 to 1
basis at the reference desk, and by preparing various kinds of user guides.
argues that in school and academic libraries the teaching function of the
librarian must be intensified because of the educational objectives inherent
in these environments. suggests that with decreasing library budgets in the
1980s, librarians, especially those in reference services, will be faced with
justifying their functions and that a suitable way of doing this would be for
the library to become a 'teaching library'.

(phd thesis-texas woman's university.) a general cost effective model is
developed to test staffing patterns in university library reference services.
the model is applicable to any library and provides evaluative data on
alternative staffing strategies for the reference desk. it identifies 3
important factors' patron's classification, frequency of arrivals, and types
of questions asked; number of staff at desk and effect of their skill levels
on fashion of service; and the library's policy concerning the importance of
the reference desk service. the procedure for the model's implementation (to
be carried out by the management) is based on statistical decision theory.

there has been a public library in aachen since 1831. the present building,
opened in 1980, is the result of redeveloping an old textile factory at a cost
of 6.1 million dm. the building offers 6,835 sq.m. of space for 320,000 items,
with over 200 seats for readers, on an ideal site close to schools and the
central bus station. the building is in 4 storeys linked by lifts, with the
administrative department in a separate section. the ground floor contains
issue and information counters, a link with the underground stack, fiction,
children's and teenage libraries, catalogues, inter-library loan, photocopying
and typing facilities; the 1st and 2nd floors house periodicals, special
collections and non-fiction and the 3rd floor the music library, practice

ground floor area, for issue counter, cloakroom and newspapers, is rather
small but the upper storeys are generously proportioned. the 1st floor houses
the children's library, fiction and a meeting-room seating 100 people; a small
audio centre is planned here but ultimately kiel will probably have a separate
music library and audio centre elsewhere. the 2nd floor contains non-fiction,
periodicals, newspaper cuttings, pamphlets, catalogues and information
services. administrative departments are on the 3rd and 4th floors and there

a boundary has been defined as a demarcation line separating an organisation

and from the organisation. using a systems perspective, this cross-sectional
exploratory survey addresses the question: do i&r services, occupants of
boundary positions vis-a-vis social organisations, serve as sources of
information inputs from the environment for country social service agencies?
findings show that i&r data are important sources of information from the
environment for most of the agencies surveyed, dependent not only on
organisational supports but also on feedback processes that encourage
information exchange between organisations and their environment. such
developments must be guided by an understanding of the kinds of questions such

custodians or information service managers. there are many approaches to this
understanding including the historical, social, psychological and

technology in writing and printing have affected scholarship in the past. this

discusses the network approach to specialised documentation and information
centres with particular reference to the present situation of agriculture
information networks in latin american and caribbean countries. the
introduction of network methods requires a corresponding adjustment in
administrative functions if the quality of service to users is to be
maintained. a detailed analysis is presented of the 4 documentation functions
which have changed significantly because of the impact of networking'
collection development, information analysis, access to documentation
resources, and evaluation of information services. examines the administrative
functions which require reconsideration' staffing, budgeting, and management
of information resources, both because of networking and the introduction of
modern technology in management of information systems.

a paper presented at a conference in the philippines in 1979 on communication
responsibilities of the international agricultural research centers (iarcs),
describing the new approach to handling technical information recently
introduced at the international center for tropical agriculture (ciat).
consolidated information is a wholistic approach to information,
communication, and research. details are given of the theoretical basis, with
an outline of services offered at the cassava information center as
illustration. recent theories about information communication, and research
evidence, are adduced as corroboration of the consolidated information
concept, with reference to the literature. in conclusion the method is
recommended to iarcs as a potentially highly efficient approach to information
handling, with important consequences for networking activities.

describes the provincial library system concept in the canadian context and
indicates its potential for growth. the system has developed in response to
needs and opportunities. it may be called a distributed-information-system in
as much as its components, the local libraries, are highly viable and
regularly retrieve, process, and deliver information. local library
cooperative projects have strengthened the system. regional systems within the
provincial system have played a crucial role in strengthening resources,
improving accessibility, and performing central functions. the whole system
has proved to be highly flexible, responsive, and able to provide quality
services at relatively low cost.

monitor would allow the group to spot possible communication barriers and then
determine proper interventions to reduce the barriers, thus providing an

in recent decades there has been a notable expansion of statistical data
produced by the public and private sectors for administrative, research,
policy and evaluation programmes. this is due to advances in relatively
inexpensive and efficient data collection and management of computer-readable
statistical data. corresponding changes have not occurred in the management of
data collection, preservation, description and dissemination. as a result, the
process by which data become accessible to social researchers and others is
frustrating, time consuming, and inefficient. describes the reasons for this
situation' the problem-solving workstyle of social data users, the nature of
the data and their relationship to computer technology, and an inchoate social

a proposed outpatient data collection system is described and compared with
the current system. 4 major advantages of the proposed system are discussed.
1st, the new outpatient data collection system could simplify and reduce
administrative procedures. 2nd, the new data collection system could provide a
tool for assessing the current state of readiness of operational units
throughout the navy. 3rd, this system could be used as a basis for making
predictions concerning staffing and material requirements of any medical
facility under a variety of conditions. finally, the proposed outpatient
system could be tied to the current inpatient system to derive complete
medical histories for individual patients. by merging the 2 data systems a
research tool would be created that could provide investigators with an
unprecedented opportunity to explore the development, distribution, causes,
and prevention of disease.

first hand impressions of problems and experiences in library user education
in the usa and the uk. library user education has become more widespread for
university students but needs to be standardised. it was felt that the
academic level of library user education should be raised and that its

the aim of user training is to develop the ability of the user to make full
use of library stock and facilities. the user must understand the principles
of the classification systems used in the public and trade union libraries. a
group called library work with young people examined the way in which a
brochure introducing young people to library use was being used in practice.
more young people should be involved in user training through increased
cooperation with teachers at training colleges and instructors of apprentices.
user training sessions should be planned to involve young people actively,
taking their special interests into consideration. it is also important that
library staff should keep abreast of current developments in user training
methods and exchange information with other libraries in the district.

and discusses the following aspects of undergraduate education in research
strategies' the level of student to be taught; the content of instruction; the
methods used to teach; and who should teach. uses examples from the social
sciences to illustrate some of the points made in these discussions. concludes

thus obtained do not support the current model relating to the identifying of
users and uses of sdi services, and expose the model and its theoretical
framework as being too narrow, excluding several segments of the user
community. develops an alternative model based on mass communication theory

rgues that much reference work is based on inadequate and outdated reference
material leading to wrong answers to queries. for this reason a project aimed
at building up a regional information centre at the regional library in kalmar
was initiated. the aim was to achieve a well selected reference stock in all
libraries according to size and need, effective use of these aids and of the
regional library's reference section. a precondition of this is a well
functioning telephone service. in order to coordinate and improve information
supply to the individual, plans should be made for information activity within
a municipality and region which include training of reference librarians, and
the library should be more widely advertised as a source of information.

an in-house library system, based on a dedicated minicomputer, has been in
operation in israel's national medical library since summer 79. the integrated
system, called maimon, features on-line access to bibliographic and
circulation records. it replaces manual cataloguing, searching, lending, and
reservations. it provides previously-unavailable statistics on items in heavy
use and demand, items to be removed from the active collection, and who uses
what in the library. it is designed to be user-friendly and to save users'
time. it has been very favourably received by patrons and frees professional
staff from time-consuming routine clerical tasks. the system is evaluated in

analyses the different organisational structures and areas of responsibility
of serials departments, looking in particular at the current practices in
australian tertiary libraries. in most libraries, the organisational structure
appears to be based on factors such as historical accidents, special
circumstances, personnel arrangements, or architectural constraints, and not
on any administrative decision taken on the basis of an understanding of the
special factors involved in serials work. with shrinking budgets reinforcing
the trend towards library cooperation and automation, libraries will need to
review their organisational structures to suit future technology.

libraries exercise over what is included in their collections. the findings
and conclusions of the study are based upon interviews with library
administrators and acquisitions librarians at middlebury college, bowdoin,
colby, bates, wellesley, amherst, trinity, hamilton, union, and colgate. these
colleges were chosen because of thier similarities of purpose, staff size,
student enrollment, faculty, number of library volumes added annually, library
budgets, and library holdings. chapters identify the objectives of the study,

books and 136 journals, it is intended as a selection guide for small- or
medium-sized medical libraries. books and journals are listed separately by
subject. there is an author index, and an alphabetical journal title listing.
to purchase all the books and pay annual subscriptions for all the journals
would cost about $30,000. to acquire the 137 books and 54 journals recommended
for initial purchase by smaller libraries would cost about $8,900. for the

attitudes over the last 20 years as reflected in the fiction; and help
librarians to determine whether 20-year-old fiction contains attitudes with
which today's readers can relate. by studying adolescent psychology and

as sources of funding for us medical rare book libraries. characteristics of
the medical rare book library and of friends groups were examined to identify
those which are correlated with successful friends groups. correlations were
found between the amount of money contributed by the friends group and the age

the controversial question as to whether publishers should be legally required
to supply depository copies free of charge to libraries is once again being
discussed in west germany. some publishers in baden-wurttemberg challenged
this requirement and took their case before the federal constitutional court.
an amended law was passed in baden-wurttemberg as a result of this action
whereby publishers are still required to supply 1 copy free of charge but can
be recompensed for up to 50% of their costs for any further copies. in the
light of the constitution delivering depository copies is to be seen as a
social duty directly linked to property ownership. the publisher has a duty to
the public to supply libraries with current literature but a balance must be
struck between this and the financial limits of the publisher.

contribution to a section devoted to planning interlending systems for
developing countries. an interlending system is vital for the development and
support of literacy, education and research, and of industry and the economy
generally. interlending takes place in bangladesh between certain groups of
libraries but progress is hampered by the lack of a strong national library to
give leadership in shared acquisition and interlending policies. another
problem arises because different types of library come under different
government departments, with no coordination agency. progress will depend on
systematic cooperation between libraries.

contribution to a section devoted to planning interlending systems for
developing countries. factors that influence library planning in brazil
include its large size, its very young population, its struggling
semi-industrialised economy, the uneven level of education, and low levels of
research activity and publishing output. modernisation means that the demand
for documents is potentially very large. document supply will be organised
through different economic or administrative sectors, such as agriculture,
energy, or education. however, these will need to be coordinated to avoid gaps
or unnecessary duplication in subject coverage, and some degree of
centralisation is desirable.

nasa centre libraries, and the characteristics of a system that would best
supply those products and services were assessed. emphasis was placed on
determining the most cost effective means of meeting nasa's requirements for
an automated book system. various operating modes were examined including the
current stims file, the pubfile, developing software improvements for products
as appropriate to the centre needs, and obtaining cataloguing and products
from the bibliographic utilities including at least oclc, rlin, bna, and stif.

the principles for the preservation and restoration of library collections are
set out by the members of the standing committee of ifla's preservation
section. the aim of the principles is to increase library staff's awareness of
the necessity of preserving and restoring not only archive material but also
contemporary literature collections. the most important principle is that of
suitable storage facilities. most common forms of damage occur through
unstable climatic conditions, incorrect lighting, dust, biological causes
(micro-organisms and insects) and chemical causes (oxidation and hydrolysis of
the cellulose). to protect original material, copies should be lent to the
user whenever possible. restoration should only be carried out when it is
unavoidable. every step of the restoration process should be documented as
librarians should realise that even expert restoration can lead to
falsification and distortion of the original .

spot checks after bums was established showed losses of 4% annually, or 10,000
volumes. introduction of a theft prevention system was combined with a new
computer check-out system. after study visits, the checkpoint by-pass system
was found most suitable for a public library of gothenburg's size. a metal

iscusses a report by a danish working party on catalogue products, published
in 1980, and compares the danish and swedish solutions. the proposed danish
system can be described as a mixture of libris and bums and considerable
central guidance by the library centre is assumed. the working party seems to
have little faith in the ability of individual libraries to catalogue
according to the norms, for it proposes that central libraries help the
smaller libraries with the decentralised input. the costs of this system are,
however, high, and the swedish system, where the library service catalogues
from photocopied title pages those titles not found in the central data base,
is preferable. criticises the report for not carrying out economic costing of
the implementation of the standard specifications. the report exaggerates the
costs of producing local catalogues in printed form and neglects to consider
use of modern technology, e.g. laser printers, for this production.

the role of the location mark in library and information processes is examined
under the following headings' the location mark as a kind of information
retrieval language; the basic functions of the location mark; the location
mark in the processing and dissemination of information sources (acquisition,
storage, and retrieval of documents). the importance of the location mark is
particularly stressed for those libraries that are planning automation.

no historical national bibliography for german literature exists; instead
great importance is placed on the bibliographical works compiled by heinsius
and kayser in the 18th century. these are widely used as reference
bibliographies and the validity of their entries is rarely questioned.
heinsius and kayser based their catalogues on bibliographies published by the
book trade such as exhibition catalogues. these were often incomplete and did
not include reprints or new editions. there are many examples of incorrect
references in the catalogues and a complete study of the works of heinsius and
kayser is necessary to determine what is reliable reference material and what
is not. a guide to using the catalogues which listed the changing
relationships in the book trade noting which publisher was taken over, by whom
and when would also be invaluable in the work of following up bibliographical
references.

microcatalogues are being introduced into many libraries in usa, uk,
switzerland and west germany. their advantages include' small size; the
possibility of making any number of copies; relatively small costs and speed
of copying. the use of microcatalogues demands a large number of users who
must become acquainted with this new form of catalogue searching.
microcatalogues are being tested in order to learn the conditions under which
they are most efficient.

discusses the respective advantages of the 'letter by letter' and 'word by

of how students and children sequence words and retrieve items from indexes
with different sequences. concludes that students use a variety of methods
when asked to put words in order for an index, with sense and meaning being a
prime consideration. schoolchildren, however, were found to be less ambitious
in this respect, and to order words alphabetically using the letter by letter
method. no 1 method of sequencing indexes was found to lead to better
retrieval than any of the others used, and it appears that either of the 2
methods currently used by indexers can be employed without causing undue
difficulty for young readers.

examines indexes as a source of general information about the indexed
material. defines the concepts of index-entry, index-base and index and
concludes that an index is a group of data and subjects which the indexer
deemed significant and as expressing the content of the indexed material.
given an ideal indexer, the size of an index may serve as a measurement of the
amount of information in the indexing-base. since perfect indexes do not
exist, a careful evaluation of a concordance by vocabulary size and word
occurrence could provide an estimate. evaluation must be done very carefully
in relation to content, discipline and type of indexed terms.

flexible. the evaluation of notations, carried out with an example, is done
with a quite comprehensive catalogue of desiderata. for design decisions, the
methods of worth analysis are recommended, especially when considering whether
or not to employ notation at all. another possibility is to use notational

(phd thesis-university of pittsburgh). examines the see also reference
structures (syndetic structures) of 3 subject access systems used in
medicine-precis, mesh, and lcsh. explores their differences and similarities
in an effort to develop the best possible structure using features of all 3. 3
variables were evaluated-subject area coverage, browseability, and
flexibility. maps were developed for the subject headings in each system and
compared with maps developed from recognised 'classic' textbooks; this
procedure readily identified gaps in coverage and inconsistencies in
terminology control. such maps could be converted to computer displays to

the feasibility of providing precis with extra facilities to enable it to
function as a system for switching indexing data between 2 or more natural
languages was investigated. lexicons were established in 3 languages, and a
'pivot file' created to link them. routines for switching indexing terms out
of a given source language and into a chosen target language were devised and
set down in the form of flow-charts or algorithms. using these algorithms,
precis strings were switched mainly between english, french, and german.
problems of translation were solved by the use of 'lexical blocks' and the
adoption of a system of categories. mechanisms for the automatic provision of
articles in french and german strings were designed. 2 methods of providing
inflected forms of nouns by algorithm were tested in german and polish. the
use of 'substitute' phrases in precis was investigated, and procedures for the
automatic provision and construction of phrases in a target language were
devised. algorithms designed to build prepositional or adjectival phrases were
tested on english, french, and german precis strings.

discusses a thesis by j. luef' storage and retrieval of information in
industrial concerns, presented to the danish technical university. the problem
of how knowledge which is important for selection of material for
constructions, for example, can best be described in data form is now
internationally recognised with the creation of the international council of
scientific unions' committee for scientific and technical data. luef
distinguishes between retrieval of references and of data; very detailed
specifications are needed to describe physical objects so that they can be
referred to in a system. he studies the area of anticipative intelligence,
i.e. the possibility of creating new solutions to a problem and thereby
increase innovation within the firm. the theoretical discussions are soundly
based on practical experience and he regards the process of retrieval as a
tool to be used by the decision-maker. the thesis has sections on software and
 hardware, including discussion of the role of man in the search process. the
2nd part concerns practical system design in 4 concerns and description of a
demonstration system dart (data analysis, retrieval and taxonomy), with

paper presented at the international workshop on chinese library automation,
taipei, taiwan, 14-19 feb 81. considers the rapid evolution of mass storage
technology and its influence on file organisation. technological advances have
made what seemed impractical in 1971 become eminently practical in 1981 and
librarians must thus examine the technological environment to determine which
of their perceived limitations are real and which are illusory and soon to be
smashed. this examination is perhaps most essential for mass storage file
organisation as this has the most marked and long-lasting effect on the
performance of automated bibliographic systems.

the retrieval of information from an inverted file requires access to both
index and data blocks. heuristic techniques to reduce the number of data block
accesses are presented, and can be reorganised concurrently with normal user
activities. previous work on interrelated record clustering techniques is
described. methods for the partial reorganisation of data files are described
and compared with the total sort method, using an artificial randomly
generated file. methods described are sorting in order of the catenated key
formed from the attibutes, reordering a set of adjacent blocks, and the local
optimum, partial sort and care methods for selecting the cluster; sorting gave
the best results, but is not suitable for on-line reorganisation. partial
methods favour an increase in the buffer size, and the distance function is
more effective for selecting a cluster, where the attributes have many values.

an architectural approach is outlined, to fulfil the need for an integrated
data base communication system able to support any user in any network node,
without incurring mass migration of data. a global query translator processes
queries into a global conceptual model of information content, and a global
internal model of data to form an access-path oriented model of the structure
of the integrated system. sub-queries are formed using a query decomposer and
access path selectors, and are translated into the data base language. the
role of layers and mappings in the proposed architecture is defined between
the virtual model and the local physical data base. the entity-relationship
and diam-sddt models are described and compared with general data base
management systems. an example of an integrated network heterogenous data base
is followed by a description of inter-data base relationships in the unified

since the 1970s on-line data bases covering a variety of subjects have started
to be installed in academic libraries. these libraries should be considering
how data bases can be used now and in the future to improve their service
programme structure. most data bases cannot be used directly by library users
and specially trained staff are necessary. it is also important to
differentiate between the massive range of information services now available.
the introduction of data bases providing immediate access to literature
references means that methods of increasing the speed of access to the
literature itself should also be developed.

data base and conducting laboratory research' the crucial process in both is
seen as phrasing the question to the system to obtain meaningful and useful
results. argues that the searcher must act as an intermediary for the library
user in questioning the data base-for this reason every effort must be made to
maximise the efficiency with which a query is transferred from requestor to
searcher. presents a checklist of areas to be covered in an interview for a

documents requested from computer data bases. source documents are converted
to computer readable form, either as text or as facsimile. the former can be
printed on a teleprinter, but does not preserve all the format of the
original; the latter can be delivered to a facsimile receiver. the digitised
documents are stored in data bases attached to host computers. from these,
they can be retrieved in response to user's request and sent overnight via
euronet or another telecommunications network to the user's unattended
terminal or to his computer for later printing.

the german library's national bibliographic data bank is called biblio-data
(bd). bd consists of a data base; german bibliography (deutsche bibliographie)
and the ibm full text dialogue system, stairs (storage and information
retrieval system). bd aids the classification department of the german library
in many ways' it makes research in various locations unnecessary and
concentrates the entire process of information retrieval in one place; it
provides a multidimensional classification system with access to many general
and specialised catalogues which were not available in such a complete and
efficient form before; it provides a means of locating material of which only
fragments of the title are known as it is able to combine unspecific pieces of
search information very rapidly; also it is no longer necessary to deal with
an increasing number of monthly or quarterly registers as bd acts as a
continuous processer updating the complete mass of title  material.

results showed that speed and understanding do not change in parallel. up to a
critical point they follow each other; thereafter further increases in speed
are accompanied by decreases in understanding. this critical point can be used
as an index of reading ability for any given reader. libraries should promote

a study of biochemistry and molecular biology journal prices for 1967-79 is
presented. results show that these journals are comparable in cost to physics
and chemistry journals, previously found most costly. when weighted averages
are compared, these journals are the most expensive for which price data are
available in the usa. a small number of highly cited journals account for
nearly 50% of the cost of the entire list of 83 journals studied-a fact which
has serious implications for the management of journal collections. the need
for government subsidies to academic libraries for the purchase of scientific
journals is reiterated.

a survey of dual pricing practices among publishers of health-related journals
identified 281 periodicals with an average price differential of over 100%
between individual and institutional subscription rates. both the practice
itself and the amount of the differential are increasing, indicating that
journal subscriptions of health sciences libraries increasingly provide the
necessary financial support for the publication of health sciences journals.
dual pricing is also correlated with copyright royalties. problems created for
health sciences libraries' budgets by dual pricing are partly due to
uncritical purchasing by libraries. recommends increased consumerism on the
part of health science librarians.

the 1981 fair illustrated the miserable nature of present-day publishing but
was a true picture of children's literature, 80% of which consists of comics,
picture-books and coloured books, all in poor taste. children's books in
general are at a low level-the tv screen in book form-and the question is
whether colours and pictures sell whereas culture does not. scandinavian book
production differs markedly from that of other countries in variety, breadth
and well-defined taste but is in an obviously scandinavian style. the 1981
bologna fair was dull, with little new or outstandingly interesting, and
business also appeared to be poor and mostly concerned with joint
book-production in different countries. joint production enables danish
publishers to issue quality picture books but also has increasingly become the
means by which danish books can appear in other countries.

should be willing to handle the information services now being published by
many sections of industry and commerce and also other publications now not
normally found in bookshops. discusses the effects of the electronic book, or
'pocket reader'. this medium will be especially suitable for small edition
publications, reserving printing for large editions now already being sold in

reports on a conference on the road ahead for libraries, organised by the
group of chief librarians and held in feb 81. the plight of authors and
booksellers was dealt with by a publisher and an author in talks on the
possibilities and future production of the book in relation to the libraries
of the 80s. other subjects covered by civil servants in local authorities
were' conditions for and claims on the senior civil servant in the 80s;
cooperation and communication between civil servants and politicians, and
civil servants' right of free expression. a survey of library development in
denmark since 1909 was given by librarians. r. lysholt hansen was resigned to
the fact that the research libraries did not wish to enter into a joint
directorate, but argued that some way of securing fair resource distribution
should be found. the final subject of discussion was' provision and management
in the libraries of tomorrow, when the  right balance between centralisation,
necessary in a time of cuts, and individuality was debated.

the official 1977-unesco statistics show that, as far as numbers of libraries
and librarians, and also annual acquisitions per head of population, are
concerned, bulgaria lies in the 7th and 4th places respectively in the world.
however, bulgaria takes the 14th and 19th places in loans and in turnover of
current book collections. thus, higher efficiency required in all fields of
the nation's life by the recent 12th congress of the bulgarian communist party
must also be aimed for in libraries and information centres. great attention
must be paid in particular to scientific and other special libraries which
need to cope not only with the present information explosion, but also with
soaring prices of western publications and bulgaria's limited foreign currency
resources. amongst other problems are the education and training of
librarians, the needs in new library buildings, mechanisation, automation, and
updating of library management. the cyril and methodius national library, not
only as keeper of the national literary heritage, but also as the most
important library and information centre in the whole country, is, in itself,
a special case. it should be relieved of some of its problems on the occasion
of the 1300th anniversary of the bulgarian state.

the same intense sense of urgency that surrounded the word 'energy' in the
late 1970s was felt in connection with the word 'efficiency' in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries. efficiency was felt to be the key to putting into
order the chaos resulting from the technological/industrial revolution. the
publication of frederick w. taylor's 2principles of scientific management1 in
1911 is often erroneously cited as the beginning of the efficiency craze.

international level as it provides an opportunity to deal with various aspects
of national library development and international cooperation with special
emphasis on the efficiency of library organisations, professional methodical
centres and national service facilities for libraries. about 1,200 people are
expected to attend the conference which wil be the largest cultural event yet

standards have an important role in the implementation of new technology and
the improving of economic efficiency. their relevance in librarianship
includes improving reader services, maximising use of resources, accounting
procedures and interlibrary cooperation. in 1976-78 existing standards
relating to libraries were revised and coordinated and a long-term programme
of standardisation covering information work, librarianship and publishing was
initiated. aspects of librarianship affected by standards introduced since
then include' the bibliographical description of music and maps, reference
books in service points, basic terms and definitions in scientific information
work, and a single national system of inter-library loans.

one of the special bibliographies published by the cyril and methodius

information science. from 1967-76, 4330 headings were listed. more than 90%
were articles and special papers, and only the remaining 10% included books.
national dailies as well as regional and local papers also paid attention to
libraries. they emphasised, however, mostly general issues or topics of local
interest and timing frequency as well as standards varied considerably. since
1954, 2bibliotekar1 has been almost the only stable periodical for librarians
and has so far remained the only bulgarian periodical of this kind known and
abstracted abroad. information scientists have lacked their own special
periodical. the gap has been partly filled by the effort of the central

a reading of the available documents on the international information system
on research in documentation (isorid), a joint unesco-fid operation, reveals
that the system has met as yet unresolved stresses that hinder the effective
contribution to the world community that this system was expected to make. a
quantitative comparison with the us-based 2library and information services
today1 (list) is not kind to isorid and reflects the degree of difficulty that
isorid has with its essentially cooperative basis for gathering data. the
theoretical basis for an international register appears sound, but
practicalities are hindering its effectiveness to the fields of documentation,
information science, and librarianship.

interviews judith f. krug, leader of the american library association's office
for intellectual freedom. its work is based on the first amendment of the u.s.
constitution and on the ala's library bill of rights. it began as the
intellectual freedom committee in 1940. until recently almost all cases came
from school libraries, but since the reagan administration took office the
most important cases originate with the public libraries. the office, however,
does not confine itself to taking up cases within the library sector, but it
keeps librarians and the public informed of the importance of the first
amendment, issues publications, and holds seminars. many attempts at
censorship come from the moral majority movement. the office finds it easier
to deal with libraries which have a clearly formulated selection policy, and
in very few cases does it recommend refusal to acquire a particular book. the
legal side of ala is dealt with by a separate,  but related body, the freedom
to read foundation.

information science and technology1 from 1966-75, for evidence of the
developing intellectual structure of the discipline of information science.
this structure is viewed as being composed of the concepts which form the
intellectual territory of the discipline and their organisation into topics
research areas and sub-fields. a primary function of review literature is seen
to be the mapping of the intellectual structure of the discipline. examines
concepts underlying authors' natural language. attempts to produce a model of

using the universal model of transformation of information and through
structure of data from the point of view of the theory of reflection, the
similarities and differences between primary, secondary and tertiary
information are outlined. according to whether the symbol is a reflection of
phenomena or a reflection of a symbol (sign), various orders of the reflection
are recognised, i.e. the order of the symbol reflection. thus primary
information is a reflection of a phenomenon deposited without a sign/mark,
secondary information is a reflection of the deposited signs, etc. the
statement giving the space and time in which a phenomenon is valid is called
the address.

the career of a librarian should combine the practical side of librarianship
with academic knowledge and research. nowadays new research in library science
is usually carried out in teams rather than by individuals. modern librarians
have to possess a wide range of knowledge covering many fields and it is no
longer usual for a librarian to be an expert in only 1 subject. teachers at
library schools are often part-time librarians and provide students with an
understanding of daily library activity, which prevents courses from becoming
merely theoretical. the changing structure of academic libraries is reflected
in the syllabuses of library schools which devote more time to current library
and information science subjects than before.

new zealander john harris (1903-80) arrived in nigeria in 1948 to be librarian
of the fledgeling university college, ibadan. he almost single-handedly
created nigeria's premier academic press and, with his wife, its 1st
university bookshop. he played a major role in forming the west african
library association and initiated the 1st formal library education course in
nigeria. thanks largely to him, the 1st library school in nigeria, the

although national guidelines were drawn up on librarianship training, each
west german state is responsible for its own education system, therefore
considerable variations still exist concerning legal status of library
schools, entry requirements, curricula for compulsory and optional subjects
and organisation of courses for public and academic librarians. some subjects
are not taught at all in some schools and generally related subjects are split
up too much. many lecturers place too much emphasis on formal lectures' many
students are uninterested in their studies. training courses must develop
students' critical faculties, encourage creativity and promote active
communication with readers and cooperation with other institutions; better

report of discussion at a weekend seminar, stuttgart, jan 81. many students
have financial problems and difficulties in finding accommodation but,
compared with other courses, few drop out and student-staff relationships are
good. librarianship studies should develop critical faculties and the ability
to make contact with readers. the library must become a communication centre,
up to date and open to outside influences. regional needs should be emphasised
rather than national standardisation. librarianship courses should contain new
fields of study, like social and communication sciences. some formal lectures
should be replaced by small study groups, examination procedures should be
improved and better use made of practical training periods.

reactions of librarians to recent proposals (taking account of the 1976-77
reports on possible elevation to university status) for a new curriculum in
the norwegian state library school. points covered include the proposed 2-year
common course, with specialisation in the 3rd year (generally approved);
methods subjects (bibliography is considered necessary, but some consider
computer studies nowadays equally essential); literature and society (thought
to merit more attention, especially children's literature, popular literature,
and services to handicapped and immigrants); information science (should be
included in 2 or even 3 years); administration (considered absolutely
essential); practical training (should probably be extended); evaluation of
students' work (general opinion favours the retention of marking together with
continuous evaluation); lecturing staff (library experience is preferred to
academic specialisation); intake of stud ents (as far as possible should cover
the whole country). better liaison on education between school and library
profession is felt desirable, but there seems no major disagreement between
the curriculum committee and librarians in the field.

a norwegian state library school student rebuts 3 claims made by previous
writers (special section on library education in norway, 2ibid1 46 (8) 1979;
2see1 81/60)' (1) that lecturers have too little practical library experience
(&h have extensive library experience, while the others maintain contact with
current library practice); (2) that the course contains too little practical
training (the new 3-year theoretical curriculum is a step forward. internal
and external practical work, though still necessary, are of limited value in a
constantly developing national library system. the school's primary task is to
educate independent, critical librarians who can evaluate their role in a
sociological perspective and be open to development and change); and (3) that
instruction is too theoretical (on the contrary, there is a tendency to
over-value diligence and hard work, viewing librarianship as a service
industry rather than a scholarly discipline). a more library /sociological-
and project-oriented curriculum is needed, calling for a different type of
commitment from both students and lecturers.

teaching. although abolition is not suggested in denmark, much in the letter

their non-commercial objectives can counteract the predominance of large
foreign record companies. it argues that now that music departments in
libraries are being reduced, librarians should receive more instruction in
music librarianship so that they can make better use of the limited resources.
now when the training is to be revised, the opportunity should be grasped to
give music a higher priority in the library school.

novels to genres with the aim of supplying alternatives to substandard
literature (such as morgan kane) was seen as being particularly useful. the
art of skimming through a book and grasping its essentials was practised.
study of book reviews revealed that evaluations of the same book can differ
widely. aids to book selection (especially important to rural librarians with

compared with the usa, uk and the scandinavian states france has awakened from
its dream late to try to develop an up-to-date librarianship. in recent years
development has been significant. this is evidenced by the 5-story centre
georges pompidou inaugurated in 1976. it is a complex of museum, library,
bookshop, record shop, cinemas, theatre, concert hall, i.e. a kind of cultural
centre. after an account of the bibliotheque nationale, describes the central
library of the paris medical university, which has 2 parts-an older and an
up-to-date holding. observing critically, the library of the paris medical
university falls behind the more mechanised us ones but the libraries of
hungarian medical universities have still a great deal of work to do to reach

10th century chronicles tell how many russian princes enjoyed book-collecting
and founded schools. an 11th century chronicle describes the 1st russian
library's creation, the yaroslav library, containing about 500 volumes. our
ancestors read devotional books, lives of the saints, encyclopaedic works, and
geography. the kievo-pecherskii monastery in kiev had a large collection of
russian and greek books. a collection of ryazan literature at the nikola
church in zaraisk evidences the wide dissemination of culture. half of all
surviving 11th to 14th century russian books come from novgorod. the sofiiskoi
cathedral library in novgorod attracted monks from distant russian monasteries

comments on the annual report of the danish research library association
(danmarks forskningsbiblioteksforenings) given by palle birkelund, the
national librarian. danish research libraries are not given the support from
the state in the economic crisis which they receive in sweden. he expressed
fears that the proposed library act, far from creating unity within the danish
library service, would emphasise the division between research libraries under
the cultural ministry and those under the education ministry. he hoped that
the cultural minister would not be unduly influenced by the danish library
association when formulating the library act related to research libraries.
instead of attacking them for lack of openness to the public the minister
should see that economic barriers to their activities are removed.

the 76 french central lending libraries, comparable with the german state
library centres, are administered by the ministry of culture and
communication. each library contains a garage for the mobile libraries, book
stores, offices and multi-purpose rooms for committee meetings, conferences
and staff training sessions. large book stocks averaging 300,000 volumes lead
to space shortages. staff include both state employees and volunteers. help
for culturally underprivileged areas is provided by' direct loan to the public
from mobile libraries; deposit loan in factories, schools, youth clubs,
holiday resorts and old people's homes; organisation of book-oriented
activities. the central lending libraries' work reflects the current tendency

a young librarian challenges his colleagues to question the attitude that they
have held towards their work until now. public libraries are at present in a
blind alley. librarians have forgotten that books are not simply the sources
of certain ideas' they are also goods subject to the laws of marketing, hence
the predominance of best-sellers and trivial material on the market. it is
wrong to value the ability to read above that of playing football; what is
vital is discrimination and sensitivity towards the actual contents of the
material read. librarians are after all responsible for all their actual and
potential readers, by whom their work is financed.

argues that danish public libraries are no longer follow the democratic
tradition of anglo-saxon libraries, nor do they respond to the new signals
coming from the uk and the usa, where the social importance of libraries and
the need for coordination of library services are stressed and where it is
felt that libraries as arsenals of knowledge have the solution to man's global
problems. in sweden too there is a tendency towards a unified library system.
insists that all library types should be democratically controlled under 1
ministry; the separatist attitude of research libraries is therefore
regrettable. libraries should define their users more broadly, now that the
educational level of the population has risen and users need material at all
levels. economic cuts necessitate a unified system to distribute resources.
use of the new information technology in libraries is a question of the
survival of the democratic library, it can revolutionise rural life an d
education. it is society through its democratic institutions which must decide
whether information is to be a public, democratically controlled, or a private
concern.

self-sufficiency, which can make it seem isolated politically and
economically. the public library structure consists of the national library
and 26 central, district, libraries. the latter coordinate local library
activities. the national library in tirana, with 800,000 volumes, has, like
other public libraries, mainly technical, scientific, political and economic
works, and receives 15 copies of each book published in albania. it runs a
2-year course in librarianship. describes visits to libraries in tirana and
fier and to the university library in tirana, founded in 1957, with 550,000

followed by children's books (25,7%) and books on arts (24,7%). circulation
and book processing methods are also discussed. 1 of the main functions of the
library is the provision of methodological guidance to smaller libraries in
its area including town, village and school libraries. this is done through
library seminars and the publication of methodological materials. practical
help is provided by librarians-methodologists who travel to the smaller

library services to promote educational opportunities and to provide
information for the cultural and recreational development of the individual.
in 1974 the ministry of education and culture created the national centre for
library services to supervise the carrying out of this programme. in the last
5 years a network of libraries has been set up throughout the country,
including 19 regional library centres and a new national library, and 2,000

since tanzania became independent in 1961 the library system has been
developed as an integral part of the education system. in 1963 the library
services board act was passed which led to the national central library in dar

is the headquarters of the tanzania library services. from this centre other
libraries were planned, firstly in the district towns, then on a smaller scale
in rural areas. converted lorries served as mobile libraries in rural areas at
first. the total stock of public libraries still only totals 900,000 for a
population of 17,000,000. a university library was founded in dar es salaam in
1961. at present complete training facilities for library staff are not

most state library centres, except those in bavaria, now have to face
financial restrictions, just at a time when increases in stocks and services
are badly needed. everything that library centres hoped for seems threatened.
the german tendency towards perfection applies to medium-sized rather than to
small organisations. the increased use of non-book media has changed the
centres' role. the centres have played an invaluable part in developing rural
library services but their golden age is now past. library policy could be
altered, however, through the performance of the centres' tasks by regional
library associations. these associations should be formed in areas where none
exist; based on a constitution worked out by local politicians, they can work
towards improving service quality.

report of the conference held in sept/oct 81, with a central theme of
literature provision for rural areas. subjects covered included' the
foreseeable and unforeseeable aspects of library planning; the tasks and
functions of public libraries at different levels of spatial planning; and
literature provision within rural cultural development. warnings were given
against emergency solutions provided without professional expertise and
against resignation in the face of difficulties. a broadly based,
decentralised lending system should cater for both general and specialised
requirements. the state should support and complement local library services
but refrain from excessive interference in them. bavaria is the state that has
made most progress in this direction; its state development programme reflects
the importance of systematic planning.

describes the vatican library. despite numerous plunders and dispersals of the
collections the library has grown under the care of many library cardinals and
popes. thus on the death of pope nicholas v in 1455 it contained europe's
largest manuscript collection. the official foundation was laid with sixtus
iv's bull in 1475, the collection was organised in 4 parts, and the 1st
catalogue appeared in 1485. a liberal lending policy was stopped for all time
by sixtus v, who also had the present building erected in 1588. expansion
forced the library to occupy rooms other than the original sistine saloon. the
20th century has seen modernisation of the building and of administrative and
library techniques. the library contains among many precious manuscripts the
collection belonging to queen christina of sweden. cataloguing of manuscripts,
incunabula and printed books has been going on since the 15th century.

discusses attempts to make public libraries more accessible to handicapped
people in the usa. changes in the laws have encouraged the making of all
public buildings accessible to the handicapped. this has led to new standards
for building and the renovation of old buildings some of which have required
considerable work. the new laws have caused controversy in small towns with
few, if any, handicapped people over who should pay for renovation work.
concludes that clearer guidelines should be established to make the law more
flexible and to guarantee that small town buildings such as libraries are in
compliance with specific alternative services. the federal government should
also consider providing funding for accessibility renovations.

undertakes all selection of material to be transferred to braille print,
flexible discs or, mostly, to 4 track cassette tapes. these are issued mainly
by post through the 56 regional libraries and their 102 branches. some
regional libraries also organise recordings of local material by volunteers,
but the one in new york has had to curtail its services. 4 multi-state centres
act as service centres for the regional libraries. private library services to

school libraries and media centres vary widely in size, quality of service,

number of registered library users below the age of 18 has increased by 93%

despite development of public libraries in west germany, private workplace
libraries remain important. there are 250 of these with 1 1/2 million volumes

organisation justifies the library by its usefulness to the firm and refers to
an article by muth (the reader as a factor of productivity in the firm), in
which he argues that the aim of the library is to develop and maintain the
ability to read, as efficient readers mean workers with high mobility, and

the history of the workers' libraries in germany falls into 3 periods. the 1st
libraries came into existence between 1836-1889. from 1890-1914/18 rapid
development took place. 1918-1933 the libraries began to decline, were
integrated with public libraries and many destroyed in the literary purge of
1933. the libraries in the potsdam district dated from the 2nd period and were
all destroyed in 1933. the 1st workers' library was in rathenow and grew from
210 books in 1899 to a stock of 6,000 in the 1920s. the central workers'
library in brandenburg existed from 1902-1933.

the st. pauli district of hamburg is a socially underprivileged area where
slum clearance is taking place. in 1980, library stocks totalled 20,000
volumes of which 800 are turkish literature provided for the many foreign
residents; there are also games and german and turkish cassettes. the book
turnover is below the average for hamburg libraries. since many adult
residents either understood little german or are confused by the library's
technical procedures, few of them use the library. local children tend to use
the library as a meeting-place, which causes noise but does provide somewhere
to play. the librarian, moving away from purely traditional librarianship,
works closely with local social workers, visiting families to discuss problems
and allowing them to use the library for meetings; this helps to integrate the
library into the community.

a german librarian records her impressions of this london borough's library
work with foreign minority groups, including west indians, africans, indians
and people of mixed race. since 5 different indian languages are spoken in
brent, all library notices are published in them as well as in english. the
traditional form of municipal library, comprising a central library with
branches closely dependent upon it, seemed no longer suitable for this
community. a large degree of autonomy was therefore given to each branch
library, helping it to cater better for the special needs of its district.
books are lent to youth and sports clubs and activities organised for
different ethnic groups. intensive training is provided for library staff on
the history, culture and contemporary problems of the african, asian and
caribbean races.

there are 346 public libraries in the turgovishche region. (north-east
bulgaria) with collections of more than 1 1/2 million volumes, i.e. about 9
books per head of the population. each reader borrows, on average, almost 13
books every year. 1/3 of the 171,000 inhabitants in the area are turks catered
for by 47 librarians. after literacy courses and reading aloud in the early
post-war years, the librarians' efforts can now be geared to attracting
readers from every family. libraries are helped by clubs of young friends of
books as well as by other organisations. discussions on significant works of
literature and other events are arranged by the libraries to encourage the
turkish population to attain a higher standard of living and to take pride in
their socialist homeland. results of the concerted efforts can be demonstrated
most tangibly in the changed life of turkish women. veiled in the recent past,
they work now, not only in agriculture, bu t in many other fields. they also
sing in mixed choirs and appear on the stage. however, as the knowledge of the
bulgarian language has become more widespread among the turks in bulgaria, the
reading of books in turkish has followed a progressive downward trend.

foreign workers have made a positive contribution towards west german
prosperity but our society is ill prepared for the acuteness of the problems
facing foreign children and young people. their educational deprivation is
grounded above all in their inferior social position. foreign children should
experience a socialisation process which will enable them to be integrated
into german society and re-integrated into the society of their native land,
for which they must grow up to be both bilingual and bicultural. the library
should be the foreign citizens' centre for information, communication and

librarians know little about the views of foreign workers and their families
on libraries; many of these people understand little german. in july 80 munich
municipal library produced a questionnaire for turkish children, including
questions on age, sex, schools and types of class, length of time in germany,
ability to read german, library use and likes and dislikes concerning books,
cassettes and library facilities. language problems led to some
misunderstandings; the design of future questionnaires must be improved.
results showed that the average reader is 10-13 years old, male, in a turkish
class at school and can read some german books. he came to germany within the
last 4 years, learnt about the library from friends, has a reader's ticket and

for many library users, the librarian is an integral part of any search
strategy. an observational study was conducted to explore the possible effects
of 1 communication variable, communication apprehension (ca), the fear of
talking, on the user's decision to search a library independently or with the
librarian's assistance. it was found that respondents, regardless of ca level,
behaved similarly in searching a library when measured in terms of initial
step, number of steps, and length of search time. ca was eliminated as a
variable influencing the initiation of an interaction with a librarian.
further research is needed to determine its possible effects once that

increasing involvement of bulgaria's institutions and individual scientists

continuous updating of the relevant collections. the publications are, at
least partly, available to the users in open access departments and/or in

nevertheless, it is desirable that the acquisition departments pay even closer
attention to reference publications. compilation of a general catalogue of all

however, maps were printed in vienna. another step forward was the liberation
from turkish rule (1878), followed by the foundation of various national
institutions, headed by the state national geographical institute (1891) and

paper given at the swedish library association's annual meeting. describes
technical developments in the video field, which are likely to lead to an
abundance of pictures competing on our tv screens. this situation has both
problems and possibilities. the output of video cassettes consists mainly of
low quality action films and the delay in the plans for distribution of
swedish tv programmes, which should heighten the quality, is regrettable. but
the new distribution system also offers new freedom of choice and independence
of transmission times. video techniques are useful for minorities such as the
deaf and immigrants. the videogram commission therefore recommends that
libraries should show video films, lend them and transmit them via cable.

purposes. only 1 library has taken up the offer of deposit of video cassettes
from the state film centre. refers to various reports which make it clear that
video is a material which properly belongs in a public library and can be
acquired with public money. the desirability of having radio and tv programmes
available for loan in public libraries has often been pointed out, but this
would necessitate changes in the copyright act or direct negotiation by the
libraries with the copyright holders. archives for radio and tv productions
should be set up and the law on legal deposits expanded to include non-book
material. cooperation within the nordic council is urged, and experiments in
selected libraries are recommended.

than films, it is important that libraries cooperate with other cultural
institutions in securing a quality production to counteract the present low
quality output. the medium also raises the possibility of libraries
establishing workshops where everyone can use equipment for video production.

it is impossible to draw a line between the training of pharmacists and other
natural science training. it is questionable what the purpose of training
actually is, but it is obvious that pharmacists must be trained to practise
immediately in a pharmacy, at a sick-bed, in a research institute or a
pharmaceutical factory. those involved in training need specialist books and
journals. in hungary, these can be purchased by everybody, although purchase
of foreign materials may be financially difficult. library budgets should
permit the purchase of expensive bibliographies and abstracting journals, and
reference books, librarians insisting on their continuous acquisition.
financial problems may be solved by budgets which follow proportional price
increase, and by governments willing to reduce import profit rates of
materials for education, research and medical treatment. librarians should be
well acquainted with the terminology, training system and literature of their
field, and be qualified to introduce readers to intellectual work.

1979 the standard of norwegian children's literature had greatly improved and
the number of available titles increased. in view of rising book prices,
priority was given to good norwegian children's books rather than adult and
foreign books in children's departments (excepting books for immigrants).
series books were excluded for a year as an experiment.

in the netherlands local authorities with less than 30,000 inhabitants may
organise their own library service. however, they are required by the dutch
public libraries act to work in close cooperation with the county library
network. library committees in these areas should include a representative
cross-section of the social and cultural life of the community. committee
members with local connections are more likely to understand the circumstances
of the area. however, where the local library committee insists on following
its own policies, the county library system may be prevented from pursuing a
coordinated policy for all libraries throughout its region. the interests of
the local community can be served by the creation of library users' committees
in each area.

of the optimal conditions for satisfying readers' requirements and overcoming
inconsistencies in the reading habits of different socio-economic groups'. the
principles involved in such planning include political commitment and a
scientific basis, and there is a tendency now to use a wide range of logical,

3 types of american library networks are defined' organisational, specialised
and functional. public libraries belong to the first group, whose planning and
development are the responsibility of state libraries. specialised networks
link together special libraries devoted to the same subject discipline
(nationwide networks of medical or agricultural libraries belong to this
group). the last type brings together libraries whose automated systems are
based on the use of the same data base (e.g. oclc). organisational structure
of the networks is discussed together with several other aspects including
users, centralised cataloguing and book processing, long term planning,
coordinated acquisitions, interlibrary lending and compilation of union
catalogues and bibliographies.

the importance of twinning arrangements between nordic towns for the

cooperation is not clear. the library is the natural point for collection of
material about the twin towns and for the transfer of material from the home
town to the twin towns. it should encourage reading of the neighbouring
countries' literature. describes the exchange agreements between jamtland
regional library in sweden, and south trondelag library association and the

(mls dissertation) in the mid-60s in the netherlands a meeting of about 50
librarians from public and research libraries attempted to find a solution to
the problems of university libraries and the provision of study literature to
non-university students. 2 answers were discussed' (1) a centralised
literature provision system, in which 1 scholarly library would be set up to
serve the non-university students; and (2) a decentralised system, ensuring
that study literature would be available through a network of regional central
libraries based in the provinces, as supporting libraries for the
universities. 12 such provincial libraries were proposed. reviews the problems

in the netherlands a change in government policy towards the provision of
regional library services is now becoming apparent. in the government's view
the increasing availability of on-line information retrieval services will
necessitate the creation of a network of well-stocked libraries in each
region. in order to finance such a policy whilst local authorities are
suffering severe economic restraints, the government has suggested that less
attention should be given to the recreational function of public libraries. in
addition, research by the bibliotheekraad (library advisory council) into
interlibrary lending in the netherlands has shown that there is insufficient
cooperation on acquisition policies amongst the libraries of each region. in
order to bring libraries together in closer cooperation it will be necessary
to overcome the resistance of individual librarians and to change the present
law relating to public libraries.

argues that the neglect of pr activities by public libraries has led to an
increasing lack of understanding of their basic aims among politicians and a
consequent reduction in their budgets. the library service occupies a modest
place in the public debate compared to other sectors because it has no
competitors and the public lacks a basis for comparison. library matters get
little publicity either in the national, local or professional press. actions
by user groups, especially if these are generally respected citizens, can be
very effective and contact with organisations such as the chamber of commerce
and the trade unions should be nurtured by the library. this could take the
form of 'friends of the library groups, as found largely in the usa, or, more
in line with danish practice, user councils.

ensure actual payment of grants to the individual states. for this to happen,
persistent lobbying of the congress committee is necessary. the office keeps

proposal for a new library law will be presented to parliament in the
beginning of the session 1981-82, and it is hoped to get broad party support
for it. the proposal suggests, not a joint directorate, but library management
with an administrative leader responsible for tasks common to public and
research libraries and interlending services. would prefer school libraries to
belong under the education ministry, but they should cater for leisure reading
as well as providing educational resource material. librarians should be left
to fulfil the obligation of comprehensiveness in book selection, and local
politicians should not exercise any form of censorship prior to selection.
stands firm on the principle of no charge for any library services. librar ies

the latest interim report from the norwegian juel committee on local
government reform, 2new finance system for county authorities1, could
seriously affect public libraries. if its proposals are implemented, financial
arrangements between state, county and municipal authorities will be
abolished, and state subsidies given only where absolutely essential. state
support of libraries and cultural activities is considered neither desirable
nor necessary. the state library office, in reply, considers the present state
grants vital in operating a satisfactory library service according to the
library act. local authorities are not legally obliged to administer county
libraries; without state support, libraries might receive only minimal sums,
leading at worst to the closure of county library services in some counties.
since public and mobile libraries are nowadays closely linked to county
libraries, this would seriously damage the provision of  an adequate national
library service.

.I 2697

state grants to the vest-agder (norway) county library amounted in 1980 to 35%
of its budget. recent proposals by the juel committee on local government
reform would mean the withdrawal of state support. if responsibility for
library service devolves entirely on local authorities, the norwegian public
library system will be threatened by disintegration, with national library
duties concentrated in a few state-owned special libraries. since even the
revised library act of 1971 did not oblige counties to operate a library
service, the system has been established and developed largely through the
influence and support of central authority. the basis for the 1971 act was the
long-standing regional imbalance in school library and public library
standards. under the new proposals, libraries in the most deprived areas would
be in most danger, and cultural activity as a whole would be vulnerable to
political motivation.

.I 2707

the debate on computers in libraries centres around 2 questions' whether
computers on the whole are of benefit to users, and whether the bums system in
particular is of value. introduction of computers means that library staff
become dependent on experts. as processes become automated they also become
dehumanised, and readers use machines directly with minimal help from staff.
some skills are lost and replaced with routines. as for the bums system, some
routines have merely replaced others. a traditional card catalogue is easier
to use than the bums catalogue, although the latter makes survey of the
library's total stock possible. but this leads in turn to increase in the
number of requests within the library system; it favours the active,
experienced users, but discourages the inexperienced and the browsers. the
cost of gathering of statistics through through bums and training of staff in
data technology must be set against other possible uses of the resources.

sums up the impressions of automation in us libraries. most larger library
systems have now automated their technical processes, but automation of the
more complicated bibliographic routines, such as literature searching which
necessitate uniform and well developed cataloguing, is not widespread. the
process of automation started in the 60s spurred largely by the general us
openness towards technological developments and pressure from commercial
firms. the lack of interlibrary cooperation and of standardisation of work
routines in us public libraries has encouraged the adoption of automation
systems tailor-made to individual libraries. the general impact of automation
has not been much studied, but there was agreement that computer technology
had led to centralisation, less independence for branches, better
interlending, and had freed resources for other services. although fewer staff
tended to be employed, none had been directly made redundant. no cost-benefit
analyses seemed to have been carried out. the reactions of users, both staff
and readers, were largely favourable, except perhaps in branch public
libraries.

low cost computing hardware with increasingly sophisticated software is
providing opportunities for the development of new, or the revision of
existing, information systems. the procedures which are involved in the
planning stage of such systems have been influenced by the costs involved and
the decision making is more in the hands of the department or unit within an
organisation than it was. a staged procedure with a checklist of activities,
appropriate documentation and considerations to be taken at each stage is 1
way to reduce the chances of error in the decisions made in the planning
process.

modern society is dominated by science and technology. however, insufficient
attention has been paid to the social implications of automation. the
professional organisations of librarianship in the netherlands have undertaken
no studies of the social implications on their members' behalf apart from the
netherlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and
literature), which in 1979 formed a committee to investigate ways of
protecting the privacy of the individual against the misuse of personal
information in computerised systems. however, the recommendations of the
committee were rejected in 1980 by nblc members as too radical. automation
will lead to a reduction in the number of posts in libraries at all levels and
librarians must act now to prevent a further deterioration in the situation.

the introduction of ibm's stairs program for information storage and retrieval
on a large mainframe computer, similar programs soon became available for use
on the range of minicomputers which had started to penetrate the market. many
were specially commissioned for library and information use; discusses cairs

the 1st and foremost task of librarians in bulgaria is to educate their
readers and to exercise influence on their reading habits. to be capable of
performing the job successfully, librarians must acquire a working knowledge
of sociology, psychology and pedagogy. thus, they will not only see each
reader as an individual with his/her own family and educational background,
personal qualities, and professional requirements, but they will also be able
to make the best of a leader's authority in a group. education of children and
adolescents has benefitted from collaboration between teachers and librarians
and the experience gained must now be used more fully in adult education. on

criteria for the personality of a good librarian, library management and the

opened in 1977, this library, a central library in a system with 12 branch
libraries, is a finely designed modern building stocking over 2 million
volumes. the ground floor contains the general reference department, including
quick reference and bibliographic services, and special services including
chair lifts and reading equipment for the handicapped, music studios
containing pianos and media for listening to music, study carrels for language
courses and microfilm readers, rooms for meetings and a cafeteria. the 12
subject departments are arranged in 4 galleries above the ground floor. their
stocks include reference and lending material; reference and advisory servies
of an outstandingly high quality are provided. there is a special collection
of english language periodicals dating from the 18th century.

report on karup library, with an interview with the librarian, birte
ellermann. the library is housed in a converted railway station. the lack of
space and the retention of the old inner walls contribute to the intimate and
friendly atmosphere. 75% of the population use it, compared to 30% before
conversion. the young people's room on the 1st floor is a popular meeting
place for the 13-16 year olds. b. ellermann, then librarian at the nearby
karup airforce base, was asked to draw up a plan for the library structure in
the area. her decentralised plan of 3 independent libraries gave her a danish
library association prize. local craftsmen have executed her own interior
design. exhibitions are made locally, and books are received from a local
bookseller and made ready in the library so that they reach the shelves while

the council for scientific information published its report on space
requirements for university libraries in may 81. the report deals with 22
university libraries. in the 70s the total annual growth of shelf metres was
about 3%. the council forecasts a growth of about 4% for the 80s. it does not
think that the developments in microforms and computerised services will
change the situation in the next 15 to 20 years. some of the council's
recommendations are' shelf measurement for collections should be the
following' open shelves 6.3 metres per sq metre; closed access 8 shelf metres
per sq metre; storage 9.3 metres per sq metre; and stacks 19 metres per sq
metre. a national cooperative storage library should be established. libraries
should have more enclosed reading rooms and research rooms.

increasing reports of noise in the library of the state university of new york
college at cortland prompted interest in reducing noise levels. chairs, tables
and carrels were adjacent and frequently arranged in clusters; previous
research indicated that such an arrangement may increase talking and thus
noise levels. it was hypothesised that disassembling the clusters and
separating the 3 types of furniture would reduce noise. a multiple baseline
design was used with 2 measures of noise' an electromechanical (objective)
system and subjective ratings of perceived noise. results showed no difference
due to the objective measure but significant reductions in subjective ratings,

an important task of the 5-year-plan is to save readers' expenditure of effort
in using libraries. computerised catalogues show wide potential. readers'
requests are transmitted to large libraries' bookstores along t.v.
communication channels. document reproduction has significantly lessened
readers' expenditure of effort. automation of acquisitioning, cataloguing,
interlibrary loans, selective retrieval also save readers' time. large
libraries have automated systems for issuing bibliographies, abstracts, union
catalogues. large information-computer centres will be created for collective
use as information transmission systems. the state automated scientific and
technical information system should economise on librarians' and readers'
time' the governing factors in library automation.

photography has taken on an increasingly important role in public library
work. most often thought of in terms of outreach work and publicity, its
effect has been even more dramatic in the impact of microforms. among reader
services the availability of photocopiers is already taken for granted and in
the near future improved models capable of reproducing tone illustrations or
instant copiers using polaroid film will be equally common. suggests some
ideas and some methods for creative application of photography in library
work, together with sufficient technical information to enable the
non-photographer to put them into effect.

2 studies conducted over a period of 10 years revealed a number of
consistencies in the use of information in planning, both as far as the demand
for information is concerned and the problems involved in utilisation of
existing sources on the supply side. developments that have occurred over that
period reflect the considerable number of improvements of both advisory and
statutory nature. these result in a more comprehensive systems-wide approach
and an increased awareness of the role of improved information bases. further
improvements are still desirable, however, notably in the form of improved
linkages and continued dissemination of experience whether positive or
negative.

libraries collect, store and disseminate relevant knowledge and information to
national populations. the term 'relevant information' is discussed in relation
to the kenyan population. approximately 95% of the kenyan population is made
up of workers and peasants and a relevant library service should be aware of
the problems that these people have to face. the content of the information
communicated, the way in which it is communicated and the language in which it
is communicated are important aspects which need to be considered by the
library service if it is to supply information to those people who need it
most. the people's republic of china is cited as a country where some success
has been made in overcoming these problems. much valuable information has
accumulated over the years among the population and could be usefully applied
if it was successfully provided to those who need it.

card and abstracting services, and the 2chemical abstracts1 search system.
retrospective searching is carried out manually through, for example,
2chemical abstracts1. it is proposed to cooperate directly with the computer

was the specialist department or institution, and in apr 79 1,200 reference
sources were registered, representing 550 norwegian institutions. indexing of
sources is based on annual reports, checked by the institutions. institutions
can be approached individually if the problem requires precise definition, or
the index used alone via a computer terminal. data on personal reference
sources must be constantly updated. similar systems exist in other countries,
and the idea could be extended' all users of computer terminals (8,000 in
norway in 1978, estimated to reach 2 0,000 in 1985) are potential clients.
possible dangers of monopoly, abuse, or takeover by a foreign power should be
technically avoidable.

the geoecology data base represents a unique compilation of computerised
environmental data for research and development needs. in the environmental
sciences division (esd) at oak ridge national laboratory (ornl), has been
developed an integrated data base of environmental resource information from
extant sources. data are stored at the county level of resolution for the
united states with some data available for subcounty units within larger, more
diverse eastern counties. the geoecology data base contains selected data on
terrain and soils, water resources, forestry, vegetation, agriculture, land
use, wildlife, air quality, climate, natural areas, and endangered species.
basic files on human population are also included to complement the

without knowledge on literature usage, university-acquired knowledge will
gradually vanish. since thesis presentation at a faculty of pharmacology is
only necessary for a phd, tasks must be assigned which require a certain

there have always been problems connected with journal collections in
libraries. collections were often incomplete, unsuitably stored and often
impossible to locate owing to incomplete cataloguing. 1 improvement was the
introduction of microfilm which was easier to store and meant that original
journal copies could be stored in the archives and not damaged by continual
use. the association of german librarians' commission for journals has
published important material dealing with the best ways of storing and
cataloguing journal collections and cooperative filming with other libraries.
an important aid to locating journals is gerd hagelweide's location catalogue
deutsche zeitungsbestande in bibliotheken und archiven (german journal
collections in libraries and archives). the publication of regional journal
catalogues in westphalia, berlin, hesse and wurtemberg has helped to improve
lending systems in these areas.

providing complete analytics for microform collections is more the ideal
rather than the reality for most libraries. even with partially analysed
collections, however, libraries can improve access and publicise the extent of

labelling microform bibliographies, placing plastic overlays on catalogue
cards, annotating short title catalogues, and compiling guidebooks to major
microform collections.

workers and many members of all the other classes of organisation studied need
to maintain an up-to-date knowledge of research work in progress and this is
true of all disciplines. a majority of the needs expressed would be met by the

books and information literature published by the central institute of
librarianship as a basis to improve their information activity. this list
includes all general reference literature such as encyclopaedias,
dictionaries, statutes, and the works of marx, engels and lenin. it is also
important to keep the collection of information material up to date with
current parliamentary reports, conference reports, and territorial literature
such as town guides and other maps. trade union literature should also be
available in public libraries. librarians should improve information activi
ties to meet the raised level of user demand in this field.

following a request by hordaland county library, delegates from the norwegian
state film centre, the national association of municipal cinematographers, and
the state library office discussed film-shows as part of library service.
libraries, like local authorities and cultural committees, can obtain
permission for film-shows, certain short or informational films being exempt.
cooperation between library and authority may include exchange of information,
joint shows for preschool children, use of film in further education, and
showing of films and videotapes in libraries. good children's films are ideal
for library showing and can be linked with books. not all library premises are
suitable for film-shows; this factor should be considered in planning new
libraries. loan of films should be administered by county libraries. all
libraries should have film catalogues, possibly distributed by the state
library office. the association of cinematographers hope to purchase several
sets of apparatus for use in selected areas.

a strong plea for establishing a new, centralised enterprise to supply
libraries, especially public libraries, with literature and up-to-date
equipment. enterprise of that kind had been envisaged already in the statute
for the national network of libraries in bulgaria. similar organisations have
been in operation in other socialist countries. they are of invaluable
assistance to librarians, in particular those in small libraries, who very
often lack the necessary qualifications in librarianship and work only
part-time. books are selected, purchased and distributed to libraries almost
immediately after they have been published, the catalogue cards with
appropriate annotations being delivered at the same time. thus, new
acquisitions are selected expertly to maintain the proper ratio between
political, fictional and special material. librarians are by these means
relieved of the tedious and time-consuming task of cataloguing, and can devote
more time to their readers, to their ideological education and to professional
advancement.

revised version of part of a paper presented to the international seminar on
national document provision, boston spa, 22-24 sept 80. 4 types of national
interlending systems have been identified. models a, b, and c represent
planned centralisation or decentralisation. model d is unplanned
decentralisation. it occurs frequently and, if the time and money necessary
for better models are lacking, an upgraded version can be used. the cost of
the necessary union catalogues can be decreased by automation. speed of supply
by and goodwill of net lenders can be improved by cost recovery. alternative
methods of payment should be considered, including a system based on an
international guarantee fund.

edited version of paper presented at the international seminar on national
document provision, boston spa, 22-24 sept 80. supraregional document supply
is decentralised in west germany because the political framework is federal.
coordination of acquisitions is achieved by the deutsche
forschungsgemeinschaft, which organises and largely funds a cooperative
programme based on special subject libraries
(sondersammelgebietsbibliotheken). the 7 regional union catalogues have been
supplemented by central subject catalogues, the berlin periodicals data base,
and other union cataloguing projects. interlending is based on the 7 regions,
but direct requesting to the special subject libraries has increased
significantly in the search for faster supply times.

examines the problems associated with large-scale relegation of books from
academic libraries. indicators of use and non-use are developed for general
application. it is shown that the relegation of periodicals is considerably
less expensive both in terms of investment of effort and space released than
the relegation of monographs. the relevance to a local library situation of
british library lending division data on periodical usage is vindicated.

during recent years there has been a growing concern over the physical
condition of library collections. paper is brittle and crumbling, bindings are
disintegrating, print is fading and covers are soft and spongy. unfortunately
restoration is expensive and time consuming. discusses the destructive forces
in the library and the many available solutions to prevent and control the
problems. claims that conservation programmes are sometimes treated with
apathy and resistance due to the philosophy of placing priorities on services.
concludes that restoration work is best left to professional conservators
while preventative measures can be instituted by dedicated librarians.

paper presented by the french honorary inspector general of libraries at a
librarians' study day, feb 80, marking heritage year in france. considers the
nature of france's library heritage, and gives examples of the notable
buildings and interiors which must be included with france's outstanding
library collections of books, documents, maps, coins, and other objects of
value. discussion of collections covers 4 main topics' conservation,
exploitation, enrichment, and transmission. the librarian's responsibilities
in relation to each are considered, with particular reference to the problems
of conservation. current procedures are surveyed and a comprehensive policy
suggested, focusing on bibliotheque nationale activities and recent research
on new techniques. details are given of existing catalogues and projects for
facilitating exploitation. in conclusion the immense value of france's library
heritage is emphasised.

.I 2858
.W
among the many expressions of the past brought to light during heritage year
in france (1980), the book, in manuscript and print forms, in public or
private collections, ought to be protected by a national conservation policy.
although a number of partial inventories exist, such a policy cannot be
maintained at present in france without the existence of a general inventory.
apart from the national library, which has specialised restoration facilities
and a department for the prevention and detection of damaged documents,
libraries rarely have the means to assure the material protection of
documents. the protection of the national heritage should extend to the
selection of 20th century documents.

(phd thesis-university of wisconsin-madison.) during the 19th century, the
indian government sought to preserve indian culture. 1 action was an order in
1858 which had 3 provisions' (1) to print lists of sanskrit manuscripts held
by indian libraries and make the lists available worldwide; (2) to institute
searches for manuscripts; and (3) to assist the asiatic society of bengal in
its sanskrit publication programme. investigates the order's background, the
resultant emergence of research libraries specialising in sanskrit, and the
attitudes of successive indian governments up to 1938.

a critical review by vejle library's automation committee of the national
association of local authorities' report on 2automated issue control, 1one of
the proposals for standard specifications issued by the biblioteksdata
partners. the review points to problems of use of the register of personal
code numbers. the system whereby check-out uses personal numbers, while the
return process uses book numbers, causes problems for the reader of
identifying which books are due back when. discusses how the system deals with
renewals, fines, and recalls. use of book numbers only for reservations
amounts to a deterioration of service, and the method whereby interlibrary
loans are included is unclear. issue control over material which cannot be
given a book number (e.g. picture books, jigsaws) is effectively abandoned. in
all, the lack of information about each loan causes major problems; it should
be possible to use the information in the bibliographic base also in the
issue control registers.

under arl sponsorship, king research, inc., developed a library catalog cost
model to assist 72 participating libraries in comparing the cost of
alternative future forms of catalogue, emphasising the cost of implementing
aacr2. 68 libraries prepared inputs characterising their costs and modes of
operation, and these were used, with the model, to compute costs of
alternative catalogue forms. inputs and outputs of the model were highly
variable. costs of implementing aacr2 were estimated to be 4-7% of the total
cost of developing and maintaining a catalogue. the model can be a useful
planning, budgeting and staffing tool, and may be seen as a prototype,
adaptable to project costs of other library operations, especially
acquisitions. recommendations are made for future model development.

operations, especially in the technical service departments of us colleges and
universities. concludes that the emergence of automation and modern technology
in the library has brought a kind of career awareness to the front in the
library community. argues that academic librarians should take advantage now
of the technology which has given them some free time from manual work that
can be devoted to the setting forth of their professional goals and objectives
for the future.

discusses the reasons behind the suspension of the projected network in
lombardy, begun in 1975 and disrupted in 1977. details are given of the
structure of the system drawn up by the regional administration, the
organisation and operation of existing libraries as information and
cataloguing centres, and the technical equipment introduced. with the change
of government in 1977, the project was suspended for re-evaluation, and up to
1980 no decision had been reached. the inherent defects of the system are
analysed, to show how the regional administration made a fundamental error in
establishing a decentralised system without overhauling existing services to
ensure adequate cooperation between cataloguing centres. the immediate causes
of suspension were incompatability of the automated system chosen with marc,
and failure of individual libraries to maintain routine cataloguing
activities. emph asises the necessity for basic reorganisation of national
library services prior to schemes for automation and cooperation.

for part i 2see1 81/5842. describes the experiment's phase 0, which relates to
a pilot project based on limited data and an unaltered search system' the
library school's subject retrieval system (bes). the phase has the following
components' 1. transfer of catalogue entries from kommunedata to recku (the
regional computer centre of copenhagen university). 2. change of format from
the bc format (danmarc) to the bes format; lists the bes search codes used,
with an example. 3. building up of search registers, with list of taboo words.
4. demonstration runs. concludes that phase 0 has shown that data compiled for
use in printed catalogues can be used in an on-line system. some problems in
connection with input of foreign language items remain. the system enables
search via dk5, author and title like manual catalogues, but also terms in the
title  and note fields and other combinations. although subject searches were
not included, the bes program makes input of subject search words possible.

the issue of oclc benefits for special libraries is discussed in terms of
'find rates'. a stratified random sample revealed that 21% of a special
collection's holdings were in the oclc data base and were scattered among 95
libraries. this low find rate is useful for documenting the uniqueness of the
special collection and the lack of existing bibliographical control for such
material. the study suggests that special libraries consider oclc
participation when find rates are low based on considerations other than cost
savings for technical services.

in feb 79 the norwegian dewey committee sent a questionnaire to 179 public and
special libraries, enquiring about their use of dewey and/or arnesen
(norwegian version of dewey); editions used; size of collections;
subject-headings lists used; indexes required; subject areas where dewey did
not meet norwegian requirements; and additional aids desirable. the aim was to
chart norwegian use of dewey and obtain help towards a new edition of arnesen
and in the committee's future work. of 117 libraries which replied, 77 used
dewey and/or arnesen, many supplementing arnesen from other sources. several
libraries specified problem fields, arnesen being found weakest in classes
300, 700 and 900. proposals included microcard indexes; current subject card
catalogues; classification on publication; and periodical publication with
continuing updating. the survey revealed a clear need for a new, extended
edition of arnesen, and a likely increase in interest in dewey, the  state
library council having recommended dewey and udc as national classification
policy.

dewey's introduction has been dropped from the current 19th edition of the
classification scheme. perhaps because of its allegedly phonetic spelling it
has been neglected. however, since it is considered that this introduction
says everything which can be said about library classification it is
considered that it should not now be forgotten. however the failure to relate
the theory in the introduction to the actual arrangement of the subjects
within the schedules set the unfortunate pattern by which library
classification came to be discussed with little or no reference to the subject
matter involved. the fact that dewey survives as the most widely used
classification reflects the physical difficulty of trying to reclassify any
established library and the lack of any new thinking in educational curricula.
there is no evidence that later schemes represent any worthwhile advance on
dewey.

terms into files of similar concepts and facilitates the generation of
products useful in vocabulary review and in term structuring. syndetic
relations, indicated by assigning coded identification numbers, are altered

reports on an international conference on on-line information in public
libraries organised by the british library research and development department
and held in sept. 81. a number of british public libraries have during the
last 3 years carried out experiments with the use of on-line systems. results
of these have been published in the british library's report series and were
discussed at the conference. the question of payment for on-line searches was
debated. the experience in other countries was outlined, including the one
from gentofte, denmark. in luton central library, england, which formerly
subscribed to only a few conventional bibliographic services, installation of
on-line facilities has led to a large expansion. new users have been
attracted, the library's image improved, and the ensuing good-will has been a
useful tool in the fight against cuts. the staff have become more cost
conscious and hence more careful in dealing with users, who have been more
thoroughly interviewed. more time is now spent preparing the search strategy.
the danger of redundancies as a result of greater efficiency was therefore
dismissed.

reviews prevailing methodologies of fact retrieval in science and technology
and makes projections for the decade to come' numeric data bases are shown to
overtake in size and number the large bibliographic collections. this is
expected to lead toward more sophisticated, interactive data analysis
techniques with graphical display options. the availability of low-cost
intelligent computer terminals, micro- and minicomputers, is shown to make
aggregation and post-processing of retrieved information from different
sources readily possible. this capability may come into conflict with legal
constraints and is bound to affect the traditional marketing of information.
it will lead to the extraction of higher forms of intelligence from text and
data. the user community is seen to shift from expert information specialists,
who act now as middlemen, to the end-users of information. this less
experienced user community will challenge the ingenuity of system designers
for self-guiding, adaptive, and yet more sophisticated man-machine interfaces.
the merging of wide-band digital communication networks with computer
technologies will make it possible to interconnect computers, information
centres, word processors, and other peripherals, worldwide.

the facilities of prestel, the uk post office viewdata service, are outlined,
emphasising the aspects of its design which make it very easy to use. the very
simple structure of the data is also discussed and compared with other
viewdata systems. normal prestel terminals have limited capabilities but
intelligent terminals are being developed which will allow telesoftware to be

comments on the report by the teletext committee, set up in 1978 by the prime
minister's office to examine whether there was any justification for
introducing 1 or more teletext systems in denmark and to evaluate the costs
involved. the report recommends the introduction of text-tv, which is regarded
as a useful and cheap means of texting tv programmes and distributing general
information. teledata's direct connection to data bases with unlimited
information makes it especially useful for information searches. it can also
be used by libraries for location of books, loan information, and readers'
advice. other uses include' updating of reference works and all social
information of a changing nature' timetables, address lists, etc. however,
teledata is very costly and demands a high degree of adaptability by users.
its introduction as a permanent public service should therefore await the
results of the planned experiment expected in 1983 and sho uld also be
discussed by the media commission.

factfinder is a minicomputer-based information handling package developed on
the basis of total information management. within the system the concepts of
text processing and word processing are united to provide effective management
of information at every stage. thus, factfinder combines flexible data input
facilities with a powerful retrieval capability, enhanced by the inclusion of
efficient editing and reporting functions. factfinder is specifically designed
for interactive use in a multi-user environment. input is user-defined and may
be free text or formatted. editing and retrieval are also on-line procedures
and due to factfinder's efficient background processing facility, the updating
and printing functions may run simultaneously with these on-line terminal
activities. any batch routines are also initiated at the terminals although
these are few and of a utility or security nature. factfinder is based on the
swedish imdoc system and is m arketed by mcs mini-computer systems ltd. the
software is written in extensive basic and the system is available as a
complete package of software and hardware based on the data general range of
minicomputers. both software and hardware are fully supported by mini-computer
systems ltd.

.I 2933
.W
a flexible low cost minicomputer based information retrieval system is
described. cairs (computer assisted information retrieval system) allows
information in the form of documents, text, records or abstracts to be stored
in a computer data base. the programs have been written in rtl2, a high level
transportable computer language, which allows cairs to run on most popular
minicomputers. data entry is carried out using a direct key to disc facility,
with formatted visual display screens being presented to speed input. the
advantages of input validation and efficient editing of entered material are
fully exploited, and an interactive thesaurus may also be used. data on cairs
can be indexed using classification systems or hierarchical structures.
alternatively, keyword indexing of the automatic, semi-automatic or manual
type may be applied, plus either a free or controlled language vocabulary.
searching proceeds via inverted file and ser ial (string) search functions,
although a variety of specialised tasks allow bulletins, lists and catalogues
to be produced. cairs is designed to replace any applications where manual
card index filing systems are employed, and is available as both a software
system or as a complete software/hardware package.

a commercially available on-line search service was used as a standard for
comparative searching and evaluation of an in-house information system based
on automatic indexing. system features were identified and evaluated on the
basis of their usefulness in various kinds of searching, their ease in
implementation, and how they are influenced by differences in user type or
specific applications. some common features of the commercial system, such as
on-line instruction, user-specified print formats, dictionary display, and
truncation, are seen to be unnecessary or impractical for the in-house system.

examines some publications concerned with the role of public libraries in
computer searching. describes a 3 year project (dialib) in california seeking
to investigate the role of the public library as a linking agent to commercial
data bases using the lockheed dialog information retrieval service. the
service was free for the 1st year only. users were university students and
researchers, professional people and librarians. provides a checklist of
points to be observed in the planning phase. concludes that on-line services
are a natural development in public libraries supplementing traditional
reference services. describes another project involving 4 public libraries in
england. the planned on-line service in lancashire (biros) was to be a service
separate from the manual reference work. here too, staff was specially trained
and the public, mainly from educational institutions, seemed willing to pay
the necessary fees. a set of ' guidelines' was prepared. finally, discusses
atherton and christian's' 'librarians and online services', which examines how
and why libraries make automated search systems available and stresses that
these systems change the role of the reference librarian qualitatively from
that of an archivist to that of an information specialist.

an experiment is described that evaluated the usefulness and economic
feasibility of incorporating data tags into secondary information files. tags
are brief codes that indicate the presence in a primary document of specific
types of numerical data. tags were selected in cooperation with users of the
u.s. department of energy's (doe) recon system and added to a special version
of the computer-readable energy file. recon users assisted in an evaluation of
the tagging process. it was found that data tags do increase access to
numerical data in the primary literature, but a file spanning several years is
necessary to produce useful results. evaluation of processing costs revealed
that after the initial training period, costs were not significantly greater
for the number and types of data tags employed in this study. the feasibility
of including data tags in nonenergy sections of 2chemical abstracts 1was
examin ed with primary emphasis on economic and editorial factors. it was
shown that subject content governs the selection of data types to be tagged
for a section or group of related sections with the overriding consideration
of user requirements.

passage retrieval (already operational for lawyers) has advantages in output
form over reference retrieval and is economically feasible. previous
experiments in passage retrieval for scientists have demonstrated recall and
false retrieval rates as good or better than those of present reference
retrieval services. the present experiment involved a greater variety of forms
of retrieval question. in addition, search words were selected independently
by 2 different people for each retrieval question. the search words selected,
in combination with the computer procedures used for passage retrieval,
produced average recall ratios of 72 and 67%, respectively, for the 2
selectors. the false retrieval rates were (except for 1 predictably difficult
question) respectively 13 and 10 falsely retrieved sentences per answer-paper

when developing on-line retrieval systems, the speed of response to inquiries
is one of the main characteristics of the system's quality. considers a
component of response time-the descriptor retrieval time. discusses direct,
inverse, and combined patterns of file organisation, makes a comparative
analysis, and evaluates descriptor retrieval time for each. proposes a
probability model of retrieval in a combined file. on the basis of this model,
the problem of optimising a combined file according to the time criterion is

concerns the problem of how to permit a patron to represent the relative
importance of various index terms in a boolean request while retaining the
desirable properties of a boolean system. classical boolean systems are
reviewed and related to the notion of fuzzy sets. the fuzzy set concept then
forms the basis of the concept of a fuzzy request in which weights are
assigned to index terms. the properties of such a system are discussed, and it
is shown that such systems retain the manipulability of traditional boolean
requests.

the way that individuals construct and modify search queries on a large
interactive document retrieval system is subject to systematic biases similar
to those that have been demonstrated in experiments on judgments under
uncertainty. these biases are shared by both naive and sophisticated subjects
and cause the inquirer to construct and modify queries inefficiently. a
searching algorithm is suggested that helps the inquirer to avoid the effect
of these biases.

some of the automatic classification procedures used in information retrieval
derive clusters of documents from an intermediate similarity matrix, the
computation of which involves comparing each of the documents in the
collection with all of the others. it has recently been suggested that many of
these comparisons, specifically those between documents having no terms in
common, may be avoided by means of the use of an inverted file to the document
collection. it is shown that the approach will effect reductions in the number
of interdocument comparisons only if the documents are each indexed by a
limited number of indexing terms; if exhaustive indexing is used, many
document pairs will be compared several times over and the computation will be
greater than when conventional approaches are used to generate the similarity
matrix.

in recent years, the market in microcomputers has mushroomed making such
systems available at prices from under *6100-*610,000's, rivalling the
facilities and power of minicomputers or even small mainframes. gives a brief
history of the development of microcomputers and describes the various
components of such a system. pays particular attention to the type of
component that is likely to be available in systems which can be classified as
'small business systems' and investigates the applications of such systems.
despite the vast market in microcomputers, there are still many restrictions
which may prevent their being used in some applications, such as the capacity
of the primary memory. furthermore, there are very few standards in the area
of microcomputers, leading to problems of compatibility both from the hardware
and software viewpoint. such problems are being overcome at present but it is
likely that they will persist for some time to  come as the pressures of
marketing cannot wait for standards to be developed. the restrictions of
microcomputers are also being overcome, particularly with the development of
16-bit (and even 32-bit) processors and more sophisticated methods of storage,
such as 'bubble memories'. examines such developments and briefly contrasts

examines some of the conditions necessary for successful educational activity
of the sort which would lay the foundation for meaningful library development
in peru. highland structures of social and productive relations have long
obstructed official efforts, but the rijchary movement, active in the
department of puno in the 30s and 40s, suggests by contrast some of the
elements that have both stirred and responded to indigenous aspirations.
'rijchary' means 'awaken!' and the movement, led by nunez butron,
doctor-in-residence for puno's azangaro province, included campaigns for basic
public hygiene, patriotism and literacy.

report on a conference, held by educationalists, sociologists and librarians
in bremen, nov 80, on illiteracy among children and adults. recent campaigns
against illiteracy abroad show results far in advance of those hitherto
achieved in west germany. researchers must find out who the illiterate are and
the best ways to reach them; some work is already being done by staff at adult
education centres, penal institutions and the local press. problems of staff
and money shortages must be overcome and beginners' reading books produced
suitable for adults. librarians can help by working with schools and
kindergartens to alleviate the fear of entering a library felt by many people;
they can provide suitable media to help school teachers, adult education
centres and the readers themselves and assist in media production by
cooperating with authors and publishers.

reviews progress made in the compilation of bibliographies in hungary since
the national working conference on bibliography in 1961 had identified large
gaps in coverage and the need for coordination. the national szechenyi library
has made considerable efforts to develop an up-to-date system for the
hungarian national bibliography; the greatest bibliography of the period
1921-44. progress in special bibliographies has been haphazard with overlap in
some fields while certain other fields such as mathematics and physics have no
current bibliographies. it is to be feared that without a coordinating body to
plan bibliographic activities, it will take a long time to have a complete
system of bibliographies in hungary.

libraries and publishers have evolved together. publishers rely on libraries
as a minimum market for their scholarly products. inflationary pressures have
caused publishers to increase prices that, in turn, strain library budgets
that have not increased as fast, and which, in turn, undermine the minimal
demand publishers can count on, adding to inflationary pressure. a simple
mathematical model for the dynamics of the interaction between libraries and
publishers is analysed.

based on discussions conducted with officials from the commission of the
european communities during a study visit to brussels, nov 79. uk membership
of the european communities has added a new dimension to the national
legislative process and has generated a fresh body of legislative and
associated documentation. it has also provided librarians with a new series of
challenges. the study visit was conceived as a fact-finding exercise to gather
basic information about the internal structure of the community's publishing
programme and documentation system. consequently, the report contains separate
chapters on community publications policy, on the nature and characteristics
of commission documents (as distinct from publications) and on the range of
automated information-retrieval services offered to members of staff within

text of the address given to the society of indexers, 28 may 1981. considers
some of the problems with which indexers are currently concerned. topics
discussed include: the 2 types of indexes to be found in contemporary
publications; some valuable indexing manuals which should be made available to
indexers; scope for improvement which exists in indexing practice-in
particular the elimination of 'see' and 'see also' references; the size of
type used in indexes; the indexing of fiction; and the compilation of thesauri
for the use of indexers.

the retrieval performance of book indexes can be measured in terms of their
ability to direct a user selectively to text material whose identity but not
location is known. the method requires human searchers to base their searching
strategies on actual passages from the book rather than on test queries,
natural or contrived. it circumvents the need for relevance judgment, but
still yields performance indicators that correspond approximately to the
recall and precision ratios of large document retrieval system evaluation.

another. concludes, however, that it is an aid rather than a competitor to

major points of librarian opposition to plr, focusing on the questions' do
authors have natural proprietary rights concerning their texts; are libraries
infringing these rights; do authors suffer financial damage through library
circulation; what are the effects of plr on libraries; and who will really
benefit from plr. librarians do recognise the financial plight of most authors
and have suggested alternatives to plr in the areas of' curtailment of library
purchases; special pricing of library books; direct tax relief; augmentation
of royalty income; and augmented programmes of literary awards.

contribution to a thematic issue on public lending right (plr). most plr
proponents content that plr legislation is an integral part of copyright law,
but in only 1 of the 10 countries to enact plr legislation has the statute
been made a part of copyright law. the plr concept does not fit neatly into
the principles of us copyright law, but the successful development of 2droit
de suite1 legislation (requiring payment of royalties to artists for resale of
their works) in california is an indication that plr is a workable concept in
the us legal structure.

netherlands, and west germany. attempts to establish a joint plr scheme in
scandinavia, or at least reciprocal bilateral agreements, have been
unsuccessful. denmark, the netherlands, and west germany are facing the
problem of maintaining different schemes within the european economic
community (eec). of these 3, only west germany has a plr scheme which is
within its copyright laws and which does not operate for the benefit of its
own citizens. the eec prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality; the
effect of this on plr is being debated.

contribution to a thematic issue on public lending right (plr). in south
africa, authors are not remunerated for use of their works in libraries and,
in comparison with most western countries, very little is being done by the
state to support authors financially and stimulate local book production and
literature. relatively few publications on plr have appeared and the authors'
campaign for a plr system has not yet gained momentum.

contribution to a thematic issue on public lending right (plr). discussion on
plr is much further advanced in canada than in the usa-authors' and
librarians' groups have issued resolutions and manifestoes; formal debates
have been held; and the canada council (a governmental corporation which
administers grant programmes for artists and authors) is developing a model
for compensating authors, based on holdings of their works by libraries. given
the present political climate in the usa, plr issues are not as tightly drawn
there. most us librarians are only dimly aware of plr, but militancy among
professional authors is growing.

contribution to a thematic issue on public lending right (plr). plr faces
obstacles that may well keep it from us shores for a long time. a sampling of

attraction to plr that may blossom into the kind of support the concept has
found elsewhere. this may give plr a ring of inevitability.

no cooperation and the schemes are dissimilar. outlines the qualification
rules for authors and works in each scheme. unlike australia, new zealand does
not make payments to publishers and the scheme's introduction involved close
cooperation between authors and librarians. in australia, payments are the
same as in 1973 despite an increase in the consumer price index of nearly 100%

manufacturing and user's application. the expression of resolution power by
lines per min is sometimes confusing, so the method readable by the pattern
from the nbs resolution test chart 1010a regardless of the reduction ratio has
been introduced. furthermore, using the quality index chart, it is possible to
understand the difference between the resolution power required to microfilm
the originals containing only romanic letters and those containing chinese
characters, which are much more complicated in structure.

interviews ingar beckman-hirschfeldt, chairman of the swedish public
librarians' union (sff) in connection with a campaign organised by dik
(documentation, information, culture), an umbrella organization of 8
associations, of which sff is a member. the campaign aims to put pressure on
politicians up to the time of local and general elections in 1982 and
demonstrate the consequences of cuts; a discussion book describing the present
state of cultural institutions and stating alternatives which would give
higher priority to culture is to be published. public opinion is to be
mobilised and a cultural programme for dik drawn up. although no section of
the campaign is aimed specifically at libraries, demand for a library law to
ensure reasonable and uniform standards will be made. cuts in cultural
services are unacceptable to dik and librarians are urged not to cooperate in
suggesting cuts in services and manpower. sff expects little from the public
library commission, on which it is not represented.

therapeutic value and side-effects of, and necessity for drugs in hungary are
supervised by the national institute of pharmacy, with circulation authorised
by the ministry of health. registration is carried out by the national
institute, which also determines the qualitative requirements of the product
and confirms the factory's use and dosage instructions. drug documentation is
handed over after preclinical and clinico-pharmacological examinations, and
includes antecedents of the active agents and vehicles, and data on toxicity,
and carcinogenic and mutagenous properties. registration is an important
factor for export-most countries register hungarian drugs only after they have
been registered already in hungary. foreign acknowledgement and circulation of

contends that the present far-reaching scope and variety of bibliographic and
library activity at the international level, as manifested in the work of many
different kinds of international organisation, are possible only because of
the emergence after world war i of an international community which did not
previously exist. suggests why, in the profession of librarianship, the league
of nations organization for intellectual cooperation became the symbol of and
centre for this community rather than the palais mondial or mundaneum, created
by paul otlet and henri lafontaine in brussels over 20 years before.

reports on the swedish library association's annual meeting in kiruna, june
81. libraries were accused of fixating on loan figures and neglecting quality.
protests against cuts in library expenditure and calls for a library law have
come from publishers, authors and trade unions, as well as librarians. but the
public library commission's remit does not include proposals for a law, nor
may it recommend action which involves further expenditure. it is foremost an
examination of the status quo. it hopes to draw on the findings of the dala
project, a literature campaign starting in autumn 81. an account of the
videogram commission's work was given; stress was laid on the positive aspects
of video, such as greater availability of rare and unpopular films and aids
for minorities. a distribution network for serious video production involving
libraries was called for. a resolution against the introduction of lending
fees and for a library law was rejected as unani mity among representatives

in the 1980s, bulgarian libraries must meet the communist party requirements
to become important contributors not only to the country's technological
progress but also to the population's aesthetic education. to become equal
partners in the national information system, scientific libraries have to
reassess the potential for, and the means of implementing library cooperation
and coordination in respect of building up their book collections. acquisition
of publications and periodicals from the capitalist countries must, in
particular, be planned very carefully considering the foreign currency
resources. on the other hand, libraries must consider as the 1st and foremost
duty the dissemination of information regarding the achievements of the ussr
and other socialist countries from which publications are freely available.
interlibrary lending must be backed up and expedited by efficient telex and
photocopying services. well-kept b ibliographic resources not only have
information value but they also help in attracting new readers.

soviet libraries have seen a 25% increase in usage over the last 10 years.
this expansion has been accompanied by a significant development of research
into librarianship. resources have been concentrated on the study of some of
the very real problems of library growth (the social function of libraries,
ways of improving both ideological and information work, organising library
systems on the bases of centralisation and cooperation), the number of people
and places involved in research has increased and the system of directing
research has changed with the strengthening of state control and the

the catholic literature centre in the netherlands was created in 1971 from the
katholiek bibliotheek en lectuur centrum (catholic library and literature
centre). the kblc itself was formed in 1968 by the fusion of several older
organisations, including the bond van rooms-katholieke openbare leeszalen en
boekerijen (association of roman catholic public reading rooms and libraries)
and the katholieke centrale vereniging voor lectuurvoorziening (catholic
central society for literature provision). as an extraordinary member of the
nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and
literature) the centre aims to represent the interests of the catholic church
in public library affairs and is especially concerned to promote the interests
of christian organisations, such as the interdenominational peace council, pax

paper presented at the 41st conference of the graduate library school,
university of chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
materials in school and public libraries. though some librarians and teachers
believe censorship is a recent phenomenon, it has been a part of librarians'
lives for more than a century. indeed, many late-19th century librarians
regarded themselves primarily as censors, duty-bound to protect the young from
shoddy and pernicious books, especially fiction. some librarians and teachers
today carry on this censorial tradition by circulating or teaching only works
of high literary merit or the proper moral content. those censoring on
literary grounds often provide only subjective criteria, justifying censorship
by their own personal tastes. those censoring on moral grounds often provide
no better criteria, justifying censorship by their own personal morality. libr
arians and teachers have no right to impose personal literary or moral
standards on the public, young or old. they have a duty to provide materials
of all sorts to allow clients and students to search through and seek out
ideas.

n 1945, vannevar bush wrote an article urging scientists to turn to the task
of making the growing store of knowledge more accessible. (as we may think,
2atlantic monthly1 176 (1) 101-108). one device in particular which he urged
for development was the memex-'a machine that should be an extension of the
personal memory and body of knowledge belonging to an individual, and should
work in a fashion analogous to the working of the human brain-by association
rather than by categorical classification'. assesses the impact of bush's
ideas on the field of information retrieval, using both quantitative and
qualitative analysis. the 1945 article has been widely cited and has been used
as a symbol for a number of concepts.

in dealing with theories of information rather than of documentation, one
needs to use the same logarithmic measures in information retrieval as are
used in the analysis of the internal information processes of the computer.
one would then be dealing with information objectively throughout, rather than
a mix of objective and subjective measures. information 2per se1 is an empty
concept. man needs to learn how to relate information more directly to
knowledge, as a 1st step observing the growth of knowledge structures in
compact fields of science. a firmer metaphysic for such studies is needed.

publications illustrate the wide coverage of its activities' cataloguing
rules, library planning, education, automation, pr material. it does not act
as a traditional trade union, but the pressure on its office for library
personnel resources to take up the matter of unequal pay is strong, especially
from younger women, and the office is now publishing annual surveys of
salaries. in line with this, the ala is boycotting states who have not
ratified the equal rights amendment, a decision which has caused friction in
the association. although the reagan administration has meant cuts for

in berlin the library school is now completely integrated into the university
as part of the communication science faculty, the 1st time that this has
occurred in germany. objections to university status for librarianship courses
were formerly made on the grounds that the librarianship courses occupy only 6
semesters where other university courses require 8 or 9 and that a university
course would provide inadequate practical training. if librarianship is to be
regarded as part of communication science new theoretic fields must be
developed which will affect librarianship training. librarians must be trained
in critical media selection and information dissemination; in public
librarianship personal communication between staff and readers must be
improved to counteract the impersonal effects of increasing centralisation.
librarians need a better general education and knowledge of connected academic
subjects like sociology and psychology.

library education has been part of the us higher education system since 1870.
it remained popular until world war ii and then there was a sudden drop in
popularity. it was revived only in the late 1950s and early 60s. analyses the
library education programme in terms of learning, teaching, curriculum and
evaluation from cognitive, cybernetic and developmental perspectives.
discusses a 3 part programme which was developed and implemented sucessfully
at colgate university. programmes of the pennsylvania state university, ohio
state university and university of denver are also discussed. the experience
of librarians is that it is easy for students to learn the broader concepts of
the usage of the library and do research, rather than remember many titles for
each subject of their research.

in addition to fulltime courses offered by the school of librarianship in
sofia, part-time courses, i.e. in-service courses, help to increase the number
of qualified librarians. from 1960 to 1976, 936 part-time students enrolled,
and 834, i.e. 89%, completed their studies including 16 students from the
cyril and methodius national library. 99% of the students were women, who were
forced frequently to extend their studies beyond 3 years because of maternity
leave, illness and other reasons. in future, the central libraries, in
particular, must help to select suitable candidates as prospective part-time
students. libraries also have a duty to intensify their assistance to enrolled
part-time students, provide help during the course as well as to assist those
students who are preparing for final examinations and theses. only then can
part-time courses gradually become an equivalent to fulltime study.

discusses issues raised in curriculum planning and development for a
postgraduate course in information science. considers information science as
an interdisciplinary subject area concerned with the efficient communication
of its substantive nucleus, information. accordingly, teaching programmes are
required to cover both academic instruction and practical application, with
the curriculum itself serving as a model of efficient communication. the
question then necessarily arises whether courses should be oriented towards
instilling the existing corpus of cognitive information, or in developing
capabilities for dealing with present and future needs. whereas academic
training emphasises the search for truth, professional training requires
preparation for decision making. proposes in conclusion a model of curriculum
organisation encompassing both theory and application.

a comprehensive description of existing services in a southern italian region
before the earthquake in nov 80, showing the total inadequacy of library
provision, and absence of any official recognition of the need for legislative
initiatives and a comprehensive policy to develop services and provide
training for librarians. reliable statistics are unavailable, but sufficient
evidence is presented to demonstrate that both in naples and throughout the
region, the majority of libraries are restricted to university users or other
privileged groups, and public access to reading is extremely limited. any
activities to develop library services have been isolated initiatives, without
recognition of the importance of the role of the library in the community;
expansion is haphazard and the concepts of library cooperation and network
planning utterly unknown. suggestions are made for the creation of regional
centres as a 1st step in ameliorating the situati on. a note calls attention
to the increased urgency for action following destruction of library buildings
by earthquake, and an appendix deals with the problems of rescuing archives
now at risk because of earthquake damage.

the 12th congress of the bulgarian communist party set important targets in
respect of the national economic growth, the result of intensive application
of chemistry, automation and robotics. scientific and technical libraries have
a significant part to play assisting with their services in implementation of
the targets. the majority of young scientists have a good command of at least
1 western language and russian literature is in general use. however, there is
still much to be done to attract scientists and other experts who have been
avoiding libraries so far. personal rapport with such people is decisive and
librarians should draw ideas from instructive publications issued for this
purpose by many central libraries. in addition to books, periodicals, patents,
trade catalogues and secondary information sources have to be utilised to the
full. libraries need equipment to be able to offer to their readers

contribution to a panel debate on public libraries in the 80s, organised by
the danish library inspectorate and held in oct 81. libraries are faced with a
situation in which their use, especially that involving reference services,
grows, while demands for cuts or zero growth are made. librarians have to give
up some services, such as lengthy literature searches, in order to keep a
balance in the general service level and are faced with an invidious choice
between the kinds of material-newspapers, reference books, journals-which have
to be axed. there is a need for an overall planning body which can decide
priorities on professional grounds. argues for strengthening of the reference
sections in smaller libraries by appointment of reference librarians and for
the free distribution of the national bibliography to all publicly owned
libraries. centrally produced reference aids help in the choice of priorities
and free staff for othe r tasks, but more are needed. a period of cuts should
be used to plan future expansion.

interviews the author, per hojholt, who argues that libraries could support
quality literature more effectively by ordering more copies of good books.
instead libraries, giving in to popular demand, contain a surfeit of mediocre
authors. local freedom to select is largely an illusion as in practice the
binding centre's reviews are heavily relied upon. the popularity of
sociological and women's novels should not be ignored entirely, however, as
libraries have an obligation to cater both for quality and topicality. authors
of school and children's books, on the one hand, and of adult books, on the
other, should have their library fees assessed separately. the work of
children's librarians is educational and social and their training should
reflect this; literary quality hardly applies to children's literature.
suggests sale of books in libraries to ensure the survival of the book trade.

describes a visit to the main public library in brixton shortly after the
riots in 1981. the cultural contrast between life in the street and in the
library was striking. brixton serves a population of about 90,000, 25% of whom
are users. the library emphasises outreach services and teamwork among the 20
staff employed by the main and 2 branch libraries. thus the library serves
institutions such as old people's homes, hostels for the homeless, youth
clubs, prisons. help is given to advice centres and 100 people are visited in
their homes. the children's section contained few books and was little used.
the riots had not affected the library and good relations existed with the
young people and their leaders. the stock includes books in many foreign
languages for the immigrant minorities.

the increasing importance of document delivery; and the effects of new
developments on collection growth and management and on the relationship of
the academic library with the parent body and with other libraries. makes
recommendations for' increased access to library holdings through distributed
networks; the improvement of interlibrary loan; the implementation of
cooperative collection management; a reappraisal of collection evaluation
criteria; and the appropriate utilisation of management skills and technology.

the arl-acrl standards for university libraries do not present quantitative
standards, but rather place their emphasis on the performance of university
libraries. through the statistical techniques of correlation and regression,
discriminant analysis, and principal component analysis it is possible to
analyse university library data and to derive minimal criteria that
statistically distinguish university libraries from other kinds of academic
libraries. these criteria look very much like standards, but still fail to
relate library size and resources deployed to library performance.

the fate of i.s. turgenev's paris library, containing 3,000 volumes, remains
unresolved. only 12 volumes definitely survive. in 1897, turgenev's
compatriots asked his heiress, polina viardot to donate books from turgenev's
paris library to the orlovsk provincial museum. she denied possessing the
library. turgenev had 1643 russian books in paris, 816 german, 147 english and
246 french. a note in a turgenev ex-libris mentions his russian books were
sold in leipzig. occasionally turgenev's books return from oblivion and arrive
in the orlov i.s. turgenev museum. the surviving books from turgenev's paris

divided into sections, dealing respectively with hospital services,
domiciliary services, and services for the visually handicapped, the mentally
handicapped, and the deaf. the survey leads to the conclusion that the
mentally handicapped and the deaf are the most neglected groups. the
importance of public library initiatives, especially in the u.s.a. and canada,

discussion of the role of the library in relation to the school in italy. with
growing acceptance that the public library should promote cultural activities
as well as make books available, the lack of any coherent organisational
structure at national or local level coordinating activities in the public
domain becomes very noticeable, particularly where schools and libraries are
concerned in promoting reading habits. the situation at present is one of
repressed rivalry, where roles are undefined. the divergent attitudes of
teachers and librarians are discussed, with reference to reading in the
context of the spread of audio-visual media.

a paper presented at the 41st conference of the graduate library school,
university of chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
materials in school and public libraries. in the history of public library
services in the us, numberless regulations have been established to determine
what kinds of service should be provided for children and what limitations
should be placed on those services and on the use of materials in the library.
as facilities for sharing information have grown, so have questions about
children's access to such technological advances as data bases and to
interlibrary loan programmes. in 1967, the american library association
revised the 2library bill of rights1 to ensure that library use not be denied
individuals because they are minors. little research has been done on how the
intention of this action has been implemented or ignored. evaluates 1
library's approach to access for children, examining policies, regulations,
practices, and coordinations that affect such access.

the landshut library system comprises 3 public libraries which are also school
libraries, 1 hospital library and 9 school libraries, all administered by a
central library responsible for all purchasing and processing. the needs of
8,000 pupils are catered for in 12 primary and secondary schools, 1 special
school, 2 vocational schools and 2 colleges of further education. 123 classes
visit the libraries weekly and special help is given to foreign children. aims

after the 2nd world war, west germany continued as it left off in 1933, with
factory libraries in the old patriarchal form and library policies with
traditional bourgeois ideals. in east germany, however, a period of
denazification and rebuilding of society in a socialist form followed the war.
libraries received high priority in the anti-fascist propaganda campaign, with
access to libraries in 96% of districts in 1957 compared to 40% in 1947. a
purge of library books was carried out on stalinist principles with some
libraries losing up to 90% of their stock. however, the public library system
expanded rapidly, but without deviation from the ideological line in book
selection. a network of workplace libraries under the trade unions has also
been developed in keeping with the importance attached to libraries for
ideological education. the basis for these libraries is the maxim' all workers
must read. th e libraries must reach a certain norm in lending figures and
control with the material borrowed is possible. the workplace libraries, far
from being an expression of working class democracy, are an ideological
instrument of the trade union leadership directed at the working class.

a translation from the original french of a paper by the directrix of the
french joy through books programme, founded in 1963 to develop children's
libraries. discusses the importance of reading in relation to the
proliferation of audio-visual media, from the viewpoints of both the
recreational and informational advantages offered. in the library, the child
is free to choose his own reading material, and it is here that the mediation
of an adult is essential to ensure the young initiate is encouraged in his
enthusiasms, in learning how to use and enjoy books, and in appreciating the
relationship between reading and life. without the intervention of the
librarian, the library can only be a distribution centre.

all types of libraries (school, public and trade union) have to impart the
ideas of the 12th communist party congress to the entire bulgarian nation. the
communist congress outlined economic, social and cultural policies which have
to be implemented by workers in industry and in agriculture acting in a
disciplined and responsible way. librarians must use a systematic and personal
approach and deal with the class struggle, the role of the ussr in the world,
the general international situation and many other topics on all the required
levels. librarians should display relevant literature, arrange exhibitions and
discussion meetings, and compile recommended bibliographies. these are only a
few suggestions which must be implemented to reach the set goals.

in the course of bulgaria's turbulent history, much of her national literary
heritage was destroyed. there are also numerous items which enrich the
collections of libraries and museums abroad. in spite of that the collections
of ancient manuscripts in bulgaria today are still an invaluable source of
research. scholars when studying the lavish illuminations, find not only new
information on the national literary and cultural history, but also on the
arts. nowadays, the cyril and methodius national library in sofia proudly
possesses the larger collections of ancient manuscripts reaching 1400 items.
the academy of sciences' central library, the library at the rilskij monastery
national museum, the ivan vazov national library in plovdiv, the regional
historic museum at veliko turnovo, as well as some others also have

the educational media programmes, staffing, and budgets of 27 community

services offered. most washington community colleges have integrated
library-media programmes. less than half of the state colleges and
universities in oregon have integrated library-media programmes. media staff
size appears to be larger in oregon with respect to the ratio of staff to
students but smaller in terms of the ratio of staff to faculty. although the
overall media dollars spent per student are not much different between the 2
states, the washington community colleges have a more generous budget for

describes the work of arhus public libraries' av department, opened in dec 80.
the equipment includes record players, tape recorders, screens for slides and
transcript readers for enlargement of text. the stock includes books with
tapes, talking books for adults and children, art slides, non-musical records
and cassettes, easy readers, pictorial works and magnaprint books. the users
are the blind and partially sighted, mostly the elderly, and those with
reading difficulties, mostly children and young people. not all materials,
e.g. the language courses and art slides, are aimed at the handicapped.
library service to the handicapped places greater demands on the staff than
other lending services. few users are able to help themselves to material and
need assistance from the staff; most material needs to be examined and played
before borrowing and checking on return. the department buys published
editions of books cum tapes, and also records suitable books itself, but
demand for material is far from being satisfied.

describes the experience of 3 us public libraries with video. the activities
centred around development of a video collection and production of programmes
with the library's own equipment. donnell's public library, new york, was one
of the first to build up a video collection; its film study center, begun in
1958, expanded in 1975 with the establishment of the video center. the center
has 700 titles and access to 200 non-commercially produced programmes. boulder
public library, colorado, has a media department with 250 videograms of a wide
variety and its own video production. in 1978 it began to set up a video
reference centre for colorado. fort washington public library, near new york,
has had a media workshop, media port, since 1973, consisting of a photo, video
and film workshop, art department, and media reference centre. the aim of the
workshop is to give the local population a chance to express themselves
through these media. transmission of locall y produced programmes by the
library on the local tv is planned. the importance of video in libraries to
ensure distribution of non-commercial products was everywhere acknowledged.

operation, at regional and local levels' university, church, school, local and
private. the inequality of service provision is demonstrated, and the need for
a regional policy involving creation of new libraries and rationalisation of
existing resources shown. the operation of urban library systems in bologna
and modena is described, and the projected network service, based on

manuscripts and music from the public archives to the national library,
insisting on the retention of the division of material between the 2
institutions according to physical form, not subject matter. shows how the
present arrangement came into being by intention, not accident; the
unnecessary expense involved in creating an archive section at the national
library; and the irrelevance of foreign models to the canadian situation.

stages in the development of inter-library cooperation in the ussr can be
traced over the last 30 years. cooperation is of 3 types' within the framework
of a department; involving libraries from several departments but on the same
site or in the same economic field; or without any such boundaries. the key
element is integration' the planned combination of resources from different
libraries to ensure their effective exploitation. this is the basis for the
formation of a regional library network. in the long-term, such integrated
systems will have an increasingly important role to play in soviet
librarianship.

the beginning of cooperation and coordination in scandinavia in the sphere of
librarianship, bibliography and information can be seen in the theoretical
studies of the 1950s. it was then that the scandia-plan, an intergovernmental
plan of coordinated acquisitions of foreign literature, was started. research
into cooperation has developed along 3 main levels-national, scandinavian and
international-and this approach is reflected in the research methods employed.
mathematical methods are used in scandinavian studies and statistical
mathematics are the norm on the international level. the scandinavian success
in library cooperation deserves greater attention on the part of soviet
librarians.

the calculation of the costs of a network, the calculation of the gross
benefits for the whole network, the stability of the network. concentrates on
the 1st and last of these subjects. coalitions are compared in a systematic
way by 1st defining coalitions and introducing the concept of a division. the
latter is defined as a unique combination of coalitions such that every
participating library is a member of 1 and only 1 coalition and the division

in denmark the public library is the centre of communication and culture,
since there is more emphasis here than in germany on theatrical and musical
activities. libraries are built mainly from wood, slate and glass, with a
structure designed to suit a wide range of activities; they are always
situated centrally within their area. puppet theatres, toys, facilities for
painting and listening to music and even little push-chairs for the smallest
children are provided in libraries with a large proportion of child readers.
all libraries contain at least one room for meetings. basic stocks always
contain german and english language material and talking books for the old and
partially sighted. books are taken out to the housebound and handicapped;
libraries even supply children's books for use in paediatricians'

the aim of the communist party of bulgaria is to transform all bulgarian
citizens into harmonious personalities. this effort requires substantial
participation by libraries, both public and special. the number of readers and
frequency of loans must be monitored. thus librarians must become familiar not
only with their readers' interests but also with the details of the literature
presented to them. librarians must not be left alone but assisted and guided
even more than before by expert advisers, working in particular at the
methodological centres of regional central libraries. their work must be
adapted to the new, much more complicated requirements of the 1980s and be
more efficient, too. bureaucracy and formalism have to be eliminated,
activities much better coordinated. the cyril and methodius national library
in sofia must retain leadership in this field.

high rate inflation in periodical subscription prices without adequate budget
increments force many libraries to freeze new subscriptions and in many cases
to cancel subscriptions. the process of deselection raises the question of
which titles will be retained and which will be discontinued. suggests that
the evaluation of the relative importance of the various titles will be done
by using a cost efficiency formula. the formula combines 2 factors, the price
of subscription and the measured use of the journal, and ranks periodicals in
a given collection in a descending order' at the top will be the most
cost-efficient title and at the bottom the least cost-efficient title. this
formula was tried in conjunction with a use study of the judaica reading
room's ohio state university libraries during 1978.

function. argues that rationalisation of subject interests and subjects taught
by the universities in an area should lead to more efficient use of resources.

according to a report issued in april 81 by the research secretariat, denmark
lags behind other european countries in its support for research, both public

the consequences of the cuts both for libraries and their mother institutions;
it shows that the libraries use less than 10% of the expenditure on research.
includes comments on the report by the executive committee of the joint
council of research libraries. the committee supports the conclusion that the
research libraries' economic problems should be solved in conjunction with,
and preferably before, any change in their structure and management. it points
out that figures for running costs of research libraries under the cultural

paper presented at a conference on reading materials for library education,
west berlin, 15-20 dec 80. in the underdeveloped countries the average citizen
is poor and illiterate and 90% of the population lives in rural areas, where
transport and communication services are extremely limited. in most
underdeveloped countries the financial budget allocated to library staff and
bookstock is extremely limited. in addition, in some countries considerable
sums have been spent on the construction of city libraries to u.k. and u.s.a.
standards with a consequent reduction in funds for rural areas. the available
resources should be divided more evenly to provide improved services
throughout the entire country.

examines the state of libraries in the uk. during the last 5 years public
libraries especially have been subject to cuts resulting in fewer
acquisitions, closure of branches, reduced opening hours and freezing of staff
posts. at the same time attempts are made to increase income through increased
fines and sale of discarded material and pamphlets, although lending fees have
not yet been imposed. introduction of automation in libraries is seen by many
as a means of reducing staff expenditure and improving services to the public,
especially commerce and industry. the library provision for children, never
very good compared to danish public libraries, has been struck particularly
hard by the cuts. the reaction against the cuts has been led by nalgo in the
form of work stoppages and by the library association as protests to the
authorities.

interviews jan gumpert, director of the swedish library service, who discusses
the impact of cuts on the libraries. local authorities are finding their
cultural budgets, with libraries as the largest item, easy targets. attempts
are made to save the book budget as far as possible and cuts are made instead
in opening hours and activities. vacancies are likely to be frozen. for the
library service the cuts mean that the stock of older titles will have to be
reduced, but there are no plans to cut the number of titles offered. export of
library furniture to the arab world alleviates somewhat the lack of markets in
sweden. the service's computer system, bums, is now installed in 34 local
authorities. there is close cooperation with the research libraries'
automation system libris. discusses the impact of the literature commission

branch libraries have been opened and special services have been initiated,
such as mobile library services, record libraries and services to foreign
workers and open school students. in addition, the dutch government plans to
increase the number of regional support libraries from 13 to 19. however,
enschede public library, which has been designated a regional support library,
is compelled by financial cutbacks to reduce its present staffing levels by
25%. as a result the library will be unable to maintain the current volume of
loans and consideration has been given to limiting the number of books which a

libraries, despite their tradition-minded reputation, always were sensible
about the technical aspects of their duties and open to innovations.
consequently the application of computer techniques here is discussed. these
systems usually are not developed on unique principles for library purposes,
but have been adapted from principles already existing in other applications.
some of these principles are more apt for application in libraries than others
regarding the special duties of libraries towards their users. this fact today

describes evanston public library's automation system. in 1978 the library
installed an on-line issue control system by clsi. with author and title data
already in the data base, the introduction of an on-line public access
catalogue with a touch sensitive terminal, opened in oct 80, was facilitated.
the card catalogue is, however, being maintained, as the input of subject data
is not yet complete and as a safeguard against computer break-downs. the extra
costs involved had not been foreseen, and savings on staff are not yet
possible. it is, therefore, difficult to calculate the long-term savings from
automation. the professional gains are, however, clear' the catalogue enables
precise location of material and compilation of useful statistics, and
simplifies alterations. moreover, terminals can be placed outside the library,
in the town hall and educational institutions.

satisfactory performance. the need for a balanced use of the facilities,
coverage of subject areas, provision for divergent views, and encouragement of
free enquiry leads to the suggestion that treatment rather than ideas is what
the librarian is best qualified to assess. pornography is discussed in
relation to this and other criteria. the growth of open learning is seen as
demanding a positive tutorial approach. the need for moral courage is
affirmed.

leadership by those not in positions of authority in libraries has usually
been discussed in terms of participation in management. a number of other
models are given' participation and feedback models, including the evaluation
of superiors; models of confrontation and risk taking, including action to
overcome mismanagement and assertion of employees' rights; and models for
change agents, including use of staff organisations, informal action networks,
and resource exchange networks. the theory is that a 'servant leadership' by
lower and middle level staff may promote service by libraries and also
increase attention to the importance of the work to the staff themselves. the
action models should be tested and related to a career-stage model which
identifies power and influence by those who are not managers.

interviews marion porro, president of the trade union for library employees in
new york. the organisation of library employees in the usa has not been very
successful and today only about 10% of employees, mostly in the large urban
public libraries, are union members. this is, however, in line with the
general scepticism towards the trade union movement among americans in general
and the professions in particular. the ala has on the whole had an ambiguous
attitude to trade union matters. the trade union in new york, the new york
library guild, or local 1930, established in 1968, has about 1500 members and
almost total coverage. it negotiates 2 yearly agreements on pay and conditions
and deals with grievances, but does not participate in the library
professional decision-making. on a wider front, the union is engaged in
various social protest movements, but no cooperation with other trade unions
for library employees takes pl ace.

3 articles which describe orebro's new library, opened aug 81. eva viirman
describes how in 1976, a list of cultural objectives for a library service,
its functions and user groups were handed to the architects, who worked out a
proposal on the basis of these. the library shares the building with the local
council's cultural and educational committees, the resources and av centres.
describes the layout of the library. the large information desk is centrally
placed. close to this are the periodicals and exhibition areas, catalogues and
reference works. on one side of a passage lies the book hall with 60,000
volumes of fiction and non-fiction and 70 seats; on the other lie specialised
departments. in the basement are study carrels and stacks with 200,000
volumes. in all, an open and well arranged library. the architect, hugo hoije
describes how the aims of flexibility and openness are met by a construction
without supporting walls. the angular shaped exterio r follows the traditional
inner city plan and creates a yard for service vehicles. ants viirman
describes the preparations for the move to the new library, which included a
total survey of the media stock and some withdrawals, and the move itself.

children and young people, containing 30,000 volumes which were moved here
when premises in the municipal library became too small. the 1st floor houses
the municipal art gallery, specialising in german paintings from 1850 onwards
and the 2nd floor the local history collection. there are also rooms for
meetings, film shows and painting sessions, offices, a cafeteria and a media

despite recent increases in stocks and readership, public libraries must
attain even higher standards of achievement. public libraries are used by only
a small proportion of industrial and agricultural workers, apprentices and
schoolchildren; one way to encourage more of them to use libraries could be to
make opening hours longer and more convenient for them, especially in the
evening. libraries could reserve the mornings and early afternoons for
administrative and processing work and then open to the public at least till 6
p.m., depending on local conditions. all departments for public use should be
open simultaneously and staff training must be developed so that expert
assistance is always available to the public.

outlines an approach, with both widespread implications and specific practical
steps, for assembling some of the data that library administrators now require
in order to make libraries operate more effectively. these data have not been
assembled in the past because the costs in staff time alone have been and
continue to be prohibitive for most institutions. one major impediment to
effective library administration is the lack of a comprehensive management
information system. some investigators in this area seem to have become
fascinated with the potential value of various elusive and fugitive library
statistical measures, but they have given little attention to the operational

dealing with industrial catalogues has been in operation. in addition to
catalogues, the collections include prespectuses, technical information
leaflets, technical specifications, pricelists, production programmes, works
bulletins, company reports and the like. the collections are not only a source
of invaluable information on new technology but are referred to, for example,
whenever new products are planned and designed. the section is headed by the
state scientific and technical library of the ussr, where the bulletin 2new
industrial catalogues1, containing 19 series, is published twice a month. its
industrial catalogues' collection is made up of 100,000 items. in bulgaria,

criteria. these compounds, taken from the nci collection, were ranked
according to predicted probability of activity. the results showed 34% of the
active compounds in the top 10% of the ranking. in a second study the
predictive ability of a chemist and the computer were compared by having each

paper presented at the 41st conference of the graduate library school,
university of chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
materials in school and public libraries. in order to guarantee children
access to information, we must' establish the appropriate resource-sharing
arrangements; grant children the right to participate in them; and include
children's materials and resources in the developing data systems. current
studies reveal that, although as children reach junior high age they use the
public library predominantly for school projects, neither school nor public
libraries are important in the child's total pattern of information seeking.
lack of transportation, time, and school assignments based on library
resources contribute to this pattern. while multiple cooperatives such as
those developing in colorado and being initiated in new york are of interest
and show promise, large-scale failure to develop inter- and intralibrary loan
policies and procedures which include children and young adults as users
further inhibit access by the young. as of this time, little of the massive
amount of curricular, historical, textual, or literary materials for children
are being included in developing automated data bases and systems, thus
denying their access to adults as well as to youth. in fighting the battle of
access for the young, librarians must develop broader competencies in the
areas of management and communications technology.

research based at the university of bath, uk, during 1967-75 (including the
investigation into information requirements of the social sciences (infross)

numerous, uncoordinated, often poorly designed, and greatly underused.
obstacles to improvement include the non-commercial nature of many services,
relatively small and poor market, main buyers (libraries) not being the users,
and generally little incentive. in the long term, a totally automated system
could be the solution. meanwhile, libraries can improve the situation by

automation of most technical routines. under development is the library user
information service, (luis), a system which allows on-line searching in the

19%-20% of stock; natural science, mathematics and medicine 6%-7%; technology
and agriculture-each 6%; art and sport-6%-7%; fiction-48%-50%; linguistics,
literature, geography and general-8%. literature of the last 5 years should
comprise 50% of stock. correspondence of the stock's subject content with
readers' requirements is revealed by comparing its subject structure with that

proposes that public librarians, in selecting popular fiction, abolish the
conflict between high values and 'low' tastes by formulating selection plans
in which value is instrumental-conditional upon the degree to which a work of
fiction meets or fails to meet identified needs. in this way they will come to
understand the ways in which existing works serve the reading public's needs,
and serve the public better.

paper presented at the 41st conference of the graduate library school,
university of chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
materials in school and public libraries. a reviewer looks at selection,
description, and criticism of the children's books which she must decide to
recommend or not recommend for library purchase. woven throughout the
discussion is a personalised account of experiences that force the reviewer to
consider the whole range of possible reactions to controversial material from
viewpoints of children, parents, librarians, educators, publishers, authors,
and artists. in addition to the nature of the book and the prospective reader
the reviewer needs to take into account her own preparation and experience for
evaluating and reviewing each book.

examines the costs and benefits of purchasing periodicals on a 1-year versus a
3-year subscription basis. the decision problem is viewed as a capital
budgeting problem where the objective is cost minimisation over a 6-year time
span. the variables considered critical to the decision include cost of
capital, subscription reorder cost facing the library, annual rate of change
of subscription rates, and ratio of 3-year to 1-year subscription costs. the
model was developed and applied with the assistance of library managers at the
university of rochester. results of the study indicate that, even under those
conditions most favourable to maintaining a 1-year subscription policy,
substantial savings can accrue by shifting to a 3-year subscription policy.

bases in collection development activities. presents the methods and results
of a survey of us special libraries and medium sized research libraries
designed to ascertain the extent of the use of on-line data bases in selection
and collection evaluation. concludes that on-line data bases are being
primarily used for bibliographic verification as part of the selection
process, and that very little use in collection evaluation was reported,
although its potential was acknowledged. describes a recent evaluation of

in 1953 the law, originally promulgated by the british mandatory government,
was amended. as it now stands, publishers must deposit 5 copies of each new
book within 1 month, as follows' 1 to the ministry of education and culture, 1
in the israel state archives, 1 in the knesset library and 2 in the jewish
national and university library (jnul). the present law does not cover
non-book material; editions are not strictly defined; there is no way to prove
delinquency in deposit of books during the statutory period of 1 month; the
fines are not high enough to deter publishers; and the procedures for
instigating legal action are in themselves a deterrent against such action.

system of duplicates exchange has now been established and the exchange of
microfilms has increased, 1 area of exchanges not yet functioning smoothly is
official publications. a more unified approach will have to be developed
before the system can become fully effective. the working group set up to
investigate the position of the copyright deposit presented their
recommendation to produce a model of the copyright deposit law for socialist
countries as the model produced by the ifla's section on national libraries
does not suit the conditions of multinational and federal countries and
socialist countries in general.

national loan/photocopy collection at the national library of australia
(n.l.a.) for current journals, supported by a highly selective union list.
access to locations for dead titles and last runs would be through a less
volatile union catalogue covering 60-70 libraries. reports would be supplied
from a single centre for the whole country. likewise, central provision for
books would be made by the n.l.a., supported by a union catalogue covering
those libraries with significant unique holdings and intake.

2 australian special librarians give their views on interlibrary loans. moya
mckenzie looks at the impact of computerised information retrieval, union
catalogues, telecommunications, delivery systems, interloan 2versus1 purchase,
concluding that the demand for interloans will continue, becoming a greater
burden on large libraries with fine core collections, and that some libraries
with greater financial resources may opt for obtaining material direct from
the emanating body as being more reliable and cheaper in the long run. myvanwy
emery describes the formal, informal and 'backdoor' approaches to interloans
between special libraries and the problems of availability of material and
passing the real costs on to the consumer.

there is widespread recognition that the costs of interlending are unequally
distributed, and some north american libraries are already attempting full or
partial cost recovery. puts the case for recouping of interloan costs. looks
at potential revenue sources, cost recovery, cost accounting and the impact of
technology.

.I 3334
.W
argues against the concept of cost recovery for interloans on the grounds that
this would impede the free flow of information in the community, and that the
disabilities of the large net lending libraries should be eased in other ways
such as special subsidy, a wider spread of demand over a greater number of
libraries as bibliographic networks develop, improved training of interloan
officers and possibly by the establishment of an australian national lending
library of 1st resort.

the cost of maintaining a library collection is high. while librarians welcome
bequests, they are worried about costly conditions such as keeping the bequest
intact or not selling it. libraries are increasingly using outside subject
experts to weed their collections. for reasons of propriety, most discarded
books are sold at auctions. libraries also send valuable books and manuscripts
to auctions to obtain funds for specific purposes. offers advice concerning
the decision to weed a collection, explains the procedure for contacting a

oclc's online union catalog (oluc) contains bibliographic records created
under various cataloguing guidelines. until dec 80, no system-wide attempt had
been made to resolve record conflicts caused by use of the different
guidelines. the introduction of the new guidelines, aacr2, exacerbated these
record conflicts. to reduce library costs, which might increase dramatically
as users attempted to resolve those conflicts, oclc converted name headings
and uniform titles in its data base to aacr2 form.

authority records, and especially the conversion of about 40% of the headings
in the bibliographic file, has been of great benefit to the library,
significantly speeding up the cataloguing operation.

library automation began in 1965 with the first marc pilot project initiated
by the library of congress and soon taken up by the british national
bibliography. international standards have been drawn up to secure worldwide
use of the system, culminating in the attempt to create universal
bibliographic control. however, exchange of international bibliographic data
has been beset by problems, so that international use of machine readable
information is not very widespread. the use of international, english language
based standards and exchange of actual tape have caused problems in
scandinavia. for these reasons bibliographic service centres, 'utilities',
have been set up in usa and england, an idea which is also behind the danish
systems samkat and biblioteksdata. the largest is the us oclc, which began in
1967. its main task is development of a bibliographic data base and
decentralised cataloguing, which supplies the base with 60, 000 titles
annually from 4,000 terminals. it also operates an interlending system, and
hopes to add accessions and issue control systems to the services. the main
product is catalogue cards. with the establishment of 'oclc europe', danish
libraries will have to take a stand for or against cooperation with it.

describes chicago public library's automation system. in 1974 the library
joined the oclc network and today all technical departments are automated. the
users meet automation through the com catalogue (computer output microfilm), a
system regarded as much cheaper than an on-line catalogue. there were many
teething troubles involved in the initial use of the catalogue, particularly
in the branch libraries, and the automated acquisition system led to a very
tight budget control over the branches. although new editions of the com
catalogue take longer to arrive than promised it has led to improved
interlending service. the public, however, continue to use the old
discontinued card catalogue as, it was claimed, they are not interested in the
library service's total holdings, but only in the stock of the library branch
used. the staff, too, despite lack of organised opposition, expressed
criticism of the automation programme.

paper presented at a workshop on aacr2. discusses the pros and cons of
adopting the new rules and examines alternative methods of implementation.
these methods include' closing card catalogues and starting automated book,
microfilm or on-line catalogues; linking old and new forms of heading in the
card catalogue; and selective revision of older headings. the special problems
of catalogues separated by alphabet are treated, and some of the new library
of congress practices based on options in aacr2 which affect judaica/hebraica
cataloguing are noted. the use of authority files to control variant forms of
heading is stressed, and future trends in automated cataloguing are
considered.

the formal commitment of the british library to aacr2 and dewey 19 entailed
substantial changes to the uk marc format, the blaise filing rules, and a

file conversion involved not only headings but also algorithmic conversion of
the descriptive cataloguing.

the national reference system for periodicals and serials is the periodical
data bank at the german library institute and the state library of prussian
cultural heritage in berlin. the data bank contains title data on 180,000
german and foreign periodical articles with 500,000 location references. to
improve the supply of periodical articles over the short term the following
measures are necessary' the acceleration of cataloguing of all periodical
collections in all types of libraries involved in the national literature
supply system; the data collections of other periodical reference systems
should be included in the data bank; title data in the periodical data bank
should be compared with that supplied by subject information services with a
view to acquiring missing titles; the data bank should be concentrated in an
on-line information bank. an efficient on-line system would event ually lead
to users being able to order periodicals directly and being referred to the
nearest relevant library.

lecture given at the annual conference of the verein der bibliothekare an
offentlichen bibliotheken (association of librarians in public libraries) west
germany, may 81. librarians have been discussing the idea of unified keyword
cataloguing rules for over 50 years and the subject cataloguing committee of
the deutsches bibliotheksinstitut (german library institute) has recently
produced a report on this subject. since subject cataloguing problems have
been neglected for decades and subject cataloguing carried out by many
individual libraries has resulted in the wasting of work time, super-regional
cooperation in this sphere offers attractive prospects. if regional union
catalogue systems and centralised services took over all subject cataloguing,
rational rules and procedures would result. keyword catalogues are becoming
more and more popular and the creation of unified rules will demand more
intensive work by librarians.

former attempts to classify fiction concentrated on literary genres and one
such attempt in the roskild, (denmark) library is briefly reviewed. the holon
librarians decided to build a subject catalogue for fiction which can be
readily used by readers as well as librarians. a basic list of subjects was
drawn up and additional ones added as works of fiction were processed. it was
found that some fiction cannot be classified by subject, while other works
receive 2 or more subject cards. the classification was carried out in 2
stages; at first only books currently received were classified, and later the
existing fiction collection was processed in the same fashion. the lists of
subject headings in hebrew and english are appended.

classification has been in use. it is to some extent based upon that in use at
vienna's university and polytechnic, and the new method of selecting and
standardising subject headings is described. there are also indexes of
personal names (as subjects of theses, not authors), and place names. indexing
is done manually, computerised indexing being too expensive. cumulations will

reactions of users to precis (preserved context index system) subject indexing
in british education index were studied by structured interviews as part of a
wider survey of precis user reaction in the uk. findings are presented in
terms of ease of use, effective retrieval of citations, whether too much
information is provided in entries, the structure of index entries and the
relationship between terms, and the possibility of a '1-stage' index.
conclusions are that in a specialised field like education a sophisticated
indexing technique cannot obviate the indexer's specialised subject knowledge,
but that the basic principles of precis are not under attack, and entries
should not be further simplified. a majority considered precis better than the
publication's previous indexing method.

paper presented at the conta conference, bielefeld, 24-27 may 81. discusses
the objectives and compilation of the proposed integrated thesaurus of the
social sciences, which is intended to act as a master reference tool, as an
aid in searching across data bases, or a switching mechanism. the 1st step in
compilation should be the merging of terms to form a descriptor bank. to
compare the merged terms at the concept level, analysis in sub-fields is
proposed within a classification framework, preferably 1 with a faceted
structure, such as the 2nd edition of the 2bliss bibliographic classification.
1the classification would serve as the master against which the terms from the
merged information languages, arranged in a compatibility matrix, would be
compared. the master classification would be modified during interaction with
the matrix terms, and emerge as the integrated thesaurus in a format similar
to that of the bsi root thesaurus, having a d etailed classified display and
full alphabetical section. provides an example worked out in the sub-field of
unemployment using terms from 5 thesauri and the udc. also considers
multilingual implications, testing and updating.

describes progress to date in the development of backend machine architecture
for large textual data bases or information retrieval systems. outlines the
use of high-speed pattern matching, string processing, and other non-numeric
operations for the basic search module. the investigators have also used a
structured approach and functional separation of the parts of the backend
machine directly related to the high-level query language, which combines a
limited amount of inversion with serial high-speed text processing in a
parallel and distributed fashion.

the fact data base (a model for a new type of information-handling system) is
described in terms of its main data structure (built from units of information
called 'facts') and its conceptual section which manipulates the structure
(the fact machine). its novelty arises from its internal knowledge structure-a
model of the real world described by the data base and representation of
information fed to the machine. this, augmented by information about set
membership, enables the system to use inferential methods in many aspects of
its operation. shows how these features lead to a simple, flexible interface,
both to other computer systems and to 'user friendly' query languages.

an associative file store (afs) is offered as a simple solution to current
problems with on-line information retrieval systems. it would be a
single-instruction multiple-data stream machine, dedicated to associative file
searching while overall control of the system would be entrusted to a
conventional single-instruction single-data stream machine. the associative
parallel processor (a major component of afs) would support 'on-the-fly' file
searching and simplify the indexing problems of directly accessing single
records to that of indicating the most probable scan block for a high recall
of matching records. initial considerations suggest that afs would out-perform
conventional file stores by over 2 orders of magnitude, be simple to maintain,
and offer full free-text retrieval flexibility.

presents a hybrid approach to data base text searching, using the best
features of inversion and streaming searching techniques to minimise data flow
and obtain complete functional capability. the query is broken into 2 parts
based upon the existence of terms (offensive terms) having leading or imbedded
'don't cares'. those documents satisfying the part of the query without
offensive terms are identified via inversion. these documents are accessed and
the offensive terms are searched for via streaming. discusses the results of
the 1st set of simulation runs in which the experimenters performed
sensitivity analysis on machine processing power and % of terms with leading
variable-length 'don't cares'.

one means of reducing information retrieval time is by taking advantage of the
property of inclusiveness of information retrieval systems. when one knows the
system response to a query which is more general in relation to another query,
then in an inclusive retrieval system in order to retrieve the response to the
more specific query it suffices to limit the information retrieval process to
the search of the system response to the more general query. demonstrates the
property of inclusiveness of document retrieval systems where documents are
indexed by unweighted descriptors, and in which query search patterns are
boolean functions of descriptors (systems using the inverted file method, the
canonical structure file-method, or the sequential file method). the paper
presents 3 methods for a determining a partial ordering relation on a set of
boolean search patterns of queries, implying a partial orderi ng on the set of
the system responses to these queries and discusses the adequacy of each
method depending on the information retrieval method used.

automatically updating memory, and answering questions); and describes the
project's computer system, cyfr. cyfr comprises 2 systems. frump (fast reading
understanding and memory program) reads stories from the united press
international news wire and outputs a conceptual representation of the
important events of each story it understands. conceptual summaries concerning
the us secretary of state are sent to cyrus, which fills in contextual

a fast procedure is described for the discovery of the largest substructure
common to the reactant and product molecules in a chemical reaction. once this

information retrieval networks. the experiment tested the concept of a
virtual-system mode of access to a network of heterogeneous interactive
retrieval systems and data bases. an experimental translating computer
interface named conit was developed as a research test vehicle. the interface
was designed to make the basic functions of 3 different bibliographic

changes through pre- and post-test administration of a research questionnaire
to a group of 20 voluntary participants from a small high technology company
before and after a 60-day period of exposure to on-line searching. evaluation
using standard statistical tests indicated that a statistically significant
increase in perceived level of innovation occurred after the subject's

the euronet telecommunications network is a packet based data network
initially provided to enable low cost access to be obtained to scientific,
technical and socio-economic data bases within the european economic
community. it has however served as a means to standardise data communications
protocols throughout the community and has provided a stimulus for
telecommunications administrations to establish not only national networks
which when interconnected will enable the initial euronet network to be
absorbed, but also new services capable of utilising packet switched networks.
the planned availability of these networks on a european scale is now

teletext (bildschirmtext) was 1st shown to the german public by the federal
postal services in 1977. a comparison is made between teletext, video text and
2-way cable television. teletext is particularly useful in libraries; the
equipment can be used directly by readers and information can be obtained from
it at any time. since teletext is a text medium for the speedy provision of
topical information it presents no threat to the book, a medium for reading.
teletext is also useful in library request and loan procedures and its use can
be implemented in stages, resulting in the reduction of costs for work

describes problem areas in the economics of data base vending, bibliographic
data base publishing and primary journal article publishing. discusses data
base hosts; developments in the data base publishing industry; linking texts
and graphics; integrated data base publishing; and research in document
delivery, including a description of the adonis concept. concludes that a much
closer relationship needs to be forged between data base publishers,
librarians and end users to alert, at the earliest possible stage, any
mismatch between application of technology and user acceptability. also
stresses the need for useful and appropriate standards.

a 13-year analysis of the finances of a major data base producer organisation,
which is also a publisher of abstracting and indexing products, indicates
trends regarding the impact that both printed products and data base products
have on the financial status of the organisation. the question of 'migration'
(from printed to on-line data base products) and the fact that expenses have
increased more than income are discussed as they relate to the survival or
growth of data base organisations. since the data base has gone on-line, there
have been significant increases in the data base revenue, connect hours, and
numbers of on-line users. at the same time, there have been decreases in the
number of data base leases and licences, the number of print product
subscriptions, and the excess of income over expenses. in consta nt dollars,
the cost of producing an abstract has decreased, the subscription charge for
printed products has increased only slightly, the lease and license fees have
decreased, royalty charges have increased, and hourly connect fees have
remained steady (even though the size of the on-line file has increased
greatly). the problem is that of maintaining a balanced financial status in
light of increased income from one class of products, decreased income from
another class of products, and increased cost of operation. possible
approaches to ensure economic viability are considered in terms of expenses,
efficiency of operation, marketing, products, services, and pricing. the most
promising approaches lie in the areas of pricing and development of new
products and servi ces. the possibility of developing a consortium of data
base producers for offering on-line services is proposed. there appears to be
no alternative to increasing the prices for on-line users.

the aim of the analysis of the available secondary information sources in the
chemical industry in czechoslovakia is to find a method for the evaluation of
the effectiveness of the information obtained by the information systems used.
they are' chemical abstracts data base, magnetic tape services of ca
condensates (cac), compendex, and the internal bulletin 2synthetic resins 1(in
czech). criteria chosen for the evaluation were as follows' the time lag
between the publication of the primary source and the creation of the
secondary information; and topicality; comprehensiveness; informativeness and
selectiveness in informing; comprehensibility; and physical form. the
evaluation was made from the viewpoint of a small user group from the applied
research section of the chemical industry.

for the printed. for 13 weeks, patrons using the printed index were offered a
free computer search in exchange for evaluating the search. only 39.6%
accepted and 62% of these still planned to refer to the abstracts later, which
are only available in the printed version. the hypothesis that the on-line

paper presented at the 2nd international conference on data bases in the
humanities and social sciences, madrid 16-19 june 80. describes the use of a
computerised text processing system to produce printed and on-line versions of
the bibliographic data bases in history-2historical abstracts1 and 2america'
history and life1. abstracts or citations of books, articles and dissertations
are edited, subject-classified, and subject and author-indexed. the american
bibliographical center's profile index is a computer-assisted, rotated string
index, the vocabulary is a combination of natural language key words and
preferred subject headings selected by editor-indexers. the processing system
comprises keyboarding, extraction of index terms, expansion of abbreviated
index terms to full text, file correction, sorting and photocomposition of
pages. files of bibliographic entries are sorted for use in 1 or more data
bases, and annual index files are merged to product cumulative indexes.

describes 2 approaches, tied together by their conceptual basis in fuzzy set
theory, for representing weighted boolean requests. one represents directly
the importance of component boolean expressions to the user. the other
establishes conditions that must be met before a document can be retrieved.
both may have a place in information retrieval systems-their relative
strengths should appear through empirical investigation.

associative retrieval strategies are especially attractive when a data base
contains information in the form of full text and the collection of texts is
large and changing so fast that no user can be familiar with its contents. the
meter (message extraction through estimation of relevance) system was designed
to apply such strategies effectively and inexpensively for a changing data
base of up to 20,000 messages (texts or documents) of about 2,000 characters
each, with new messages arriving at the rate of 4,000-5,000 daily. it runs on
a dec pdp-11/45 minicomputer without special hardware, with a response time of
about a minute for 5 simultaneous users, and with nearly 24 hours/day access.
describes the system, its basic theory, and its evaluation.

describes a project on informal (natural)/formal (data base query) language
mapping. a basis was developed for processing english-language requests for
information retrieval from an existing dbms (data base management system). the
role of each word in the natural-language query was identified by 2 separate
methods-a learning algorithm and a statistical technique. the programme was
run with a set of 400 sentences from a basic science book. the results, which
were judged to be encouraging, are discussed.

a deterministic nearest-neighbour search algorithm is modified so that the
user can specify a maximum tolerable level of error. this tolerance allows
certain aspects of the algorithm to be handled probabilistically and this, in
turn, allows an improvement in search speed directly related to the level of
error permitted. thus, search time can be traded off against search
effectiveness. results show that the probabilistic algorithm is substantially
faster than the deterministic, with only a very small loss in retrieval
quality.

based on a paper prepared for a classification theory course at case western
reserve university, ohio, a revised version of which was presented at a
canadian classification research group conference, london, ontario, may 78.
describes an investigation into the subject characteristics of document
classes retrieved using goffman's indirect method; how these classes are
similar to, or different from, the classes obtained when a faceted
classification system is applied to the same set of documents; and the
characteristics of the clusters of terms which inter-relate a definable class
of documents. a random sample of 101 entries in the subject indexing section
of 2lisa1, 1976, were used. the results indicate that the indirect method
could have some merit in search strategies in computerised information storage
and retrieval systems based on keywords or a controlled vocabulary.

aids for re-shaping the general administration functions of such a company. an
analysis of the contribution made to a company operation by such specialists
as sales engineers, designers, planning, tooling engineers and accountants
shows that offices are traditionally designed to handle the generation,
transportation and storage of paper. the advent of the computer, v.d.u. and
television link have challenged the role of paper as a communication medium. a
typical organisational structure, arising from development of such a scheme is
suggested together with a block schematic of a typical remotely manned

required. the ramifications of employment methods, project management
problems, motivation and possible methods of remuneration are di scussed.

radical changes can result from the introduction of new office technology into
the workplace. such changes, if brought about without concern for the needs of
the user, will almost certainly result in non optimum performance and an
inadequate return on a substantial investment. studies the interface between
the user and the system and has much to offer in alleviating the problems
which arise when that interface undergoes change. potentially troublesome
areas are identified and the appropriate human factors aspects explained.

this claim by examining in detail the effects of automated systems on the job
content and job satisfaction of 2 types of clerical jobs' production control
and tele-sales. the source of the decline in the quality of working life in
these 2 areas is located not in the technology itself but management aims and

offices are organisational units in which information is processed by people.
it is essential that we understand the attitudes and requirements of these

currently the microwriter is the foundation for a new way of writing in almost
any environment, with only 1 hand, and with the capacity and capability of
being able to store, retrieve, edit, format and transmit written information
either as the printed word, or in convertible machine language. separated from
the microwriter, the 5 finger keyboard could be fitted to conventional
equipment, such as typewriters, word processing units, telex and computers,
giving access to numerous people who have the authority and need to
communicate directly with the equipment, but are unable to master the
operation of the qwerty keyboard efficiently! in these cases the microwriter
keyboard will be a peripheral in addition to the normal keyboard, and the

software of the system, taking into consideration the solution of some
problems of compatibility, portability and system extensibility. the proposed
system can be used as a universal basic core on which one can easily build
larger word processing systems. the user can, by himself, extend his system by
using the same word processing language he uses everyday because of its

electronic mail is likely to become a major business application over the next
few years, but the form it will take is less clear. systems based around
facsimile or communicating word processors could be popular because while
transmitting letters and other documents electronically, they require few

aacr, isbd and isbn. staffing has not been increased proportionately, and
considerable arrears of uncatalogued material exist. the 5-yearly cumulation
for 1971-75 is at present available in machine-readable form only. a
microfiche catalogue of norwegian publications is produced bi-monthly, with
cumulations for 1971-75 and 1976-78. the university library's national
bibliography data base is already partly on-line. indexing of periodical
articles, planned from 1980, will cover 400 periodicals in most subject
fields. newspape r articles cannot be covered meanwhile. the 2bibliography of
norwegian government publications1 (1965-) should soon be incorporated into

extract from a study prepared during 1979-80 for the french ecole nationale
superieure de bibliothecaires. surveys the various ways french publishers try
to bring new books to the attention of potential buyers' publicity launches in
bookshops, direct mailing, media reviews and advertising, and wall posters.
newspaper advertisements are the most favoured form; details are given of how
advertisements are designed, where they are placed, and costs. the technical
and psychological devices used in composing these advertisements are examined
in detail, with particular reference to layout, the relation between visual
and verbal elements, and appeal to consumer values. in conclusion, some
comparison is made between publishers who create publicity to promote specific
titles, and those who emphasise primarily the reputation of the publishing
house itself.

discusses the production of a danish encyclopaedia. the publishers, gyldendal,
hoped to produce an updated version of the esteemed salmonsen, but the project
proved too expensive and a less ambitious 10 volume work has now been
published. a similar lack of a substantial national encyclopaedia led in
sweden to the appointment of a committee by the ministry of education, whose
report is discussed here. it analyses all problems surrounding the publication
of encyclopaedias and concludes that such publication can today only by
undertaken with state support. it stresses the need for a large encyclopaedia
for the acquisition of background information. use will be mainly in
connection with education, in administration and industry, and will be central
in library reference sections. guidelines for the cooperation between
publishers and the state are drawn up, and a publishing timetable of at most
10 years with updating every 10 years is suggested. pub lication as teledata
or on video discs is rejected.

paper presented at the 41st conference of the graduate library school,
university of chicago, 16-17 may 80, children's access to services and
materials in school and public libraries. there are important differences
between a textbook author's agreeing to allow stickers to be placed over
portions of her book found objectionable by a school administration and a
successful writer's agreeing to expurgate portions of his novel to cut costs.
examines these differences by tracing the chain of command of censorship with
which authors must deal from encounters between an author on 1 side and
editors, publishers, teachers, and school administrators on the other.
examples from each link in the chain are illustrated with excerpts from the
author's personal file on censorship, called 'bouboulina'.

'internationalism' as it is used by those in the field of children's
literature in the usa. it is most commonly applied to those activities which
centre on some phase of children's literature outside the country. its use
appears with greater frequency in articles on children's literature and
seminar programmes. examination of children's literature textbooks, themes for
doctoral theses presented 1930-79, and the status of language requirements in

the important role of library science came to be gradually appreciated in

studies in germany. determined to make librarianship a recognised profession,
he campaigned for a national library (established in 1946), taught library
science (basis of department of library science at ankara university), and
helped found the turkish library association in 1949. public and children's
libraries have increased in numbers in the last decade (244 to 700 and 174 to
400). their problems include lack of trained staff and the 180,000 manuscripts
and rare books in their care. university library development has been uneven

worldwide trends in the development of library buildings and their up-to-date
equipment. this broad general knowledge should be pooled for the new,
specified library buildings, and also for the reconstruction, extension and
modernisation of existing libraries. such activities should lead to the

lecture given at the 10th advanced training seminar for librarians at the
herzog august library in wolfenbuttel, feb 81. for years librarians have
argued over the relationships between pure librarianship and administration in
their work, which are particularly important when allotting tasks to the
highest staff grades. librarians feel themselves to be inadequately
represented when questions on university staffing arise and should strive for
better coordination. administration is not part of the academic discipline of
librarianship and close links must be established between this discipline and
the academic librarian. administrative and professional duties for the highest
staff grades, especially for heads of subject departments, must be clearly
defined.

through free access and uap (universal availability of publications), allow
every thinking person to be able to form his or her own opinion of the world
and the society round them. whilst 2slj1 lacks ingenuity and is often

paper presented at the national librarians association-sponsored programme at
the michigan library association, 11 oct 80. argues that in the usa librarians
have been unable to achieve the distinctive status of a profession. they have
no way of making the claim stick that they have crucial skills and knowledge
of vital importance to society. as a result they are an occupational group
unable to increase significantly the economic well being and prestige of
librarianship through traditional professional means. because of library
associations' emphasis on the institution, there is a lack of concentration on
what constitutes the professional basis for librarianship; the associations
have created a situation where the librarian has occupational power without
the growing social problems of professional power.

attacks on public libraries, db, the minister for cultural affairs and other
politicians in his report to df's annual meeting 1981. he also attacked the
new library bill, although this is supported by both the education and the
cultural ministries. the bill proposes 1 overall administration and a
directorate for each of the sectors, public and research. argues that df

of state aid in scandinavia. the 1978 proposal to transfer library services
from the school board to the education ministry has not yet been implemented.
nor has any action been taken on the finance ministerial working party's
report of 1979 on staffing and job distribution in public libraries. a 3 year

provides a review of the development of the leading russian institution in the
field of academic library education, the moskovskii gosudarstvennyi institut
kul'tury (moscow state institute of culture). the institute was established in
1930 and owes its foundation to the personal initiative of n.k. krupskaya, who
laid down the basic structure of the institute as a higher education body
specialising in the training of librarians and bibliographers, established its
aims and objectives and advised on its organisation and management. the
structure of the institute and the courses provided have changed several times
during the 50 years of the institute's existence. these developments are
covered in detail. also describes the bibliographical and information research
programme and resulting publishing activities.

reports on the meeting of the 2 faculties on bibliography (general and

state institute of culture) whose lecturers met to discuss the article in
2sovetskaya bibliografiya1, 4 (1980) by o.p. korshunov on current needs in
bibliographic training. korshunov's suggestions for the reorganisation of
bibliographic courses are expected to have a great effect on the improvement
of bibliographic training in the ussr in future. papers presented by the
participating lecturers discussed the effect of the reorganisation on their
courses in special bibliography. a conclusion was reached that bibliographic
training will benefit from the planned changes and greater coordination of
general and special bibliography courses will have a positive effect on the
education of future bibliographers.

the term 'documentation' was 1st used by paul otlet of the institut
international de bibliographie in 1905. otlet regarded 'bibliography' as too
restricted a term to cover his activities. with the increasing use of
automated systems in libraries in the 1960s use of the term 'documentation'
has become more frequently applied to certain tasks in all types of libraries.
it is therefore unrealistic to consider librarianship and documentation as
separate disciplines. at the frederik muller school of librarianship in
amsterdam, documentation is taught as an integral part of the course for
assistant librarians. the subject occupies 20% of the syllabus and includes
subject indexing, information retrieval and abstracting techniques.

these courses would serve the needs of those interested in science/technology
libraries. the role of field work was also investigated. statistics are

in the last decade a new industry has emerged from the conjunction of data
bases, computers, telecommunications and on-line information retrieval. the
growth of this industry is reviewed showing how the initial application of
computers for production purposes produced new forms of information which
allowed the development of computerised retrieval. the various trends in the
data base field are identified and the results of an economic modelling study
are used to project future cost levels for searching data bases on-line. this
generates the need for increased training with data bases if industry is to
get maximum return from their use.

proficiency in searching 2 commercial systems (dialog and orbit) is the
objective of the 15 week course taught to graduate students in the school of
library and information science (slis) at pittsburgh university. software was
developed to replicate the language, formats and search capabilities of
dialog, orbit and brs. 60 students are taught each term; the course is offered
3 times annually. the students attend a lecture and a 2 hour supervised
laboratory session each week. the lectures are structured to give the students
an overview of various aspects of the computer-based information profession.
the laboratory sessions are of prime importance because throughout the course
emphasis is placed on learning the systems by being on-line. each student has
the use of a terminal during the laboratory session; and consequently is
on-line a minimum of 30 hours per term.

as a result of a reduction in the acquisition budget the danish veterinary and
agricultural library carried out an analysis of the present use of the
library. this was done to determine which parts of the collection could be cut
down without causing too much inconvenience to the suers. results showed that
appproximately 85% of requests for journals were covered by approximately 7%
of the current serials. approximately 30% of requests were for books. it was
concluded that an efficient back-up service for an on-line documentation
service could be provided by the library collection, the danish interlending
library structure and scandinavian co-operation agreements. this back-up
service is provided free of charge in exchange agreements. it was decided that
a joint scandinavian union catalogue of foreign serials based on the isds file
will be a valuable tool in the scan dinavian interlending systems.

the nederlands letterkundig museum en documentatiecentrum was founded in the

archivist of the hague, dr. w. moll, who deposited on permanent loan his
private collection of 360 boxes of material relating to about 1,500 dutch
authors. the collection now contains manuscripts, corrected proofs,
publishers' contracts, book illustrations, portraits and gramophone and
tape-recordings relating to dutch authors of the post-1750 period. the museum
is financed partly by the dutch government and partly by the city council and
has an annual purchase grant of approximately *64,000. in 1982 the museum will
be rehoused in the new royal library buildings at present nearing completion

when interviewed about achievements, priorities and problems of the cyril and
methodius national library in sofia, its director emphasises the importance of
information obtained through books, especially in the field of science and
technology, for the country's progress. although the information needs of a
small country like bulgaria are almost the same as those of the large country,
the former must be much more selective and carefully budgeted because of its
limited financial resources in general, and particularly in foreign
currencies. the national library's book collection is in fact, open to the
whole country by means of interlending. it has the main responsibility for
publishing the bulgarian national bibliography, computerisation of which has
gradually been introduced. extension of the present building, construction of
a depository library together with overall new investment will allow the
library to meet the incr easing demands on its services and help to maintain
standards.

traces the development of kfar gil'adi's library, on the assumption that
development was similar in other veteran kibbutzim. it is based mostly on oral
and written documentation-a lengthy interview with haim yisraeli, founder of
the library, minutes of kibbutz general meetings and written reports by
librarians. when yisraeli arrived in kfar gil'adi in 1934 he found about 250
books. together with his wife he voluntarily organised the collection and
enhanced it so that in 1938 it contained 10,000 volumes and became an
important institution in the cultural life of the kibbutz members. today the
library is no longer a cultural centre and the collection does not meet the
needs of the members. discusses ways in which the library could once more
become an important centre for the community.

the basic concept of the public library's tasks and duties in west germany
must be changed; outdated standards are a hindrance. the concept should demand
a fundamental unity of purpose agreed between local councillors and
administration and provide tasks for the library without pedantic emphasis on
theoretical niceties. the use of electronic data processing can assist in
explaining the purposes and functions of librarianship to the administration.
libraries must express the need for administrative reform through their staff
associations. current plans for library development should be reassessed.
federal ministries and advisory centres should be more closely involved with
libraries and more use should be made of mass media publicity. surveys should
be carried out on library use and large libraries should assist in the
financing of library research.

a talk given to the 14th nordic library meeting on the theme' part-time
libraries today and tomorrow. with a definition of part-time libraries as
those open only a few hours a week, iceland has only 15 full-time libraries
out of 250; 25 of 40 central libraries are part-time. with 60% of the
population living in the reykjavik region and the rest scattered in small
local authorities, it is not economically possible to have a library service
which fulfils ifla norms. the library act of 1976 made local authorities
financially responsible for libraries. many, therefore, combined school and
public libraries, as education receives state support. most libraries charge
fees for borrowing and most librarians are unqualified. the solution lies in
reducing the number of central libraries to 8; these should be run by the
state and have mobile libraries. local libraries should also be fewer.
training for part-time librarians with proper salary condi tions should be
initiated.

following lenin's exhortation that every citizen should have a library within
1.5-2 km from his place of residence, library services in 3 rural districts in
the mountainous part of the vraca region are reviewed. there are about 36
localities and villages there, but only 3 of them have more than 2,500
inhabitants. in spite of good public transport, provision must be made for
people working in remote mines and on sheep farms. book collections in local
public libraries range from 3,000-6,000 volumes. at present annual
acquisitions are on average 4.5 volumes per capita, against only 0.49 volume
in 1954. the target is 6.5 volumes per capita. among other problems discussed
are the assistance of the central regional library in vraca, centralisation of
acquisition and cataloguing, discarding of obsolete literature and the most
efficient use of financial allowances.

on closer examination, which reveals gross overcrowding in staff working
areas. the present building was erected in 1928 and additions were soon
necessary. the children's section, the catalogue department and the stacks are
placed elsewhere with ensuing transport problems. several plans for a new
library have been stopped by government cuts, despite local political
goodwill. however, gentofte library service as a whole is well provided, with
5 branch libraries, art library, spoken newspaper, domiciliary lending
service, hospital service, central guest workers' collection, and arrangements
for adults and children. the cuts have come at a time of increasing loans, but
still leave the library above average in materials and staff. describes the 2
year experiment which began at gentofte on 1 mar 81 with on-line se arching
using the dialog and euronet data bases. the library receives about 2,000
subject enquiries from other libraries in the county; only those which are

content with a 1,260 sq.m. extension in 1978 and acquisition of other
buildings to house the local history collection and children's activities, now
in the main library. would like more branch libraries in the suburbs, but

periphery. welcomes the use of the children's library as a child minding
service and leisure centre and approves of non-book material such as music and
posters. interviews the driver and mobile librarian. children constitute 75%
of mobile library users, with old people next in importance. a close
relationship to the readers has developed and readers are well satisfied with
the selection of books. interviews the chief librarian, povl skov, who hopes
to ope n 4 new branches during the 80s. the cuts have hitherto affected

a portrait of vissenbjerg library service, funen, denmark which has recently

when the library, formerly housed in a school, bought space in a shopping
centre where many shops had had to close. commercial advertising methods were
used to attract readers. the library is now open 20 hours a week and staff has
expanded. the development has been helped by the 2.4 million kr. grant from
the library inspectorate, which also partly covers running costs during the
1st 3 years. in an interview with the librarian, ole hansen, the problems of a
rapidly growing readership were discussed. he is hopeful that acquisitions

be made in the budgets for materials and staff, and no new activities, apart
from a spoken newspaper, are planned. in an interview, the chief librarian
regrets the cuts in materials amounting to 12% and blames the failure of adult
loans to increase dramatically after the expansion on the lack of popular
titles. the very large open plan adult library means long distances for
librarians and some confusion among readers. the lack of a concert hall and
meeting rooms is felt. to meet this need, hire of a hall in hotel prindsen is
planned. includes an architectural evaluation of the building and its

their library budgets amounted to more than 3 million dm. loans have risen
steadily since 1974 owing to larger book stocks, longer opening hours, more
instruction for students in the use of subject literature and the development
of interlibrary loan schemes. in contrast with the universities, the majority
of demands for external material came from students, especially examination
candidates, rather than from teachers. the ordering of monographs is

information is an essential part of any corporation's resources. only
recently, however, has emphasis been placed on the integration of various
kinds of information services offered in the corporate environment. a trend
has emerged to view the variety of information processing technologies from a
general systems perspective, termed 'information resource management' (irm). a
major concern of top management is to educate users in information as a
corporate resource.

the christelijk lektuur centrum was founded in the netherlands in 1968 as
successor to the bond van christelijke openbare leeszalen en bibliotheken
(association of christian public reading rooms and libraries). the aim of the
centre was to promote the formation of a network of protestant-oriented public
libraries throughout the country. however, at the time of the centre's
foundation a number of librarians had proposed that a single national
organisation free from religious bias be created to supervise library affairs
in the netherlands. as a result of the proposals the nederlands bibliotheek en
lectuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature) was formed in
1972. the clc was absorbed into the new organisation as a separate sub-group
and through the nblc has been able to promote the position of the protestant
church in library affairs.

since 1970 espoo public libraries have had a housebound service. 52 people are
served now and they borrowed 3,293 books in 1980. in 1981 the library
organised an open day for the housebound customers. during the year of the
disadvantaged, an additional sum of 40,000 finnish marks were granted to espoo
public libraries for acquiring aids for the disadvantaged. a working group
dealing with the area has contacted organisations working for the
disadvantaged for advice and information. the working group recommended that
libraries should try to buy the following' text tv's, listening aids for
talking books, hearing aids, magnifying glasses, magnifying cold air lamps,
wheelchairs, and walking aids.

discusses the efforts of librarians toward creating an awareness of, and
initiating a response to, the library needs of the print-handicapped. these
efforts have been confined to a relatively small group of librarians, who
through individual and committee endeavours have managed to arouse the
conscience of the profession and force it into meaningful action. the
international year of the disabled has emphasised the need for people to
firstly understand and secondly cater for the needs of handicapped people.

bonn public library service for senior citizens and the housebound was created
15 years ago. it is organised by the librarian of a branch library
specialising in large print material and programmes of activities for the
elderly. the librarian visits all prospective readers to find out their
requirements; close personal contact between staff and readers is essential.
each of the 180 readers is visited once in every 4 weeks, when books are
issued, renewed or returned within a specially simplified system. the branch
library supplies about 80% of the stock and publishes an annual list of large
print books held. the main problem for these readers is poor sight so large
print books are essential; books should also not be heavy since some readers
have difficulty holding them.

describes aids available for those with handicaps affecting their ability to
read. for some visually disabled, enlargement of the text by means of optical
instruments is enough. a correctly adjusted stand and lighting are important.
for the more severely visually handicapped, sight amplifiers, consisting of a
video camera and tv receiver, are available. various tape recorders aid the
blind. page turning devices have been developed for the mobility handicapped.
mentions a new aid for the deaf' ir-equipment, using infra-red light,
consisting of a microphone, a transmitter and a listening device (stetoclip).
videofilms with sign language are available through the social security. a
text telephone by means of which incoming calls appear as text is being
developed. libraries should be designed with the handicapped in mind, with
reading corners and study carrels equipped with aids.

following the publication of the report of the committee on books for the
mentally handicapped in apr 80 in the netherlands the nederlands bibliotheek
en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature) appointed a
staff-member responsible for the provision of books for the handicapped. at
the same time the nblc set up a working party to create contacts with
publishers, authors and illustrators, to advise on library work with the
mentally handicapped and to review the suitability of new books for this
group. as a result of the working party's efforts some libraries have set
aside special opening times for the mentally handicapped and library work with
the mentally handicapped is now taught as part of the course at several dutch
library schools.

the resources centres are for schools. the centre, opened in aug 80, employs a
children's librarian with experience of audio-visual materials and an
instructor. the material consists of 50 subject sets containing educational
toys, films, slides, and books. film projectors, cameras, episcopes and other
visual equipment are also lent. offset printing is available for use by the
institutions. the centre arranges workshops involving children and instructors
in producing films, and theatrical and film shows. urges libraries to

with problems of insufficient qualified staff, outdated and inadequate stocks,
shortage of equipment and the need to integrate the library into the school
curriculum. seminars were arranged to provide opportunities for discussion and
to help library staff to realise the school library's educational potential. a
report was written for the deutsche gesellschaft fur technische zusammenarbeit

hinter burg primary school has a library with 5,000 books and also records,
slides, cassettes and educational films. there is no qualified librarian, but
the teachers run the library with reasonable success. more money is needed for
stocks, for expansion and because books wear out quickly. the children are too
young to study independently there but they are actively encouraged to use
books. all classes except the lowest have regular weekly instruction in the
library. there is active cooperation with the local public library; the
librarian advises on purchases and arranges music and story-telling sessions
for the children. good contacts with parents and the local authority have also
proved helpful.

lecture given at the joint meeting of the study groups on university libraries
and large municipal libraries in essen, june 81. university students turn 1st
to the university library for the books they need but they also form a large
reader group in the public library of a university town. recent surveys made
in cologne and bochum reveal that the public library has a double function for
students, covering both general and specialised literature demands. the
students show great interest in social sciences and mathematics and their
interest in science and technology equals that of the rest of the general
public. they borrow less fiction than other readers, although they do usually
demand works of high literary quality and they are attracted by branch library
stocks as well as by those in central libraries.

there are over 34,000 students at bonn university, 60% of whom live in the

students from cologne and aachen universities also make use of bonn's library
services. if a student cannot find the required material in the university
library he turns to the public library for help. in the public library he
finds the advantages of long opening hours and of all media on open access. in
1980 15.73% of all loans in bonn public libraries were made to university
students; they used mainly academic material, especially sociology. the state
provides 13.1% of total library funds for specialised material.

on mondays, wednesdays, fridays and saturdays as a sample. results of the
survey have been presented with tables and charts. the survey indicates that
the library is functioning effectively, and the students are the largest
single group of users. however, there is strong discontent among all
categories of borrowers about the modern fiction collection. it has been

contribution to an issue devoted to educational broadcasting and libraries.
describes the links between renfrew district libraries and the bbc adult
literacy project. in 1975, the scottish adult literacy agency awarded the
libraries a *6500 grant to provide adult literacy materials, and bbc promotion
materials were used to extend the library's services. the bbc showed great
enthusiasm for the project and selected paisley as a venue for the roadshow
programme-a successful venture, although it oversimplified the services and
information provided by the libraries. libraries must respond to the interest
generated by the media, by providing resources, study facilities, and
professional skills required of librarians by individuals in an open learning
situation.

ontribution to an issue devoted to information seeking patterns of selected
professionals. summarises the interview findings of the 5 papers in this
special section. each individual has his special information needs and each
works in a field in which current information is both essential and often hard
to locate. co-workers are the most often consulted information sources, and
libraries were rarely if ever used for on the job needs-perhaps there is
little or no role for the library in this sphere for many workers. library
staff, too, consult co-workers when planning the library's reference
activities. potential users know what they need. librarians need to know the
extent to which they can fill those needs.

attempted solutions, such as initiation of attractive development programmes

describes roskilde university library's videotape collection. some recordings
were made from the start of the library in 1971, but they were usually
deleted. grants for modern video-cassette recorders in 1973 and the new
copyright act of 1977 making it legal to record radio and tv programmes for
educational use enabled the library to organise recording and use in a system
parallel to that for books. discusses the legal interpretation of who may
record, what may be recorded, responsibility for possible compensation, free
right to lend, duty to delete. argues that now that the legal question is
cleared up, public and research libraries should organise a system for
acquisition, registration, cataloguing and lending of recordings similar to
that for books. describes roskilde's solution. orders for recording of danish
and swedish tv programmes are received from staff and students and some
recording is done on the library's own initiative. after  recording,
registration is done on the basis of the programme title. subject entries are
made not according to udc, but to the library's own estimate of users' needs.

the central focus of this research was to analyse the impact of ideas
originating from within librarianship and information retrieval and those from
other disciplines. 12 most cited journals in librarianship and information
retrieval (source specialties) were chosen for citation analysis. from these
journals, 40 articles were randomly selected from the last complete year and
their references recorded, resulting in 1,159 citations. the analysis
consisted of measurements of self-citation, cross-fertilisation (proportion of
citations made by one to the other source specialty), and openness (the degree
to which a specialty is open to the ideas of other disciplines). report not

describes a visit by danish library school students to amsterdam. the group
saw the department of social information at amsterdam university library. the
department began in 1969 with the gift of the 'provo' movement's archives; it
now serves as an archives and documentation centre for materials of social
movements from the whole world. the materials range from books and records to
badges and t-shirts. such unusual materials demand untraditional methods of
acquisition, registration and retrieval; none of the staff was qualified in
librarianship. describes an alternative advice centre or 'legal shop'
(rechtswinkel), staffed by volunteer law students. a visit was paid to the
vrije archief, an archive which aids squatters' actions by making available
town planning information. library methods and cooperation with public
libraries were not regarded as of value to any of these centres, and
amsterdam's main public library, housed in a new building, b ut lacking
literature on community information, was not planning to cooperate with the
centres either.

from 1974-79, sections of political literature in 312 selected public, trade
union and school libraries in the ruse region were the subject of a
comprehensive investigation. 2,018 readers completed questionnaires and 191
were interviewed. the proportion of political literature in the total book
collections is on average 20%. the people who study political literature are
predominantly students or pupils. regrettably, only 31.7% of the readers used
libraries as a source of information for their necessary literature. mass
media and educational establishments play a much greater part in this respect.
the desirable turnover of political literature, the optimum number of copies,
and the discarding of obsolete books are also covered. on the whole, the
library service is performing a valuable role in political education, but even
so, there is little room for complacency.

is open all morning; pupils may come in freely to study, borrow books and
photocopies and examine specimens. they can make coffee there and chat to
their friends. although the pupils themselves are responsible for issues, very
few books have been lost. there are about 500 books, including reference books
and textbooks, frequently with multiple copies. in 1979-80, 150 senior pupils

argues that libraries have an important role to play in making the public
familiar with art. the 1964 danish library act made it possible to develop art
departments and several larger libraries took advantage of this, lending
mostly prints, posters and slides. this development has now stagnated owing to
various misconceptions. thus art need not be placed in special buildings only
visited by highly motivated people. a library should begin by lending posters,
which are easy to handle, and then proceed to prints. art need not be
expensive, a poster costing no more than a book, and large collections are not
necessary. whereas acquisition of posters is simple, prints and slides demand
more attention as central aids to selection of material are lacking.
exhibitions are important for widening people's conception of art. regrets
that the new danish library bill omits any mention of art.

the norwegian government envisages cultural committees as administering
libraries. individual library committees may survive, but as exceptions and in
conflict with official policy. the library sub-committee is unsatisfactory. a
ministry of church and education document (1979) outlines division of
responsibility between librarian and cultural administration. librarians must
insist on several professional demands. if these stipulations are upheld, and
guidelines drawn up with the support of library organisations, libraries may

present-day libraries and librarians face serious problems of economics,

most of the literature on the participation of public libraries in cooperative

have been' appropriate units of service; legal and political considerations;
stimulus of legislation; role of state library agencies; financial aspects;
human factors; and automation in networking. the literature reviewed was vast

social and political issues are key factors in developing cooperation among us
public libraries. experiences in public library cooperation have shown that
the acceptance of cooperation as an ideal, patron reaction and acceptance,
local pride and control, and the education and cooperation of the library
board, local government officials, and funding agencies are all important in
providing the best possible framework for cooperation. the commitment to and
understanding of the implications, changes, and modifications that cooperation
requires are also important. realisation that interpretation of what
cooperation means and that unequal contributions can be expected are necessary
steps in developing effective arrangements among public libraries.

especially over the past 30 years, us state library agencies have played a

activities among public libraries and between public libraries and other types
of libraries. these activities have been carried out in a great variety of
ways, with each state reacting to its own demographic, governmental, and
library realities. the federal library services and construction act has been
a major constructive force enabling state library agencies to be effective
leaders in cooperative and networking activities. state library agencies and
public libraries working together can continue to extend library services by
taking leadership in networking activities.

in the netherlands the public library authority of vlagtewedde, which with a
population of 16,500 inhabitants would have been compelled under the dutch
public library act to surrender its library service to the county council,
combined in 1978 with the nearby town of stadskanaal with a population of
34,000 to provide a joint library service. the combined library service now
has its main library at stadskanaal, 5 branch libraries and a mobile library
with a total collection of approximately 135,000 books and records. there are
16,600 registered borrowers and loans in 1980 totalled 750,000. library
services throughout the region have been improved by the creation of

the idea that increases in loans and stocks would bring about proportional
increases in finance, accommodation and staff has proved incorrect. statistics
on loans and stocks conceal weaknesses within a library and the unfulfilled
wishes of readers. there is no prospect at present of a library law and salary
negotiations have stopped. only 10% of the population use libraries' more
dedicated librarians are needed to develop social librarianship. freedom in
book selection is often threatened by the attitude of local officials and by
conditions on the book market. public libraries in germany have developed not
in a unified fashion but through a variety of historical causes. the best cure
of these problems would be an open and critical dialogue between librarians
and politicians.

discusses the library bill proposed by the danish christian peoples' party, a
minority party whose proposal has no chance of becoming law, but might yet
influence the ruling social democrats' proposal. the c.p.p. supports the
library commission's minority report and prefers that public libraries are
administered by the ministry of cultural affairs, while research, educational
and school libraries come under the ministry of education. but unlike the
minority report, it suggests that no non-book materials and cultural
activities should receive state support, and that it should be up to the
individual authority whether to charge for these or finance them out of the
local rates. exempted from this proposal should be lending of audio-visual
materials to the disabled. it supports the independence of the local authority
and its decisive influence on book selection. a block grant system of
financing would also aid local independence.

complains of the necessity for norwegian branch libraries to make separate
annual returns to satisfy the county library and the national library office.
1 coordinated report compiled by the central library should be sufficient.
separate returns can be positively misleading, since, for instance, books
transferred or circulating within a library system cannot be accurately
recorded. puts forward proposals to reduce the time spent on statistics; the
type required to justify the library's place in society were to be the
responsibility of a salaried committee of librarians. bookstock standards
would also be more viable if formulated for 1 authority, with the necessary
divisions into central library and branches. the status and function of the
county librarians' conference is queried, and the right of workers'
organisations to representation on the national library council is stressed.

the norwegian government report nou 1979 proposes that from 1981 state grants
towards county administration should cease, being replaced by additional tax
income. the intention is to simplify local government financial structure and
increase the counties' administrative responsibility and autonomy.
concentrating on technical details, the report ignores their effect on
professions and employment in the areas concerned. cultural work is defined as
a voluntary activity for counties, not requiring or meriting state support;
libraries are considered to be already under some degree of state supervision.
state support has been a stimulus to cultural life in rural areas, and its
removal would be a retrograde step. the proposals, if implemented without
further clarification of laws, regulations and areas of responsibility, could
lead to greatly varying standards of library service in individual counties,
also affecting schools and adult education. this would be di rectly counter to
the 'equality principle' in the current library act.

opportunities and problems confronting a public library in its pricing
decision are related to its pricing objectives. examines 6 objectives of price
and identifies the likely outcomes associated with each objective. these
objectives are market equity, social equity, maximum opportunity for
participation, maximising revenue, rationing, and commercial sector
encouragement. it is unlikely that a library will have one overall pricing
objective which is applicable to all the services it delivers. the price
ultimately adopted for any particular service will depend on which objectives
are uppermost in priority and will represent the best compromise among
conflicting objectives.

comments on the sections of a report by the research planning council' 2the
conditions for research in the public sector1 which deal with research
libraries. the conclusion is that the reduction of funds available for
acquisition of literature has led to severe problems for research. analysis of
the development in the 1970s shows increase in expenditure on staff and fall
in the real value of that for acquisitions, together with a doubling of
issues. the comemnts on libraries are scattered throughout the report, but can
be classed as those that mention' libraries without problems of acquisition,
or libraries where problems have not yet arisen, and libraries with
considerable problems. arts faculties have seen an increase in subjects and
foreign specialised literature coinciding with a decrease in book grants. in
the natural science faculties, institute libraries have been forced to acquire
books which would normally have been borrowed from a research library; gaps
are appearing in runs of periodicals, and reference works are in short supply.
service level has gone down as a result of undermanning of libraries. some
libraries, for example those of the agricultural and the commercial high
schools, stand out as particularly hard hit.

discusses cuts in the budgets for libraries in scotland in the light of the
government's cuts in public spending. argues that more efficient and slimmer

stresses the need for standards for services and means of measuring levels of
performance.

argues that if a large public library makes a practice of gathering
information on which to build budget requests, the time consuming data
gathering can be reduced in subsequent years by examining the overall
requested growth rate for the system and adjusting the figures where needed to
bring it in line with what is feasible. the adjusted figures can then be
returned to the requesting librarians for them to see what can be expected as
a request. demonstrates how, in times when funds are scarce, this practice
will act as an informational and decision-making tool and will serve to adjust
library needs to zero-base budgeting practices.

although librarians formerly adopted a defensive attitude when introducing
automated data processing, its use resulted in ergonomic improvements and more
interesting work for some staff. the use of automated data processing can,
however, cause stress and monotony, the control of work and human potential by
machines, increased isolation of individuals, the downgrading of some library
posts and the loss of a friendly atmosphere for readers. if the human touch is
to be retained in libraries, new standards are required. good communication
must be developed between staff members and between staff and readers. staff
work must be reorganised and the tendency to gigantism in the use of
automation avoided.

an introductory text on computers and data processing which provide a broad
overview of the field, with an emphasis on the needs and interests of the
library and information science community. many aspects of computing systems
are discussed ranging from hardware and software concepts to personnel and
documentation requirements. sections on storage considerations and programming
languages stress issues of particular importance in library computing systems.
at the same time, special attention has been given to those topics commonly
ignored in books dealing with library automation. for example, operating
systems and the internal methods of computer memory management are discussed.

research has concentrated on the technical aspects of library automation and
neglected the sociological aspects, so that opinion on the positive and
negative effects is sharply divided. the main purpose of automation is to
increase the effectiveness of library procedures; service changes are still
regarded as side-effects. automation's value must be judged in terms of the
average non-academic reader. the time saved for staff through automation of
routine procedures must be used for reader-oriented activities, for which
further staff training should be provided. the results of experiences in this
field from libraries abroad should be studied carefully.

comments on 2automated media control in the public library, 1a joint report by
the norwegian association of municipal library workers and the computer
committee. the working party on pilot projects does not delineate long-term
perspectives for development, making it difficult to see its proposals as part
of a whole. the swedish situation of 2 separate data systems for special and
public libraries, resulting in duplication of work and under-utilised
resources, must be avoided in norway; the report is criticised for not
considering computer development in public and special libraries together. it
also fails to specify the effects of computerisation on library staffs,
borrowers and finance. the committee regards issue control as the routine most
requiring computerisation, but many public libraries have other priorities,
such as overdue recall work. easily-amassed statistics must not be allowed to
build up extra work. several paragraphs from the report are selected for
detailed comment.

a norwegian county librarians' conference (sept 80) defined 2 main purposes of
automation' (1) library technology and administrative routines; (2) indexing,
storage and retrieval of information. norwegian public libraries should
probably begin with administrative routines and proceed gradually, while
discussing major long-term objectives, such as' an integrated system; a
decentralised system utilising central services; libraries not using computers
themselves, but largely dependent on computerised productions. the library
centre will eventually act as a data base for public library literature and a
centre for public library computer operations. local systems are viable only
for the largest libraries; small and medium-sized libraries must be linked to
a central authority, and hence to the resources of the large libraries. public
libraries must formulate their own policy for automation, evaluating systems
accordingly.

the norwegian computer committee will present a report on computerisation in

data technology has appeared at the right time to help librarians with the
greatly increased workload of recent years. retrospective literature searching
and current literature awareness, for instance, can benefit greatly from
automation. future developments are likely in the fields of social and
community information services, fuller indexing to aid identification in the
humanities, cataloguing of local collections, and indexing of audio-visual
material. all public libraries should set about informing staff and public on
the question of computerisation; the working party recently appointed should
intensify their discussions on the swedish bums system development and
automation in general; and contacts should be strengthened etween cultural and
library organisations with a view to discussing automation in swedish public
libraries.

the library computer system (lcs) network in illinois provides circulation
control for its member libraries. in addition, resource sharing has been
implemented by allowing each member library to search and borrow items from
the collections of the other members. the network is comprised of the 3
campuses of the university of illinois and 14 other academic libraries in the
state. the collective lcs data base contains over 10 million volumes. each lcs
member library can better serve its patrons because its access goes beyond its

future developments in library networks will include growth of computer-based
networks in number and variety of libraries, in use of various subsystems, and
in size of data bases used. services provided by on-line systems will expand
to include improved subject access, on-line catalogues, serials lists and
inventory control, acquisitions functions, interlibrary lending, circulation,
and reference services. additional services will include home delivery of
information, text transmission, home-computing support, library management
systems, and interface between bibliographic utilities. increasing interaction
is breaking open the artificial compartments in which libraries and librarians
have seen themselves. the demands placed on library personnel in network
development will need continued exercise of skill, knowledge, and integrity as

since the 2nd world war there has been a clear trend in the netherlands
towards professionalisation in the social and cultural services. however, in
the 1960s a reaction characterised by the growth of self-help organisations
took place against the post-war bureaucratic society. with the sudden change
in the economic climate and the rise in unemployment in the 1970s
professionals employed in the social and cultural services came to resent the
use of unpaid volunteers as a threat to their own positions. however, although
voluntary workers in libraries may lack professional expertise they are often
more socially-motivated than their professional counterparts. voluntary
workers in libraries should be employed in demanding and useful duties but not
at the expense of paid library staff.

gjovik public library and oppland county library, norway, opened in feb 80 in
a wing of a centrally sited council building, adjacent to the cultural centre.
its area is now 2084 sq.m. it is open-plan with shelves as room-dividers. the
ground floor houses inter-library loan and adult departments; the 1st floor
includes children's department, local collection, study rooms and a meeting
room. since staffing has not been augmented, opening hours have had to be
reduced; in spite of this, loans have increased.

town of 43,000 inhabitants. it is open 24 hours per week and its budget for
1981 totalled 70,000 dm. the ground floor contains the issue counter, adult
fiction and non-fiction, periodicals, media centre, reading-room, offices and
processing section. the 1st floor contains a spacious children's library; the
special teenage section provides books, a chess corner and facilities for

the report of the norwegian national library office's committee on library
premises (feb 80) was circulated to municipal and county libraries, library
associations and other interested bodies. there is general satisfaction with
its principles and recommendations. suggestions for improvement concerned more
concrete proposals for outreach and catalogue departments; larger minimum
areas for periodicals, reading places and youth libraries; the addition of
office accommodation, audio-visual equipment and separate study accommodation
as obligatory; the relationship between a 'recommended' level of provision and
the lower 'approved' level; recognition of the danger of closing small
branches without providing a satisfactory alternative such as mobile
libraries; a more positive attitude to 'combination libraries'; queries on the
standards for larger libraries; the status of the present temporary s
tandards; and the desirability of further proposals on standards for opening
hours and staffing.

kristiansand new central library, norway, opened sept 79, occupies 1000 sq.m.,
forming 1 side of the town's main square. its modern design blends externally
with the surrounding older buildings. internally the public departments form a
striking 4-storey vista of glass and steel. it also houses an art gallery,
cafe, lecture room, dance/drama practice room, and adult education study
department. 'noisy' activities, e.g. the loan counter and children's
department, are concentrated on the ground floor. the 1st-floor adult
department has capacity for 60,000 lending and 10,000 reference volumes. the

nesseby, in northern norway, is large in area (1,438 sq.kil.) but small in
population (1,120 inhabitants). after many years of inadequate library
accommodation, a new community centre including a library was opened in 1980,
so welcome that the increased financial burden is not resented. the library is
in the basement, but sloping ground allows ample window space. for the 1st
time there is a loan counter, a librarian's office, and adequate access to the
4,500 books. the addition of a proposed mobile library would ensure a good
library service to the area, though expansion will be necessary in time.

the staff of trondheim public library, norway, consider the latest
postponement (till after 1982) of the planned new library totally
irresponsible. having long tolerated unsatisfactory conditions in the
expectation of improvement, they now demand that the present library should be
brought up to current standards of health and work environment conditions,
though even this would not meet the needs of the local community. much of the
bookstock is housed elsewhere for lack of space, which together with staff
shortages makes for unsatisfactory public service. it is impossible to extend
services to the elderly, handicapped and other disadvantaged groups. only a
new library can bring trondheim into line with other norwegian city library
services.

town hall is planned next to the library. the building resembles a castle and
fits in with the other houses in the central square, all in mock medieval
style. the library (6000 sq. m.) consists of a main lending area surrounded by
a balcony containing the reading room, music library and offices. a large
meeting hall, carefully planned with regard to acoustics, is the centre of
film, music, theatrical and other activities. the aim has been to make the

lorenskog central library, norway, was established in school premises in 1967
as a combined public/school library. from the 1st it was too small and the
combination proved unsatisfactory. in 1971 a reorganisation plan for the
library service included a new central library. after several years of
postponements, worsening conditions and staff protests, the library rented 650
sq.m. in a new office block-more than double its existing accommodation,
though half the space proposed in 1971-and opened there in summer 80. loans
have risen by 85%. lack of staff necessitates a reduction of 9 hours per week
in opening times, and prevents any extension activities, but the staff

moss library, norway, was purpose-built in 1927, but until 1980 other local
government departments occupied all but the ground floor. in 1978 it became
possible to convert the whole building for library use. the library now
occupies 1292 sq.m. on 3 floors. the basement houses stacks, a study-room and
a story-hour room. lending departments occupy the ground floor, and reading
and periodicals rooms the 1st floor. a tower wing houses the librarian's
office, local collection and microfilm equipment. while extra space for
exhibitions, study places and a music department would be valuable, the
conversion is felt to be a success by both staff and public.

up the library's role in information for developing countries, which is not
merely a question of statistical economic and social documentation, but covers
all forms of literary and artistic expression. some swedish public libraries
have already provided facilities for discussing current topics in the field,
in cooperation with local study groups and sida, the swedish organisation for
international aid. a seminar for librarians was held in summer 77 on kenya and
tanzania, and a unesco seminar is producing a handbook of practical hints for

to ascertain the attitudes of reference librarians in academic libraries
towards reference service, an enquiry based on personal interviews and
questionnaires was carried out during part of 1979 and 80. the survey
population was selected from the 3 melbourne university libraries and 3 of the
larger colleges of advanced education libraries. interviews were designed to
provide information about attitudes to reference provision, and questionnaires
sought to measure respondents' attitudes towards specific reference services
as expressed by the acceptance or rejection of an opinion of such a service.
findings suggest that professional education and on the job training may be
both haphazard and ineffectual. it appears that a reassessment of the whole of

improve reciprocal information on possible subjects for cooperation and on the

summary of a brazilian dissertation presented for a higher degree in
information science, based chiefly on recent literature, brazilian and
foreign. the study covers the process of communication in science and
technology; user characteristics; the relationship between technological
innovation and information channels; and technology transfer and information
channels. this analysis of the process leads to the conclusion that in
research and development laboratories, informal channels of technical
communication are the most significant. proposes ways in which research and
development managers can maximise use of human resources through manipulation
of the communication channels within the organisation, through investigation
of the existing communication/information roles as information processing
systems. these roles constitute the true agents of technical communication ,
both within the organisation and between separate organisations. particular
reference is made to recent brazilian research.

library services available to staff in the uk national health service (n.h.s.)
and gives a preliminary report of a study of library usage and of attitudes
toward libraries among clinical and pre-clinical staff at oxford university.
libraries serving n.h.s. staff are numerous but small, most commonly being
staffed by a single librarian, and receive little publicity. in spite of their
small size a significant number have a 'special library' character. teaching
hospital libraries represent the intersection between the university and the
n.h.s. library systems and are the largest of the libraries serving n.h.s.
staff. data on usage and attitudes were collected by several different methods
in the expectation that this would give a richer picture than would be
provided by any one of conventional survey techniq ues. discusses the use of

indian agricultural universities have made a great contribution in the fields
of agricultural education and research and have justified the investment of
public funds on them as they have solved the problem of food and hunger to a
considerable extent by undertaking extensive research programmes and adopting
modern technology for increasing agricultural production. in order to sustain
their pace of research and development it is necessary to ensure central and
state support for sound development of agricultural university libraries.

the use and effect of foreign language literature on cereals research in
nigeria was determined by using a multi-method approach. english language and
indigenous african language literature was excluded. languages included were
french, german, spanish, russian, japanese and chinese. methods used in the
survey were a two-year analysis of the loans records of the national cereals
research institute library, questionnaires distributed to research scientists
and analyses of the foreign language references in recent publications and
theses of the scientists. results showed that scientists make little use of
foreign language literature because few of them are able to read these
languages. consequently scientists are missing important information and there
is duplication of research which use of foreign language literature could
minimise. results also showed that french, german, chinese and japanese are
important in cereals research.

the european interests and commencement of political autonomy, as well as a
certain and clearly defined dissociation of europe from the usa, comparable to
the objectively different interests of europe in the national security and
energy politics. the dissociation from the usa is proposed last but not least
in order that europe remains credible vis-a-vis the third world in the

paper presented at the 54th aslib annual conference, information '81'
forecasts and realities, oxford university, uk, 22-25 sept 81. the true cost
of obtaining and producing information is frequently hidden or distorted
through the existence of a system in which public and private sectors do not
always complement each other and may even be in open competition. looks at the
amount of money spent on information around the world and discusses the value
of information. to charge for information one way or another is unavoidable.
urges a reduced involvement of the uk government in information activities
peripheral to supporting the main functions of government and argues that with
the stimulation of innovation through competitive market forces, the quality
and relevance of information products would greatly increase.

examines the likely impact of new technology on librarians and information
scientists, and on data base producers, over the next 10 years. data base
producers will increasingly rely on home-based abstractors who receive, create
and send all their material by electronic means. the advantages of such
procedures for the data base producers are outlined. increasing use of
videodiscs for information storage and retrieval is envisaged. the impact of
new technology on librarians and information scientists is then examined. use
of videodiscs will mean a decline in the use of on-line information retrieval.
use of intelligent terminals will lead to greater use of these systems by
end-users. the intelligent terminals could be used to translate software
languages, to refine search strategies, to store and edit output from searches
and to advise users on the best data bases and best search strategy to use.
all these developments will be integrated into those leading to the 'office of
the future'. concludes that there will be a dramatic shakeout in
librarianship, but that information scientists face a great opportunity to
develop their skills by the opportunities afforded by the new technology. it
is recommended that schools of information science teach their students typing
skills. finally, some remarks about the advisability of offering sophisticated
information retrieval systems to less developed countries are made.

guidelines on computerisation policy for the norwegian association of
municipal library workers. data and telecommunication technology opens new
possibilities in dissemination of information, and public libraries must take
part. the principle of free access to information, knowledge and culture must
be upheld. state, local government and private information data-bases must be
accessible to the public. library resources must be considered as a whole, and
all public libraries governed by one directorate. the national bibliography
must be the starting-point for any system of public library data-bases. the
anonymity of the borrower should be safeguarded. trade unions say that any
loss of jobs through computerisation must be balanced by new jobs in other
areas, preferably releasing staff for improved reader service. existing
documents on the influence of automation must be implemented. there must be a
specific statement regarding employer/employee relations in  public libraries,
and working conditions must not deteriorate. computers must not be used to
oversee employees' work efficiency. staff must receive full instruction on the
technology and functions of the computer system.

the strategy of an approach to representing and searching the generic chemical
formulas (markush formulas) typical of chemical patents is outlined. the
methods under development involve the following stages' (1) the description of
generic chemical expressions by means of a formal language, gensal; an
approach to the generation and recognition of substituents or radicals defined
by generic nomenclatural expressions, via formal grammars; (3) methods for
automatic generation of screen characteristics, individually and within the
relational and logical frameworks defined by generic formulas; (4) search
techniques for identification of specific structures and substructures within
generic formulas based on these methods.

.I 3795
.W
a formal language, gensal, is described which is designed for the concise and
unambiguous representation of generic structures from chemical patents
('markush formulas') in a manner which is intelligible to a chemist, yet
sufficiently formalised for automatic analysis by a computer. gensal contains
a number of facilities for showing the alternatives possible in a generic
structure and any special restrictions placed on their variety. experience to
date suggests that gensal is capable of dealing with most of the types of
generic statement encountered in patents.

with idor-inhouse document online retrievalsystem-a self-supporting and
complete technology of document processing, is introduced. this new technology
offers the usual convenience of minicomputers with the speed of processing of
mainframes. this is accomplished by the implementation of a special
firmware-product, the axp-associate crosspoint processor. axp compares the
contents of the data bank at transfer-rates up to 1.2 megabytes per second
with 8,192 bytes of parallel query term memory. the normal effort of the

automated systems depends. information processing should be integrated into
the procedures for systems organisation and administration, and linked
directly to information dissemination services. the chief factor governing
quality of system input is information analysis, and in brazil this is almost

the methodological centre for research libraries and information and
documentation services in gotha held a workshop from 16-20 june 80 on the
problems of user training for students. university teachers are required to
instruct students in methods and techniques needed for using library and
information services. this instruction should form an integral part of their
studies to enable them to make full use of all available information in their
field while studying and to keep abreast of developments later on. the
workshop provided teachers with the opportunity to exchange ideas and
experiences on the subject, talks were given dealing with specific cases of
user training and 4 workgroups met to discuss ideas for further improvement.
teachers should attend further education seminars to keep themselves up to

goteborg, the library provides a basic introduction for 1st time users, a 14
hour course on library search techniques and an advanced course on information
retrieval. the emphasis should be on 'learning by doing'. the collection and

discusses the problem of classification of readers into groups, according to
their information needs, for the purpose of compilation of lists of
recommended readings. the objective of the study is to show the possibilities
of the application of criteria whose interaction defines a type of information
need of a group. criteria are based on a series of indicators able to express
essential and general characteristics of readers. concentrating on fine arts
bibliographies produces a model of the classification of readers into 4 basic,
expandable groups' students of technical colleges, secondary vocational
schools and working youth; students and intelligentsia; non-professional

the agricultural researches in the english-speaking countries of the caribbean
region with particular emphasis on the use of agrindex. the survey revealed
that agrindex is used by and known to only a small number of researchers and
possible reasons for this are discussed. from all indications it seems that
there is a need for an information service which would provide abstracts and
reviews of regional agricultural literature as well as information on research
in progress. two recommendations are made; one for the development of a user
education programme which would ensure wider use of agrindex and the second
for a sub-regional co-ordination centre to provide these services.

discusses automation in roskilde university library (roskilde
universitetsbibliotek (rub)). introduction of the samkat-project, a joint,
computerised cataloguing system for research libraries, opens the possibility
of coordinating accessions and cataloguing, but problems with job distribution
will be inevitable and should be faced. the standards specification group in
its preliminary reports on accession systems have sketched a system very like
the one used at rub. when the library was established in 1971 it adopted the
computerised cataloguing system of denmark's technical library. this was
developed into an issue and accession system, but not without teething
troubles. it has nevertheless brought advantages, such as transfer of work
from routine processes to services. the system's output includes' order forms
in fiche of books on order, budget control which gives accounts by subject,
reminder lists of books not yet delivered by the  bookseller, lists of new
acquisitions. as printing is excluded on economic grounds, problems arise with
the constant, tiring use of microfiche.

paper presented at the aslib conference information '81' forecasts and
realities, oxford university, uk, 22-25 sept 81. serials control is throught
to be the most difficult of library housekeeping processes to automate. no
automated serials control system has yet been demonstrated to be
cost-effective. minicomputer based systems show promise of more efficient
operation. studies at oxford university have shown the feasibility of
automated serials check-in being achieved faster than is possible manually.
further studies have demonstrated the constraints imposed for a comprehensive
system to be cost-effective. prediction of the arrival date for irregular
serials is a major problem. the difficulties (and expense) of updating files
in real-time represents another problem for which a tentative solution is
proposed. the need to improve the user interface is emphasised and this is one
of the most important matters for further study.

considers the variable factors affecting standards for public libraries, and
discusses the attempts made by the bourdillon report in 1962, and the latest
ifla standards for public libraries, to formulate standards for bookstock.
argues that, in order to maintain a good standard of public library service in
the uk, there should be a new and high level enquiry into how much of the
greatly increased output of british publishing should be purchased today.
points out that what needs to be known is whether public library bookfunds are
now cut to the point where the quantity of new books being added is not
matching those withdrawn through wear and tear, and that ideally there should
be an excess of additions.

bilateral agreements, either intergovernmental or between exchange partners
concerning the exchange of official publications have been signed between
denmark and 14 foreign states. the danish exchange institute (ide) is in
charge of these arrangements. ide receives the danish publications direct from
the issuing bodies and forwards them to the foreign partners. at present
approximately 300 danish government institutions publish the results of their
work. foreign official publications received in exchange are distributed to
danish research libraries according to their fields of interest, a high degree
of specialisation being typical of the danish research library system.

there is a great need for an efficient and planned national system of access
to documents. discusses reasons for inaction in this area and criteria for
national document supply systems. describes 4 basic models of national
interlending systems' model a is one of total centralisation on 1 source;
model b concentrates provision on 2 or 3 libraries; model c concentrates
supply on a greater number of libraries, specially designated and funded for
the purpose; and model d, which exists in most countries, is 1 of total
decentralisation. looks at combinations of these models, the economics of
centralisation, centralised 2versus1 cooperative solutions and effect of

results are given of a survey carried out at the end of 1980 from
questionnaires sent to over 260 libraries. reorganisation of the north rhine
westphalia libraries involved in the super-regional interlibrary loans has
been carried out; in 1980 these 181 libraries supplied over half a million
books to the scheme. detailed information is included on national and
international loans and on the contribution made by the top 12 libraries, with
similar information concerning libraries borrowing through the scheme. the
periodical specialisation scheme run by 7 university libraries shows an
increase in services of 31.3%. information is also included on loans within

the use of public library binding (plb), advocated for children's books in the
early 1950s by the ala association of library service to children (then
children's services division), has been a fiasco. plbs vary in quality and
some last no more than a few circulations. it is especially foolish for large
libraries to buy any plb they do not need because their 38-40% trade discounts
make them bear the brunt of the inequitable plb net pricing systems. reviews
the problems caused by plb and contends that binding standards must be set
which cater for books less durable than lbi class 'a' standards and which

comments on the report of the national association of local authorities
(kommunernes landsforening (kl)) on the trial run of the public libraries'
automation system, faust, in olstykke library. gives the reasons for the
failure of faust as lack of perceived economic returns, opposition of the
librarians' union on the grounds of staff reductions, and size of initial
investments. the few librarians who pointed to improved service and long-term
economic benefits were overruled. biblioteksdata, which replaced faust in
1978, is more decentralised, with services tailor-made to individual
libraries' needs. argues that kl in its report dismisses the value of the
trial run and the staff's views of the experiment, which stress the
labour-saving effects of the automated issue control system. calls for central
registration of public libraries' stock in the common data base by the library
centre; then the individual library can begin registration of its own sto ck
and start using automated issue control with ensuing improvements in service
and labour economies.

problems in cataloguing and classifying theatre resources have significantly
contributed to the difficulties of theatre librarianship. the unsuitability of
major existing classification systems for use with theatre collections has
prompted librarians to seek alternatives, such as modifications and original
classifications. additionally, collections of non-book, or 'fugitive',
theatrical memorabilia are practically impossible to catalogue properly, given
the desperate financial situation facing many theatre collections. us survey
data on current practices indicate a strong trend toward standardisation of
procedures in classifying, yet a continuing diversity in cataloguing methods.
the coming of computer technology, along with increased awareness among
theatre librarians and input from concerned professional organisations, may
help alleviate some of these problems in the future.

in 1977 the pica (project for integrated catalogue automation) system became
operational in the netherlands. the pica network is the result of an agreement
concluded by the dutch government and universities in 1969. in addition a
number of other libraries, including leeuwaarden county library and the public
libraries of amsterdam and the hague are members of the network as 'customer'
libraries. overall supervision of the network is maintained by the pica bureau
located in the royal library. member libraries contribute catalogue records
via on-line visual display terminals direct to the central data base, from
which output may be obtained in the form of catalogue cards, paper printout or
microfiche. in 1982 the central data base will be adapted for use in
acquisition and loans control systems and in 1983 will be used for the
national interlibrary-lending network.

with reference to the relevant passages in aacr2 and isbd(g), notes the
elimination of the term 'subtitle' and the resultant difficulties. subtitles
will not disappear just because they are no longer called by that name. the
term must be reinstated in the official vocabulary of cataloguing and
operational definitions of 'title proper' and 'subtitle' formulated. such
action would go a long way towards uniform implementation of the rules,
leaving much less to the individual interpretation of the catalogues and

originally presented at the 4th international congress on medical
librarianship held in belgrade, yugoslavia, 2-5 sept 80. on-line literature
retrieval services currently available in japan are jois, tool-ir, ideas/77,
dialog, and orbit. general limitations associated with literature retrieval
services are: (1) data bases do not cover certain primary sources; (2)
secondary sources in the medical field such as igaku chuo zasshi and berichite
& zentralblatter are not available on-line; (3) indexing of information is not
exclusive, even if the primary source is covered by the data base. in order to
compensate for these problems, the nippon medical school library produces
index cards for special feature articles which are not easily retrieved,
syndromes of diseases, and meetings held by societies without official

the draft version of rak-ob. large public libraries tend to accept this if
they have not already opted for the academic library version but smaller
public libraries stocking mainly german language material are critical of the
draft. it was decided, therefore, that alternatives for small public libraries
be included in rak-ob with reference to personal names, corporate bodies, unit
subject headings, parallel headings, subordinate entries, entries for
musicalia and sound recordings for children. rak-ob and rak-wb must not differ

efforts made since the mid 19th century to produce alphabetical union
catalogues of all books within a university have been hampered by the
difficulty of access to some institute library stocks, by inaccurate
cataloguing in institute libraries and by the questionable value of a central
catalogue within purchasing policy. since 1970, however, professional opinion
has been increasingly in favour of union catalogues in universities; work in
this field at various universities is described and evaluated through analysis
of interlibrary loan figures. these catalogues should be produced only when
certain conditions prevail, e.g. when institute stock subject coverage is much
wider than that of the central library, when access to the union catalogue is
easy and when the catalogue can be produced without detriment to other work.

a symmetry group called the conformation symmetry group (cfsg) which provides
a method of uniquely specifying molecular conformation based on an appropriate
discrete bond property (such as rotameric state) is formulated. the method is
applicable to entire chemical structures as well as substructures. the cfsg
can be used to build a simple 'acyclic' conformation generator and leads to a
solution for a heretofore unsolved problem in conformation enumeration.

on the basis of the focal numbering of each benzenoid ring in the graphite
lattice, any polyhex (cata-, peri, and corona-fused polycyclic benzenoid
system) can be coded by making use of (1) the dualist graph of the polyhex and
(2) the recent generalisation of the topological centre concept. the numerical
code can be used for nomenclature purposes, and the present approach can be
easily generalised to condensed nonbenzenoid systems as will be shown in
future publications.

it was confidently expected by system designers that on-line bibliographic
search systems, with their ability to provide direct and immediate access to
information, would be interrogated by the end user. a review of the literature
reveals however, that contrary to such expectations, most searches are still
being performed by trained intermediaries. clearly, the attempt to convert
former off-line batch systems used by either computer scientists or
information specialists, into on-line interactive systems for use by all has
not worked, despite the claims of their designers to having developed 'user
friendly' systems.

the increasing number of data bases and data bank suppliers has brought with
it the problem that different host computers must normally be accessed using
different command languages. many of these languages bear relationships to one
another, by virtue of common ancestry, common design philosophy, etc. even so,
the same language can be implemented differently by 2 suppliers. different
implementations and/or languages must be considered by on-line users before
contracting with a host. the consequences of learning a new command set,
buying additional manuals, and attending extra courses are all economic ones,
and are particularly relevant when a data base is offered by several
suppliers.

there are many reasons why the growth and spread in the use of on-line
information retrieval systems has been less dramatic than might have been
expected. one of the obstacles facing the user is the need to master many
diverse user interfaces. several solutions are offered, yet, the only one
which is really open at present is to decline to use all but 1 or 2 familiar
systems, accepting that some potentially valuable information will be missed.
the main alternatives seem to be the adoption of standards by system operators
or the use of translating software somewhere between the user and the
retrieval systems. with the advent of the microprocessor and the intelligent
terminal, this latter alternative becomes more attractive and it may appear,
at 1st sight, that the need for standards for command languages is therefore
lessened, or even disappears totally. however, careful consideration of the
possibilities offered leads to the conclusion that the adopti on of standards
will be more rather than less important if much of the potential is to be
realised.

examines on-line systems in english public libraries on the basis of visits in
connection with a conference on on-line information in public libraries held
in sept 81. luton central library has found that availability of on-line
search methods has increased use of their reference service by businessmen and
hospital medical staff in particular. hertfordshire county library installed a
terminal in 1975 and carried out on-line searches; as a result it was able to
cancel subscriptions to some reference works. in 1981 it acquired an scl
microcomputer for accession and issue control. birmingham central library has
a terminal in the technical reference room, with access by all departments,
but not the public. it regards the on-line service only as an additional
reference tool. none of the libraries undertook computer searches of their own
stock, but only in international data bases. librarians found that search
effic iency increased if users were interviewed first, but not present during
the actual search, and that those carrying out the search should be
experienced reference librarians specialising in a particular base. raises the
question of the effect on publication of reference works in paper editions of
the growth of on-line search facilities. (for part 1 2see bibliotek 70 1(17)

15 centres in the uk. the 1st installation of the new system immediately
demonstrated its potential for fast, accurate input at low cost. specially
designed for processing structured alphanumeric data, formatext-11 has
facilities for forms design, authority file definition and maintenance,
character set definition, source text entry, proof printing, releasing and
data communications. the ease with which the 1st 3 of these facilities can be
modified makes formatext-11 a uniquely flexible tool for producers of
bibliographic data bases, directories, encyclopaedias and dictionaries.

analyses the drawbacks of the traditional composition of a thematic inquiry in
an automatic information retrieval system that does not provide for an
adequate reflection of the specialist's information needs in an inquiry. shows
that the relevant documents retrieved by the system in response to a
traditionally-composed inquiry are not necessarily pertinent, since the
criteria employed by the user when analysing and evaluating documents are not
included in the inquiry text as retrieval characteristics. introduces the
concepts of objective and subjective information needs and 'retrieval
information need'. considers the problem of understanding the composition of
pertinence criteria and their formulation in an inquiry. proposes the
classification of pertinence criteria.

whatever the outcome of legislative proposals before the 96th congress, the
structure of the telecommunications industry is being debated in numerous
regulatory proceedings, court cases, etc. central to these discussions are
'proper costs' and their relationships not only to prices but also to other
benefits or burdens. costs have been allocated in the traditional
telecommunications industry mainly by a 2-stage process. 1st, explicit
jurisdictional separations have allocated costs hence revenue requirements
among the federal and all the state jurisdictions. 2nd, pricing rather than
costing policy has determined the further incidence of benefits and burdens in
the general absence of explicit suballocations of costs within the pools of
costs assigned to the broad aggregates of interstate and state services.

research into reasons why certain sections of the population make little use
of public libraries will become increasingly important in the planning of
library policy. in the past too much research into library use has served only
to confirm what was already suspected, that public library users belong mainly
to the higher income and better educated sections of society. in the
netherlands the bureau voor de collectieve propaganda van het nederlandse boek
(office for the joint promotion of dutch books) has designated a 'book of the
month' as a special offer each month since 1970. a new organisation should be

chamber)-an institute responsible for the bibliographical registration (both
current and retrospective) of publications put out within the territory of
individual republics. the function of the coordinator of bibliographical work

that the problem of professional copying of musical works especially has been
tackled; more severe punishment for infringements of copyright is envisaged.
photocopying of printed matter by educational and public institutions is being
brought under control with better systems of reporting use. it is up to the
organisations representing the copyright holders to produce a system of
collective administration for dealing with users. abolition of copyright,
argued by those who want a free market in cultural products, would lead to the
death of culture. licence agreements are much to be preferred to compulsory
licences. but such a system must be combined with forms of state support for
the producers.

a systematic chemical name is one which portrays the essential structural
features of a chemical compound by some general pattern. for most purposes it
is unnecessary to write nomenclature rules in such detail as to provide a
single name for each compound. like all human activities nomenclature patterns
change with time. this is essential to meet new conditions, to secure greater
generality, or to obtain simpler names. while nomenclature specialists must be
attuned to the needs of nomenclature users, their suggested solutions to be
successful must be acceptable to the users. the presentation details with
particular reference to inorganic chemistry (1) the committee-commission
structure in this country and internationally, (2) significant accomplishments

information scientists to the thought and culture of ancient greece, but
sounds a warning to information scientists that some of the lessons learned
from the greeks are being blindly and unthinkingly misapplied today, to the
detriment of clear thinking about library problems. describes the ancient
greek theory of the sign expressing the relation between words, thoughts, and
things which is still influential in philosophy, linguistics, and psychology,
but is often inappropriately invoked in these disciplines and in library and
information science and the study of communication. the model is ambiguous,
and so an alternative, based on human linguistics, is proposed.

paper presented at library history seminar vi 'libraries & culture', austin,
texas, 19-22 mar 80. with growth comes complexity; and librarianship becomes
increasingly complex as it grows. a 2-fold approach to the understanding of
librarianship is suggested. firstly, librarianship should be viewed as a
general discipline and its characteristics should be studied as a whole, and
secondly, basic components of librarianship should be identified, by reducing
the complexity of the field to its simplest parts-its 'roots'. proposes a
model of 'metalibrarianship' based on this analysis, and involving assumptions
about its nature in terms of the mechanism, expanded contextualism and
formism, and suggesting that the primary root metaphor of metalibrarianship is
the relationship between the generic book, its subject matter, and its reader.

provides a chronological analysis of the study of librarianship in western
countries as reflected in the writings of soviet librarians. contributions
from 1920s and 1930s reveal not only criticism of the western library theories
but also appreciation of practical achievements. inconsistency of theory
(non-political orientation of libraries) with practice (middle class bias of
public libraries) was 1 of the main areas of criticism in the 1940s and 1950s.
1960s brought wider interest in special librarianship and problems encountered
in various countries. the current interest is the influence of western
librarianship on developing countries.

a critical evaluation of almost 30 years of 2bibliotekar's 1history.
inadequate financial resources have meant that authors fees are not generous,
and the quality of the published material suffers. it is also impossible to
improve the journal's layout, although the printing facilities at the cyril

should improve 2bibliotekar's 1quality and image, e.g. articles should be
planned well in advance by the cyril and methodius national library and other
major libraries. freelance correspondents all over the country should report
regularly about libraries in their regions. other freelance collaborators,
with a good command of modern languages, should provide reviews of foreign
periodicals on librarianship and designate articles worthy of full translation
into bulgarian. a special commission should be appointed to specify
2bibliotekar's1 statute which would strengthen its position as the only

the advent of data processing and information science has improved the
standing of librarianship as a profession and at the same time created a
demand for better qualifications, especially graduate entry. library
associations have an important role to play in putting pressure on local and
central government to improve the status of their members. this status varies
considerably from 1 country to another, although the general trend is upwards,
and from 1 kind of library to another. in some universities, librarians enjoy
full academic status, but a librarian must be more than a pure academic and
must be proficient in the practical administrative skills as well.

archivists wishing to pursue the concept of archival theory must first define
that concept and then weigh their definition against the work done in the
field so far. one approach would be to consider theory as the development of
universal laws, and to frame hypotheses in universal form and test them
against the evidence. addresses the likely future trends in us archival theory
against this background, concluding that there is hope for the profession if'
(1) the profession itself realises that it is both a science and a craft; and
(2) certain archivists make the move from the workplace to the academy as a
permanent career commitment. there they must realign themselves with academic
historians and others to produce a body of basic principles, a system of
immutable laws-a litany of theory and dogma.

socialist library systems aim to improve the educational level of the people
in all subjects, to provide sound communist training and to support the
further growth of socialist society. the education and training of librarians
must, therefore, be in accordance with these objectives. the librarian has a
responsibility to society to provide for the growing demand for literature and
information, to further research study and to support socialist education.
whatever branch of library work the student will eventually be involved in,
training should not be restricted to learning facts and library methodology
techniques but should also provide a flexible training in the socio-economic
aspects of library work. a librarian should be able to relate his particular
social role in his branch of library work to the socialist library system as a
whole.

the intramural course of study at the humboldt university in berlin leading to
a degree in library science provides future librarians with scientifically
based knowledge and good practical career training. a student follows courses
in subjects related to library science, marxism and leninism, and foreign
languages, russian, english and french. several practical work periods spent
in different public and research libraries make up part of the course.
librarian students also attend courses in subjects such as information
science, technology and modern media to enable them to follow future
developments in these fields affecting the library system. the course of study
lasts 8 terms, the last of which is spent in a library doing practical work
and researching for a thesis for the final examination. the title awarded to
librarians on passing the finals is diplombibliothekar (diploma librarian).

in east germany and ussr; and the bibliography of bibliography. these 7 themes

bibliography of bibliography, which often accompanies other themes. the course
in bibliography is a balanced mixture of theory and practice. it is important
that students should be educated to the advanced level of bibliography as it
exists in east germany and ussr. the time allotted to the course is not
adequate and students have to study independen tly which requires a good

library classification represents the foundation of systematic catalogues and
plays an important part in subject cataloguing. its form relating to content
and ideology depends on the level of development of the sciences and society
which it reflects. it is necessary to study it from an historical point of
view. through studying the subjects library classification and subject
cataloguing students are enabled to understand the methodological basis of
library classification and to evaluate it from a marxist-leninist point of
view. this is also relevant in the case of terminology for a subject catalogue
or a thesaurus. students are informed about all aspects of subject cataloguing
and follow the development of library classification from the end of the 15th
century to the present situation in east germany. they are made aware of the

historical perspective on analogic recording of acoustical phenomena from
edison's phonograph to modern hi-fi equipment. only those sources which offer
a recording of real sound have the same historical status as written or
printed sources. as such, the education of music historians and music
librarians should include the scholarly study and evaluation of recordings, so

library science should ensure that graduate librarians receive appropriate
training to allow them to cope with the work demanded of them at university
libraries. this will include' all types of book processing; work with users;
publicising library stock, especially cultural heritage collections; activity
in halls of residence libraries; coordinating work between different sections
of the university library; library technology; storage and maintenance.

report of a lecture given to the annual meeting of denmark's school library
association, 1981 by peter seeberg. the historical background of school and
public libraries in denmark is reviewed and doubts are cast on the genuineness
of official danish liberalism in relation to the development of and attitude
to libraries. schools and libraries originated from 2 entirely different
concepts' in schools children had others to think for them; libraries in
denmark arose from the late 19th century idea of culture for all and access
for all to everything there was to know. by the 1930s libraries had become
instigators of culture, with lectures as well as books available, and were
regarded as progressive in all its meanings. this is still the aim of
libraries today, but schools and libraries have always belonged together and
integration of the 2 is perfectly reasonable.

statistics on public libraries in east germany for 1976-80 reveal increases in
stocks, loans and users. in 1980 stocks totalled over 36 million items, loans
over 79 million and readers over 3 million. development has been slightly
slower than during the previous 5 years, partly because a high standard had
already been reached and partly because more organisational improvements were
required. plans for stock expansion have gone ahead because the state
publishing industry's production figures have increased. the planned total
stock expansion figure has been exceeded and efforts were made to keep stocks
up to date. total library expenditure in 1980 was 111,642,600 m, reflecting

number of books per head of population. in spite of these encouraging
statistics, the state control committee made an investigation recently into
the structure, organisation and efficiency of library services in 7 regions.
the availability of public, school and trade union libraries varied greatly.
inhabitants on some of the new housing estates have been deprived up to now of
any kind of library services. there were cases of haphazard opening and/or
closing of libraries. there is still a lack of information and reference
services, shortages in consistent cataloguing and proper upkeep of rarities,
recovery of overdue books, as well as inadequate audio-visual and reprographic
equipment. better planning for acquisiti ons, and also more considerate
discarding of obsolete items are most desirable. the committee's findings will
be presented to local government and other relevant bodies whose members have
to take a much more active interest in libraries in their regions, in
particular in rural areas.

1 mobile and 10 branch libraries. the new library will have 1500 sq.m. with
room for expansion, making a music library possible eventually. interviews the
mayor and chairman of the union library, who is prepared to allocate more
money to the service if demand increases. the mobile library has been very
successful in areas too sparsely populated to sustain branches. party politics
is fortunately absent among politicians dealing with libraries. they must,
however, have the final responsibility in book selection, while interfering as
little as possible. interviews the chief librarian. since the union, space
problems have mounted, and with the new library, loans are expected to
increase without extra allocation for staff. would like to se e another mobile
library replace some of the branches which have few loans. the mobile library
has brought new readers to the main library. however, the use of 1 of the
branches visited was such that a mobile library could not replace it.

for society is likely to increase, thus distancing the handicapped further
from the normal population. the special problems of the deaf, the mentally
ill, the aphasics, the blind, and the mentally retarded were discussed.

with demands from external students. the college carried out a survey, sending
questionnaires to 40 colleges in australia; the results are outlined. major
conclusions were that services by college libraries for external students were
varied, and in an embryonic stage, and there was urgent need for the
development of standards for library services to external students. more
cooperation between the librarian and external studies department staff was
needed. the conclusions enabled the ciae to refine objectives and to expand
the concept of the external studies library service. note' this abstract is a
corrected version of an earlier abstract and replaces 80/4299.

examines the library service to denmark's 100,000 immigrants. the 'quest
worker collection' in gentofte library, set up in 1970, has not yet solved the
problem of selection or acquisition of suitable material. best results have
been achieved with activities for children. meetings between library staff and
immigrants could improve services. information to the danes about immigrants
is varied and should be acquired by libraries. but there is a lack of material
in danish on the immigrants' home background and cooperation is hampered by
lack of immigrant leaders. the library school has not yet taken the subject
up. 2 reports from the library inspectorate (1973, 1980) come up with
proposals, and an ethiopian born librarian, i. abdullahi, in his 'description
of immigrants and libraries in denmark' (1981), contributes to the debate. he
lists the information from libraries which immigrants need and suggests ways
of improving services, some of which need mo ney, others only improved
personal effort and reorganisation of existing work.

libraries in socialist societies are consciously oriented towards the user.
important objectives of library work concerning library use are' the
continuous development of cultural and educational needs; development of an
awareness of social needs; and planned stimulation of the need for new
literature and information. the subject group on library use supplies students
with the necessary knowledge and skills to use the socio-political aspect of
entire library activity and adapt it to meet the social needs of the user.
library use falls under 2 main headings' use in the library itself and
external use, the lending system. other important features of library use are'
library regulations forming part of the civil law; the lending system, how to
make it most effective for the user and user education courses which should be
organised by libraries to improve the users' knowledge of the library s ystem.

the hospital medical library at szolnok (hungary) supplies library services to
248 doctors, 30 pharmacists, and 21 paramedical workers. in 1980 there were
325 card holders, the number of library visits amounted to 2,350, loan data to
4,500 volumes. during 1971-80 the library performed 426 literature searches
including 7,680 bibliographic entries. from the total of 1,387 bibliographic
data in 1979, 947 original documents were requested, 51 of which were not
available. investigation of the citations in the communications by the

walter hofmann published as part 2 of a paper on libraries 2on the psychology
of the proletariat (zur psychologie das proletariats) 1in 1910. he carried out
a great deal of research into the types of literature working class people
read, what categories working class readers could be divided into and how to
influence and improve their reading habits. he also carried out an important
survey on women's reading. rudolf angermann continued and expanded hofmann's
work. they both considered the stimuli to read certain types of literature to
be of great importance and angermann formulated a list of different reading
stimuli. they were both of the opinion that the librarian's task was to act as
adviser and intermediary between the literature and the reader. their aim was
to offer good quality literature to large sections of the people. today
methods of reader research continue to be d eveloped in socialist countries
and aim to achieve an optimal relationship between the acquisition and use of
literature.

in the netherlands despite compulsory education for the whole population there
are now some 100,000 to 400,000 (semi-)illiterates. in dutch schools 2 methods
of learning to read and write have been used, the traditional method of
learning to recognise lists of simple but unrelated words and the functional
method which was related to the pupil's environment and experience. whichever
method is used, it is essential to develop the pupil's ability to read
fluently and to motivate him to continue reading after leaving school. the
dutch public library act of 1975 recognised the importance of library services
for young people in abolishing library membership charges up to the age of 18.
however, the act failed to recognise the need to provide special types of
reading materials for people with reading difficulties.

reports the speech by the danish library association's chairman, karl johan
mortensen, to the meeting of the kommunernes landsforening (national
association of local authorities), where the question had earlier been raised
of how culture could be disseminated to larger circles. it was argued that
expansion of library activities was not enough to reach those unfamiliar with
libraries. the institutional framework had prevented genuine decentralisation
and popularisation of culture. libraries with rigid management and demand for
qualified staff were preventing their use as local culture centres. solutions
involving greater coordination with other local activities were offered.
against this mortensen argues that the 1964 library act promoted
decentralisation and that libraries more than other institutions are reaching
the broad population. warns against reduction of library activities in order
to help the grass roots movements. local aut horities need the support of the
state for library services. the debate that followed and the reply from the
national association's chairman stressed that libraries were not under attack.

introductory speech to the study session of the working party for county
library systems, noordwijkerhout, 1 sept 81. in the netherlands, the rise in
living standards since world war ii has outstripped the increase in leisure
time. in addition the average citizen devotes a large proportion of his
increased purchasing power to acquiring private comforts. whereas before the
war most people visited the cinema or theatre for entertainment, and travelled
by bus or train, nowadays they watch television at home and travel by private
car. similarly research shows that the average citizen uses the library not as
a substitute for a private collection of books but to supplement his own
collection. as the economic recession deepens there is a real danger that the
government will turn public libraries into recreational centres and create new
libraries as information centres.

scholars such as cole, zoltowski, gaskell and levebre. the search for
bibliographical information is distinguished from true bibliographical

procedures of macrobibliographical analysis, and of the development of
microbibliographical analysis with the introduction of citation indexes. the
next advance envisaged is the construction of citation chains when a
humanities citation index becomes available, which may well have major

in the 1978/79 academic year students of the frederik muller school of
librarianship carried out a survey into censorship in public libraries in the
netherlands. 15 libraries, varying in size from small town to large city
libraries, were selected, 5 in areas with a strong protestant leaning, 5 in
roman catholic areas and 5 in areas with no strong religious convictions. the
results showed that the number of controversial books stocked by libraries was
in direct proportion to the size of the library. in addition, despite the
assurances of all librarians that no form of censorship was practised, fewer
books of a politically-controversial or pornographic nature were to be found
in libraries in religious areas. it is clear that censorship is still alive in
the netherlands in 1981 under the guise of 'rejection on ethical grounds'.

their founders' intention to preserve the present for the future. the

library fiction issues comprise 2.5% of total issues, classics amounting to 5%

feelings that children are too young to understand them or are not interested.
children should be taught how everything 'interconnects' in russian
literature, which asks the same eternal questions as 'moderns'. russian
classics ought to become indispensable to young people's lives. schools and

adopt a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach. discusses the
quantitative studies of information production published over the last 20
years, and proposes an alternative viewpoint based on baudrillard's
sociological analysis of consumption, emphasising the social implications of
consumer demands. if the sociological pressures behind user needs are
understood, the information specialist is then able to both monitor user
requirements and exercise some influence over the production of information
designed to meet social pressures rather than intellectual objectives.

an increasing number of people believe that the position of local authority
cultural services must be clarified in the 1980s. the library service is a
part of local culture that cannot be overlooked and so it is essential for
each library to cooperate with other libraries, cultural organisations and
local government administrators. a decision is needed as to whether local
authorities are not only entitled but also obliged to administer public
libraries. the concept of a national library law should be renounced in favour
of a concept whereby local authorities impose on themselves the obligation to
provide public libraries. local communities should draw up their own library
plans and provide the money; each state should then provide financial
assistance for library work outside these areas.

council, albeit with a different composition. it would have liked to see art
collections put on a par with music collections, and library provision for
intermediate education and outreach activities made obligatory. the library
centre, of whose board the association has a majority membership, is willing

report of discussion between friedrich andrae, klaus hohlfeld, ulrich thiem,

promote the use of books, a job which must be taken more seriously than ever
before. recent surveys have shown that about 40% of the population are library
users. where possible, economies should be made in working methods rather than
in services; this demands more centralisation. it is better to put books in
laundry baskets on window ledges and on pavements than to take them away from
the public completely or to make them available only for restricted periods.
libraries make a valuable contribution towards the mastery of life's problems,
an argument which politicians and administrators are beginning to appreciate.

discusses the cutbacks in services to children in the usa through public and
school libraries and problems of access to resources. turning points in public
library service to children seem to revolve around 3 factors' use of the
generalist approach in providing service; the changing status of the central
children's library; and developing school/public library cooperation.
children's librarians must exert pressure for examination of library school
curricula and recommended programmes that prepare children's library
specialists.

the german economy is adapting with difficulty to the recession, to the
detriment of public budgets. culture is important during economic crises,
therefore cultural bodies cannot renege on their social responsibilities.
thrift may not always be the most economic procedure. an analysis is made of
statistics on library expenditure by large and small local authorities in west
germany in 1975-79 to illustrate the importance of the relationship between
staffing costs and the total budget. a careful library policy must recognise
the possibilities and limitations of adapting to the financial situation in
the light of its social responsibilities. if rationalisation methods are
carried out efficiently, the library service can adapt in the right way.

because the staffing formula mandated by virginia's state council of higher

a talk given to the association of part-time librarians, group c of the danish
library association, at its 25 years' jubilee, oct 81, by a former chairman.
when the association was formed in 1956, as an association of parish
librarians, the position as part-time librarian was usually honorary and
unpaid, a fact which caused lack of esteem for the job. there was little
interest in membership and the association had to be financially supported by
the group of parish library committees, the members' employers. hostility has
been met from the librarians' association and later the librarians' union,
unnecessarily, as the part-time librarians on the whole recognise the ultimate
goal of full-time libraries staffed by professional librarians, but insist on
satisfactory transitional arrangements. there should be a chance for part-time
librarians through supplementary courses to qualify as librarians, and it is
possible for the professionals and the non-profess ionals to work side by side.

using libraries and schools for other purposes outside opening hours is a
natural and good consequence of their developing liaison with other cultural
activities. the tradition of charging at most a nominal rent is less
defensible. extra use involves upkeep and staffing costs, and organisations
may rent unsuitable premises for financial reasons. the district centre at
lyngen, norway, housing a wide range of organisations and a potential example
of integrated activity, has to charge a rent unacceptable to smaller groups.
for effective use, all cultural premises should have the same financial
standing and joint administration. in planning or conversion, the needs of
individual users should be analysed and coordinated. the librarian, for
instance, should be able to rent certain areas full-time (e.g. the necessary
space for storing equipment, shelving and books) and other areas for the
library's actual opening hours, outside which they could be used  by other
organisations.

alesund central library, norway, opened in sept 80 as part of a major
administrative building. the project had undergone long and controversial
discussion and the librarian was not involved at the planning stage, an
unsatisfactory situation. the library (with more and romsdal county library)
now occupies centrally placed premises of 2400 sq.m. though its long, narrow
shape is awkward and rather cramped. a walkway with stairs, ramps and a lift
from ground level helps to compensate for the library's situation on the 1st
floor. the public are very pleased with the warm, attractive interior. an
internal lift gives access to basement stacks; the main departments are all on
the 1st floor, but the 2nd floor houses offices and a complex of public rooms

university libraries and universities are faced with the problem of how to
make academic university work clear and intelligible to the outsider. 1 way is
through well-organised public exhibitions in university libraries. an
exhibition which was organised by students of the history of art department at
freiberg university in june/july 80 was an excellent example of this type of
activity. the students arranged contact with the media, the actual exhibition
objects, contact with the artists, publicity, an opening at which the artists
were present, guides to the exhibition, workshops, talks and public
discussions. all the library had to do was provide the exhibition rooms. the
exhibition was extremely successful and acted as a stimulus to other groups
within the university to organise similar exhibitions to present their current
work projects to the public.

after a review of heuristics and heuristic information some aspects of mission

information staff should be aware that relevant information may be located by
searching fields other than the user's speciality. in addition to the
traditional sources, an interdisciplinary approach assists in the exploitation
of such materials as reports in methodological surveys, research reports and
dissertations. sociological information can be of heuristic value in
epidemiological research. however, heuristic information will be serviceable
only if the librarian is familiar with the scientist's aims and field of
research.

summary of research carried out in 1981 by the ivory coast national

situation of the ivory coast, the most developed of the former african
colonies. a detailed investigation of information services was effected to
establish whether information provision produced development, or resulted from
it. details are given of resources and services, national and international
network links, expenditure, and government information policy. formal and
informal communication channels are analysed with particular reference to the
national library and national archives, where the excellence of the
collections is not fully exploited because of inadequate resources, as
compared to the electrical energy information centre, which is financially
well supported. recommendations for future policy include cooperation with
other african states, the elaboration of a coherent national information
policy, the imp osition of charges for information services, and the
development of training programmes in information use. the evidence, it is

a great number of specialist and non-specialist questions are asked about
scientific research, concerning objectives, methods, results, organisation,
policies and information sources. such questions can be collected and analysed
for common denominators but recent work by andrews and his collaborators
(1979) indicates this approach to be inadequate. uses simon's concept of
limited rationality as a general model of individual and organisational
operation, which is applied as an analytical framework for investigating
research activities. the model does help in explanation of observations
frequently made about research behaviour patterns' preference for informal
information sources and personal contacts, and the formation of informal
groups and networks. researchers and their organisations would appear to
function within the boundaries of limited rationality. this model can also be
used to predict pote ntial problems in scientific communication, such as the
conception and use of thesauri and data banks. the quality of such information
sources is crucial to the future of scientific research, hence the importance
of understanding research behaviour.

the progress of user training for students at the erfurt/mulhausen college of

subject and to impress on them the importance of user training to the
students. it is planned to hold meetings and discussions to show teachers
methods of user training and of putting the acquired knowledge to the test.
student user training consists of a tour around the library, and library
departments, lectures in college and at the library and practical tests in
using catalogues and other information sources. the knowledge gained by the
students should be employed in working independently in the catalogue section,
using a wider range of reference literature and preparing their final thesis.

based on document titles, developed for this study to rate judgements and
collect data. results are reported in full and analysed; the calculation
procedures are explained and demonstrated. it was concluded that user and
non-user judgements were largely similar; disagreements were attributed to
inconsistencies between subjective user and objective non-user evaluation
criteria. finally the effectiveness of titles in determining rel evance was
considered, and the conclusion drawn that frequency of profile descriptors in

describes the deposit library and its space problems. unless the library moves
from its present accommodation in the basement of the library school within
half a year, it will have to start refusing books from public libraries. the
library's purpose is to store books which have been culled from public
libraries and to lend or give them to other libraries, and therefore it must
necessarily grow at a time when other libraries contract. the library began in
1968 with 1400 sq.m.; later a further 175 sq.m. were added for shelving and
1000 sq.m. in a warehouse elsewhere. a suitable building of 7700 sq.m. is now
available cheaply. with an increase of 25,000 volumes a year, this would
secure enough space until the 90s. running costs will be 5.1 million kr. in 82
as compared to the present 3.6 million kr., and cost of establishment will be
2.7 million kr. the danish library association, the national association of
local authorities and the librar y council have now recommended that the money
should come from the public libraries' disposition fund, not otherwise used
for such purposes, as the source of the library's finance, the public
libraries' joint appropriation, would be unable to cope. the library is a last
resort, after the central libraries, for ordinary people for the lending of
older books and meets 55% of enquiries, a figure which would be higher if a
catalogue of holdings existed.

statements by the danish librarians' union show that librarians know nothing
about work in the technical departments and issue desks, where office trained
staff, not librarians, work; they therefore tend to reject automation in these
areas. they are, on the other hand, trained in bibliographical services and
hence approve of automation of these. the fact is, however, that present
manual issue control systems are working very poorly' books are being recalled
which are already returned or have never been borrowed. refers to a neglected
report of 1979 by a committee of heads of issue desks, which recommends
experiments with automated issue control systems and in particular supports an
automatic recall system. the issue desk staff of the automated olstykke

authority control is the set of procedures which determines the use of

essential because' catalogues are growing and becoming more difficult to use
so the user may easily get lost without an authority structure to provide
guidance; and if libraries follow generally the same standards in establishing
bibliographic records, the task of matching records among libraries will be
made considerably easier.

constitutes one of the components of the developing malaysian research library
network. the project began in oct 77 as an experiment as a result of a
feasibility study, and became an operational system in july 79. during the
experimental period, costing studies were undertaken and these revealed that
for all the participating institutions, an automated cataloguing system was
cheaper than the manual system. the malmarc system is currently being operated
by the malmarc coordinating centre at the universiti sains malaysia. details

findings of an examination of the methods, benefits and costs of linking the
'bibliographic utilities', focusing on the following issues: (1) oclc,
rlg/rlin, wln and the library of congress were considered initial candidates
for linking; (2) attempts to determine the benefits for public and academic
libraries of linking 2 or more utilities; (3) the analysis was restricted to
bibliographic records for monographs; (4) assessed the impact of linking on
shared cataloguing, interlibrary loan, and reference searching; (5) examined
the benefits of the lc cataloguing function; and (6) the technical evaluation
concentrated on link alternatives that are technologically feasible today and
could be implemented within the next 3 or 4 years.

the growth of oclc as an automated library resource-sharing system has been
made possible in part by intermediary organisations, or networks, that
function as marketing and distributing agents for oclc services. as they have
grown, the networks have taken on other roles. the results of a survey of the
directors of the networks reveal patterns of service beyond oclc, and indicate
that the networks provide, or plan to provide, automated library support
systems themselves. survey results also reveal brokerage of other automated

successive revisions in cataloguing codes have posed special problems for
music materials primarily because the economics of music publishing have

the history of cataloguing pseudonyms is reviewed. aacr2 reverses a

aacr2's own internal logic. the number of disadvantages to this rule far
outweigh any advantages. it should be replaced.

in research libraries and fulfil their purpose which is to bridge the time gap
until rak is published in book form. rak-wb provides a basis for cataloguing
in research libraries demonstrating the desired uniformity in all important
points. its use will lead to uniform processing at all stages of
classification which is necessary for cooperative cataloguing and data
exchange. its value is increased by the many amendments and improvements which
went into its make-up as a result of years of practical experience with rak.
rak-wb has been quickly adopted by the rapidly expanding library associations.

test and measure both inter and intraconsistency. details are given of the
methodology used here in a restricted study involving 10 indexers and 1
article, and results presented in full, showing the number of terms assigned
in relation to length of time spent; consistency between terms; and frequency

and lower-rank concepts, and selection and reduction), some of which may
interfere with scientific and technical information retrieval precision
(especially in computerised systems). to eliminate such interference, proposes
that' a formula specifying information need more precisely should be
introduced; while indexing, subject (rather than document) content should be
described; concept characteristics, rather than unified key words, should be
used; process-oriented words should be used to describe changes in time;
higher-rank concepts should be used only if they adequately cover all
subordinated concepts; and elements for information retrieval should not be
mixed with those aimed at content description.

the classification described is a shortened version of a classification used
for a classified catalogue of general linguistics and originally devised for
the systematic documentation of essays and dependent works at the institute of
general linguistics in munster. since the essays are on highly specialised
subjects, a classification of great depth was needed which, because of costs
and organisational problems, had to be operable manually. manual procedures
also reduce the risk of faulty indexing. the classification is strictly
hierarchic since it must be capable of vertical and horizontal expansion
without risk of structural alteration. work on the scheme began in 1978; the
21 main classes are listed with their subordinate sections.

user perception of data importance and the economic feasibility of hardware
and storage devices will determine the future direction of on-line systems. a
retrieval system's functions are ultimately dictated by data base design.
early on-line systems were designed for bibliographic information limited to
citations only using sequential files. now full text information, numeric
information, and manipulative systems are being perceived by a class of users
not interested in specialised vocabulary skills. these users are placing
demands that will require sophisticated internal technology, improved and
expanded storage capability, more sophisticated file structure, and
transparent data manipulative devices. the economic potential of these demands
will bring about the development of a new generation of multitiered data bases
that allow users at all skill levels to approach them. the point is that, as
the user's need for types of data to be retrieved changes, so must the data
base technology change. report not available from ntis.

such an on-line system are fast access to large quantities of data and the
opportunity to refine the enquiry by conversing with the computer. at present,
data bases can be used to determine if a translation of a document, or an
alternative, already exists. they can assist with translating particular words

appropriate role of user fees. the ways in which libraries have integrated
on-line searching into more traditional library services have implications for
future technology-based innovations. a california library association survey
of publicly-supported libraries found a large number offering searches, nearly
half at no charge to the users; and that user fees differed according to where
the search was performed and whether the user or the librarian was seen as its

a paper prepared for the 1981 association des bibliothecaires francais (abf)
conference discussing future prospects for the press in relation to the
challenge of other media. surveys the history of the press in general since
the invention of printing, and shows that today the public prefers press
reportage of important events to radio and television coverage. since the war,
technological developments have increased the efficiency of the press as well
as promoting rival media. despite social changes and improved living
standards, radio and television have not replaced the press, but rather
supplement it. the effects of local radio and national information networks
remain to be seen, but unlike radio and television, the press is not state
controlled. the public has always looked to the press for comment and news in
eventful times, and will probably continue to do so.

outlines the general development and problems connected with the current
national bibliography. proceeds with a short description of the history and
function of the national bibliographies of the comecon countries. national
bibliographies are financed by the government and compiled by bibliographical
centres attached to national libraries. the development of national
information systems in the 1960s increased the coordinating function of the
centres. current national bibliographies of monograph publications are
supplemented by bibliographies of periodicals and special bibliographies by
subject, form, publisher etc. ends with the state of the art in coordination
and cooperation among the comecon countries.

bibliographic catalogues collect, describe and arrange a complexity of data

work, on the thirty-nine articles of religion, was published in 1715, and
consisted of 18 copies of the articles, 5 in latin and 13 in english. bennet
reproduced exactly the text of one master copy in each language, and then
recorded, in footnotes on the same page, every variation to be found in every
other copy. details of evidence were then analysed, and conclusions drawn. a

statistics on the publication and sale of books in hungary reveal a large
increase in the amount of material published since 1970, mostly produced by
the 19 official publishers. book prices are relatively low; on average each
individual buys 10 books per year. library purchases have doubled during the
last 10 years, owing to improvements in schooling and the quick rise of the
general cultural level. in the last 14 years the number of families owning
books has doubled and the number of families owning more than 300 books has
trebled. the amount of reading done has not increased at an equal rate because
of television. more non-fiction is published and purchased than fiction,

the international standard book number is well known as a title identifier in

monographs appearing on the uk marc record, and as a stock-item identifier in
the book trade. equally well-known is the helpful characteristic that isbns
exhibit whereby their 10th and final character serves as a check-digit,
minimising data entry errors. other well-known identifiers, such as the
library of congress number and the british national bibliography number which

discusses the principles for the future structure of copyright which are
embodied in the revision committee's report on proposed changes in that part
of the copyright act which refers to private copying. the majority wish to see
free copying in single copies for private use, but to restrict professional
multiple copying. this restriction is particularly aimed at the new media'
sound and videotapes, which have led to mass use. there has always been a
conflict between the rights of copyright holders to economic profit from their
works and the right of society to free enjoyment of cultural values. upholds
the basic principle of the owner's sole right, but points to ways of solving
copyright conflicts in a mass use situation via licence agreements. today,
where technology has made collective exploitation of works of art possible it
is natural to seek these agreements with organisations rather than individual
artists. recommends that such licence agreements be concl uded, and that
copyright holders organise themselves so as to ease the administration of
agreements.

applied research and concludes that knowledge in certain disciplines is best
communicated using the traditional print-on-paper format, while communication

device, followed by data transmission to the computer and (2) crt entry of
observed values for test and control animals for specific tests. only after
verification of data accuracy by the information producer are the results

criticises conventional studies of library history for failing to appreciate
that libraries are essentially part of an interlocking complex of institutions
forming a particular social structure, which itself is determined by the
historical process. shows how dialectical materialism can be used to deal with
social entities as part of a totality of positive and negative factors, and
emphasises the necessity of viewing history as a process and not as finite.
once this is understood, it becomes possible to place the study of libraries
on a recognisable scientific basis, as a complex of practices which are
ultimately socially determined.

fishman studied librarianship in the usa immediately after world war i and it
is then that he wrote this article, originally published in hapoel hatzair.
library collections in eretz-yisrael are unplanned and not systematic, because
they are based almost exclusively on gifts, rather than purchases. librarians
must not obligate themselves to catalogue gift collections in toto, but must
leave themselves free to choose only what is needed and to give away or
exchange the rest. he calls for the foundation of a national union catalogue
in jerusalem with far-reaching centralised powers to transfer books from 1
library to others where they will be more useful.

a study was undertaken to identify the amount and kinds of professional
journal reading being done by acrl (association of college and research
libraries) academic librarians, with data drawn from 2 separate surveys made
over a 5-year period of time. questionnaires were sent to a sample of acrl
members in 1973 and again in 1978, which ascertained how many journals they
were reading regularly and what the titles of those journals were.
illustrations provide a comparison of most frequently read titles for 1973 to
1978, with the percentage of reader response for each title. for both years
surveyed, acrl academic librarians averaged approximately 7 journals read on a
regular basis. a separate analysis of the 1978 data indicated that 7 of the
titles cited as being read accounted for 80% of the journal reading. as had
been the case in 1973, more than 9 in 10 of these academic librarians were
regular readers of college & research librar ies. however, several other
titles heavily cited in 1973 lost readership among acrl members due to the
dramatic appearance of the journal of academic librarianship.

funded research only, but is helped also by its proximity to canada's largest
research library at the university of toronto. for a research project in
librarianship to be successful, the problem must be of current interest so
that it can attract funds, it must be an area in which one specialises, and
help must be sought from other experts. explains what a research problem is
and how it is formulated in terms of the whole research process. discusses the
research into the relationship between personality traits and effective
library management, and argues that researchers should resolve problems which
hinder decision-making, but they should not make the decisions themselves.
research methods is a compulsory subject in the university's mls programme,

text of a discussion with w.m.e. vintges who retired from her post as head of
library affairs at the netherlands bibliotheek en lectuur centrum (dutch
centre for libraries and literature) in nov 81. until 1962 mrs vintges had
been head of the roman catholic public library at tilburg, a post which
involved her in serving on a number of national committees. in 1962 mrs.
vintges was appointed general consultant with the centrale vereniging voor
openbare bibliotheken (central association for public libraries) and joined
the staff of the nblc in 1972. mrs vintges feels that the government's view of
public libraries is too restricted and that public libraries as a basic
service for education and social welfare should no longer be regarded as
purely the responsibility of local authorities.

in the ussr, interest in the theoretical side of these subjects has grown
recently, therefore it is necessary to establish the current state of these
scientific disciplines, their relationship with each other and with other
disciplines. descriptions are given of' presentation of research methods and
structure of the theoretic bases; soviet concepts of the theory of library
science, bibliography and informatics; estimates of the completeness and
consistency of current theories; principles of limitation; coordination of the
interpretation of objects studied; and results of the investigation, which
reveal that more work on this basic study is needed.

paper presented at the 14th brazilian seminar on informatics and library
science, sao paulo, 16-23 oct 81. the library of today is described with
reference to recent organisational and technical innovations, within the
context of its long history of development. to fulfil its responsibilities of
collecting, processing and disseminating information in the 1980s, the library
has become increasingly reliant on information analysis; the availability of
new techniques and technology has freed professionals from many traditional
tasks and professional training has altered greatly in scope and orientation.
compares and contrasts the roles of the librarian and the information
scientist in a society like brazil undergoing rapid development, pointing out
the potential danger in lack of communication between them when complementing
cooperation is essential to meet economic and social needs.

discusses the findings of a survey of the public and self image of librarians
and information officers. uses questionnaire material supplied by uk
library-information workers to describe how these professionals see
themselves, and to construct an ideal image of each profession. considers the
significance of 2 of the study's findings' (1) that a relatively high
proportion of people working in the profession want to get out; and (2) that
compared with the proportion of such groups in other professions, librarians
and information workers seemed to display a fairly high level of ambivert
motivation, which indicates a balanced and rounded motivation and type of
personality. also concludes that the public image of the librarian is in the
process of change.

analyses the concept of 'information' and the meanings which the term has
acquired. after a discussion of the various definitions of information,
suggests that the definition of the concept should be a synthetic and positive
expression-an essential entity which is generated in the context of the

becomes the substance and essence of any communication.

debates concerning the concept of 'information' emphasise several important

certain delimitations, underlining the intricate relationships between
information and its significance, and between information and thought. argues
against the use of the term information in the mathematical sense, considering
it terminologically confusing.

argues for the development of librarianship training programmes that will
truly prepare the professional to meet the needs of a work market determined,
in brazil, by the social conditions of economic development. there is now an
increasing demand for librarians, but library schools do not gear their
programmes to provide training for actual social situations. once the nature
of the market needs is understood, training policies can be adapted
accordingly. illustrates the argument with reference to the public library and
university library fields, emphasising the necessity for practical abilities
and professional awareness.

provided by any academic institution in austria and is therefore carried out
by libraries and information centres. library education is divided into
categories a, b, and c according to the level of general education of
students. a-university education, b-secondary school certificates,

contribution to a thematic issue on library training. laszlo matrai has
suggested that library science does not exist and that a librarian should be a
scientist of the subject field cared for and served by him, but by no means a
library scientist. thus library skills should be attained by practice. the
author feels that the transmission of information in a library is a complex
operation, requiring training at a higher education level. this training,
incorporating up-to-date knowledge, is the essence of the library profession
and is essential in the development of information systems and networks.

the department of librarianship and information science at the faculty of
philosophy within the comenius university in bratislava has been in existence
for 30 years. at present, both full-time and part-time undergraduate and
postgraduate courses are offered. in accordance with the new ideas in the
czechoslovak system of higher education, curricula has recently been subjected
to profound and sometimes controversial changes. the duration of undergraduate
courses has been reduced from 5 to 4 years. it will concentrate on
librarianship and/or information science as well as on closely related
subjects. the aim of equipping students with the basic knowledge in the field
of their prospective type of library has been abandoned. although it fell
short of expectations, the extension of the department's building will
nevertheless enable the teaching and other staff to build up resources of
audio-visual aids and other illustrative materials,  and also to involve their

the school of librarianship in bratislava was founded in 1953, simultaneously
with similar schools in prague and brno. after overcoming considerable
difficulties of various kinds in the 1st 10 years of its history, the school
has concentrated in educating and training prospective non-graduate librarians
and information scientists. so far about 3,000 students have completed their
full-time or part-time courses. almost 90% of them work in libraries and in
centres of scientific, technical and economic information. commencing in the
academic year 1984-85, new syllabuses will come into force. the courses
offered will be full-time only. after 2 years with a common curriculum,
students will take up either librarianship or information science for the
remaining 2 years, when final examinations of a theoretical and practical
nature will be held. the new project, worked out under the auspices of the
research institute for vocational education and  training in prague, will
become a further step towards providing libraries and information centres with

having mentioned briefly the importance of libraries to society, and also
courses offered for prospective non-graduate and graduate librarians and
information scientists in slovakia, discusses continuing education and
in-service training of library and information centre staff. since 1976, the
said concept has enjoyed official backing by regulations issued by the slovak
ministry of culture. the regulations are binding on all central and other
major libraries. so far, the most important training projects have been
launched by matica slovenska and by the slovak technical library. in-service
courses should not only include lectures, but also work in seminars and
smaller groups. visits to selected libraries and discussions with their staff
stimulate the exchange of views and ideas. films and other illustrative
materials must be used more fully. graduates, continuing their studies abroad,
must be encouraged to concentrate on topical proble ms, and to aim at posts
with responsibility. users of library and information services have to be
educated and trained, too, to make the best of the resources available.
starting with undergraduates, the scheme must be expanded to involve the whole
nation in future.

report on a 2-year-scheme introduced by the central regional library in ruse,
to encourage continuing education of librarians in the region through private
study. initially, 75 topics were offered, and 94% of full-time librarians took
part in the scheme. even professional librarians with 10, 15 and more years of
service were not excluded from theoretical, controversial and/or innovative
themes. they also widely explored soviet periodicals and literature in
russian. the attitude and response of beginners and some library assistants
appeared to be less enterprising and enthusiastic, in some cases even formal.
it is hoped, however, that their professional ethics will improve in future.
regular meetings with their tutors, resulting in the inevitable exchange of
views and opinions were of beneficial influence in the study. a positive
evaluation of the scheme must be followed by further experimentation,
searching and striving for improve ment.

union for lack of policy on education for librarianship, which is the subject
of a committee of the ministry of culture, and urges it to initiate a debate
among the members. the group presents its own suggestions' minor subjects
should be gathered in larger subject groups; account should be taken in
teaching of the trend to libraries staffed by a single librarian; the use of
computers should not be a subject on its own, but taught in connection with
all subject areas; teaching of russian could be confined to teaching of
transliteration under cataloguing; the teaching of literature and information
retrieval should give a theoretical basis for searching within any subject
area and not aim to give thorough knowledge of particular subjects; and the
new unified course should not include specialisation, but emphasise the common
aspects of education for librari anship.

text of a paper delivered at a symposium in the cuban national library in
1978. the collection until recently contained very little manuscript material
of particular interest, and no staff were trained in spanish palaeography. in
1945 a general archive training course, which included palaeography, was held,
using photocopies of originals. since 1959, many long-standing projects have
been realised, including the acquisition of large manuscript collections
dating from the 16th century, containing important documents for the study of
cuba's history. accordingly, since 1962, new training programmes in spanish
palaeography have been initiated. details are given of the new material still
being added to the archive.

from almost its inception in 1937, archival education and training has been
primarily a post-employment effort. this is attributed to the indifference of
the professional associations in both the fields of librarianship and history,
the 2 main disciplines from which manuscript librarians and archivists are
drawn. between 1937-40 and 1967-70, the american library association became
peripherally interested. the history profession has become more active since
the early 1970s in its search for alternative careers for aspiring historians.
individual library schools also have been offering archival management courses
since the early 1960s particularly. by lacking academic status, the american
literature in the archival field has also been underdeveloped, and this has
contributed to the slowness in developing adequate intellectual control of
archival/manuscript sources. an attempt in 1967-70 to develop an archival
manual withi n a.l.a. died aborning and the historical associations and
society of american archivists have just begun to cope with the problem
independently. practicing archivists of necessity will continue to be the main
teacher pool and contributors to the literature until regular faculty in
library schools and history departments have been adequately trained, but 1st
a basic reorientation must occur that recognises that records and papers of
contemporary society are the central problem.

beginning with a detailed analysis of 24 published surveys and programmes of

maintaining the identity of 'core studies' in professional curricula. the
content and objectives of computer courses are listed and discussed. the
coverage of the author's own survey is explained. all 17 schools in the uk, 1
in dublin and 13 in eastern usa and canada were visited in 1978 involving
interviews with over 130 people individually or in groups. 10 schools overseas
provided further data in questionnaires. the results of the survey begin by
summarising the various stated objectives for computer courses. there follows
a review of the structure of such courses and the views on options in this
subject. outlining the titles, content, duration and staf fing, reviews, with
supporting tables, courses for computer appreciation, programming and library
automation. separate tables and commentary cover the data from the
questionnaires. in the conclusions, it is emphasised that computing is now an
essential part of professional education, though how much and for whom is not
yet decided. advanced courses will soon be needed for those wishing to
specialise.

the museum was administered by a group of members with literary and scientific

for which the museum became a reading-room until 1915; the weimar book museum;
the carl zeiss foundation. many private members also donated their journals to
the museum. when the public reading room opened in jena in 1896, reflecting
the development of cultural and political thought, it flourished; the museum,
in contrast, wished to remain the preserve of a well-educated, fee-paying

nationalbibliothek (austrian national library) describes its function and
present organisational structure. designated the national library in the 1920s
the library is also the centre for foreign materials in humanities. the main
duties of the library are' systematic acquisition of materials, administration
of interlibrary loans, compilation of the austrian national bibliography, the
austrian publications collection (austriatica), conversion of the author
catalogue into international format, retrospective indexing, reader services
including exhibitions, participation in international library activities and a
role in library education. these tasks are carried out by the library's 9
departments whose basic characteristics are given.

the blld was formed in 1973 through the amalgamation of the national central
library and the national lending library for science and technology. the aim
is that almost all orders from other libraries shall be fulfilled from the
library's own stock and processed the same day. this necessitates a
comprehensive acquisition policy, efficient work routines, and central
location, at boston spa. its gift & exchange section serves a useful function
as deposit for withdrawn material from other libraries. a music collection is
being built up. the largest departments are those for serials and books, and
total stock comprises 4 million volumes and 2.5 million documents or fiches.
all periodicals, but mainly english language monographs only, are acquired.
special attention is given to coverage of russian scientific and technical
publications. describes the selection methods. the routines are simple and few
of the staff have higher education, emphasis bei ng on administrative skills.
the services pay for themselves overall and the budget is generous. use of
back-up libraries is made, mostly the legal deposit libraries. various
catalogues are available, including the union catalogue of books listing the
holdings of blld and some other libraries.

against the background of an analysis of firstly, the need for and functions
of communication in society; secondly, the functions of the record as a means
of communication; and thirdly, the role of the public library as an agent of
communication in activating the record, the essential functions of the public
library are stated as the advancement of culture, the provision of useful
information, and recreation. then the question is considered whether the
provision of recreational materials 2per se1 should be a function of the
public library and whether the public library is not weakening its position in
society by providing recreational reading materials on a large scale, thus
competing with commercial sources of recreation.

a comprehensive and critical survey arguing the urgent need to provide equal
levels of service for both urban and rural users. in general, the public sees
libraries as out of date, under-resourced, and unattractive, and is largely
unaware of recent new developments because these are restricted to a few
centres of excellence. the public library should provide free comprehensive
services for all' describes these services in detail, as they relate to
documentation and information, and cultural activities. the division of
library services into urban and rural structures has resulted in inadequate
services for country areas; instead, the system should be reorganised into a
network pattern to equalise distribution of resources. criticisms of municipal
libraries, central lending libraries, and the french public library service in
general are summarised in an appended memorandum, and further illustrated by
an analysis of the organisation of services in the cambrai region.

after the socialist revolution in bulgaria in 1944, almost 62% of public
libraries were allocated larger premises. 5 of the central regional libraries,
established as such in 1953, moved into new buildings, while 2 other buildings
were erected for libraries in higher education. in spite of these
improvements, there is still a considerable shortage of space in libraries,
which, in general, are also in need of modernisation. reprographic equipment,
computer application and communication technology must not only ensure better
lending services, including interlending, but also comprehensive information
resources as well as a wider dissemination of information. like other
countries, mobile libraries should cater for hamlets and small communities of
some 1,000 inhabitants, and also for urban populations living on new housing
estates and/or in other areas temporarily without libraries. purpose-built
buildings should be envisaged for e very library with 70,000 and more volumes.
depository libraries, both on a national and regional level, should also be
planned to store valuable books and rarely requested books.

describes delhi public library, opened in 1951. borrowing is free, although
there is an initial deposit too high for many people. the library runs 4
regional libraries with 20 branch libraries, eventually to be self-governing.
it also has deposit collections in 3 hospitals, the prison, and institutions
for the blind, using the library's own braille books. materials have to be in
many languages, with hindi, urdu, punjabi and english the most common. there
is an adult lending section, reading room, reference section, and children's
section; the latter is, however, given low priority. the library arranges free
activities for adults and children, such as films, book-talks, author
work-shops, and organises study groups. the book selection procedures are
somewhat haphazard; stress is on indian and western classics. some popular
scientific works are now available in hindi. delhi public library appears a
traditional western library service, with little attempt to cater for the mass
of illiterate and potential users.

traces the evolving conceptions of the role and objectives of the sha'ar zion
public library as formulated by its founders, librarians and the town fathers
during the period of the 1st 4 waves of zionist immigration, from the 1880s to
1931. the emphasis is on analysis of the clash between the concept of the
popular public library, whose primary purpose was to serve predominantly the
immediate and topical needs of the immigrants and help in their absorption,
and the concept of the scholarly public library, which emphasises the
provision of services to a limited clientele of scholars, writers and teachers
in the field of jewish studies. opens with a description of the social
background of the period. the 2nd part deals with the origins of the sha'ar
zion library and the contribution of voluntary organisations such as the b'nai
brith and  b'nai moshe orders towards the formulation of its mission. the 3rd
and 4th sections analyse the deliberations and contentions of members of the
town council and of advisors with regard to library objectives during the
period of the 3rd and 4th waves of immigration (1919-31). in the last section,
attempts to draw some conclusions with regard to the role played by the public
library in palestine in the process of realisation of zionist ideology,
especially its function as an agency for educating the populace in the spirit
of that ideology, and in realising the ideal of the creation of a new jewish
society in palestine which would preserve and maintain its cultural excellence
and supremacy.

oslo, with 456,000 inhabitants, enjoys a public library service from 2 main
centres-the university library (ubo) and the deichmanske biblioteket. the ubo
serves both as a university and national library, thereby creating a series of
difficulties in the structural organisation of the service. bibliographic work
has been facilitated by the use of computers, and national and international
bibliographies are in process. the public has a single alphabetical author and
subject catalogue, and bureaucratic formalities have been reduced to a
minimum. the deichmanske is distinguished from other scandinavian libraries by
its widespread service to schools and educational institutes. it aims to
procure and lend books unobtainable from other sources. both libraries leave
the impression of an efficient service which has eliminated all sources of

students in a vocational training school will include former pupils of both
grammar and secondary modern schools. some students will be on part time, some
on full time courses; most of them will have had some work experience and many
will have practical rather than academic ability. the media centre needs a
wide range of subject material for all academic levels. self-teaching
programmes are very important; audio-visual media are particularly helpful in
demonstrating the operation of machinery. some students will have learning
difficulties and a lack of motivation; provision of material for leisure as
well as academic activities should encourage them to use the library, where
they may find their last chance to make up for educational deficits. the media
centre should also promote the idea of job flexibility.

evolutionary changes in the next 10 years. users are perceived to be the force
maintaining the status quo, while technology is the force advancing change.
the adoption of technology is seen as desirable and within the libraries' span
of control. education and service roles of librarians will expand. library and

libraries have a special role in breaking down barriers which prevent
handicapped readers gaining access to printed material. argues that most of
the 50% in denmark who are not library users are more or less handicapped.
some are handicapped from physical causes, and others are slow or new readers
and dyslexics. describes the importance of reading in daily life and the
reasons for lack of skill in reading. outlines rules for language and lay-out
which make a book easier to read and the different types of book aimed at
different groups ('ordinary' books, easy readers, magnaprint, braille, spoken
books, book 0 tape). this kind of material is given too little priority by
publishers and libraries. special care should be taken in design of libraries
to make them accessible to the handicapped. the library must disseminate its
services widely to the handicapped. during the international year it is
important that libraries make a special  effort and are represented on local
organising committees.

with the introduction and increasing prevalence of mainstreaming in schools,
it is inevitable that some students will have to cope with some degree of
disability. disabilities vary tremendously, both in type and degree to which
normal functioning is impaired. it is essential that all students be given the
same consideration and respect regardless of individual differences.
librarians can contribute most by understanding the special difficulties and
needs of the child. abilities rather than disabilities need to be emphasised.
besides psychological and social barriers, the problem of simple physical
access must be considered. design features that must be considered include
access to the building, access within the library and access to all library
services.

the international year for disabled persons 1981 has drawn the attention to
the 8% of the world population who are disabled in some way. considerable
attention has been given to the library needs of these people. in order to
offer them equal rights and equal opportunities as able persons in the
library, several requirements for the physical lay-out and equipment should be
considered. blind persons have a well-coordinated south african library
service with books in braille or moon print and books on tape at their
disposal. almost all other disabled persons can rely with confidence on the
service of their nearby library. special attempts will be made to supply them
with books, in general as well as aimed at their specific needs. e.g. how to
adapt to their way of living as disabled persons (dealing with the practical
aspects like clothing and housing) and how to accept reality (healing of the

stocks of braille works total 7,700, comprising 26,700 volumes, since works in
braille require more volumes than normal print books. books include fiction
and non-fiction for children and adults and literature is also provided on
tapes (67,000), cassettes (25,000) and records. sound recordings are
particularly useful for the elderly, who find it hard to learn braille. most
contacts with readers are made by post or telephone, but there is a public

part i of this article appeared in 2biblioteksbladet1 66 (6) 1981 (+s+e+e

very important for the supply of talking books. 1200 titles annually are
produced for loan in libraries, of which the tpb accounts for 900. the
selection of books includes all easy readers and 25% of production are books
for children and young people. the aged form the largest user group. braille
books are now in a minority; they are lent directly to readers. catalogues of
the tpb's stock and new acquisitions are being prepared using the bums data
base. some books for immigrants are available. as a loan centre the tpb is
obliged to lend to different institutions and collate information on local
library stocks. it aims to develop the decentralisation of talking book
provision and therefore wishes to transfer to the local public library the
responsibility for direct lending to individuals and purchase of an adequate
stock from the library service.

library work for children and young people, leipzig, aug 81. the basic theme
was discussed with reference to individual countries in africa, asia and latin
america, where many children attend school only briefly or not at all, so they
remain illiterate. many parents are also illiterate so reading in leisure
hours is not encouraged. what school books and lessons there are exist only in
an official language, generally that of a colonising power. there is a lack of
published material in local languages, some of which have never even been

lecture given at the ifla/unesco seminar in leipzig, aug 81. in pre-colonial
times education in mali was provided within the family; in the colonial
periods, the mediaeval berbers and 19th century french established some
schools and libraries. between 1960 and 1980, after independence, the
education system was reformed and a literacy campaign promoted in the
country's 4 main languages. since the 1970s 46 public libraries have been
opened, each of which contains a children's department. keypoints in the
development of children's libraries are the production of suitable literature,
stock expansion and staff training, a programme coordinated by the central
library for children's literature in bamako. librarians, authors and
publishers are working together to make collections of national legends and
stories, organise cultural events and encourage library use.

aware of the value of books. details are given of the organisation and
operation of the 2 schemes, where conventional library practices have been

conditions are illustrated by a description of children's libraries in bendel
province, where children's departments in public libraries and school
libraries have been established since the 1970s. reference departments in
large libraries also stock some material for children. library staff organise
reading sessions, films, dancing and artistic activities and hope to develop
these further and to expand readership. bendel's school library service is
administered by a centre in charge of all purchasing and loans. short training
courses are organised for teacher-librarians and public library assistants

educational reform cannot take place without the inclusion of the basic
cultural technology. particular success in this field has been shown in the 3
combined school and public libraries in hanover, which contains a wide range
of material and equipment for class and individual study and for leisure
activities. if purchasing, processing and control of school library media
stocks are to be integrated into centralised public library services, the
right to financial provision must be guaranteed. more clarity is needed
regarding the calculation of processing costs; staffing costs should be borne
by local government, material and binding costs by the schools. some problems
concerning the organisation of use procedures, e.g. ticket writing and fine
collection, remain unsolved.

the contribution by a member of the danish library association's executive
committee to a debate on school libraries held at the danish school library
association's annual meeting, oct 81. argues that the ministry of culture in
its library bill has disregarded the library commission's proposals for school
libraries. although research libraries were not included in the 1964 library
act, a unified library system was brought about with the inclusion of school
libraries. the ideal of unity is now being set aside. but if the school
libraries are to be transferred to the schools, the minimum demand to ensure
their existence must be by-laws governing their relationship to public
libraries and a separate budget. these requirements were confirmed by the
minister of culture. yet the library bill makes no mention of them and reduces
the separate budget to an accounting item in the local authority finances. the
bill is, therefore, totally unacceptable to the danish li brary association.

lecture given to the conference of librarians in lower saxony, celle, apr 81.
since 1979 the school library centre in hanover has provided centralised
purchasing, processing and advisory services for the school libraries in its
area. the question as to whether school libraries should be run by librarians
or teachers is still disputed. school libraries are particularly important in'
the reformed grammar school, where they promote independent study and
cooperation between teachers and pupils; schools open all day, where the
library becomes a communication centre catering for leisure as well as
academic activity; vocational training schools, where they cater for students
from all levels of secondary education, provide special help for foreign
students with language problems and develop possibilities for job flexibility.
clear, preferably binding, regulations on cooperation between school and
public libraries are needed.

report of a paper given at the 1981 annual meeting of denmark's school library
association by lise ostergaard. the controversy over the transfer of
responsibility for danish school libraries to the ministry of education from
the ministry of culture is reviewed. it is the task of the local authorities,
however, to ensure the operation and development of public and school
libraries, so that they work together in promoting cultural, informational and
educational activities. the change in the law governing school libraries is a
step forward, strengthening cooperation between the various types of library
controlled by central government and local authorities. production of books
for children and young people is important and has increased greatly in
denmark over the last 10-20 years, largely due to the expansion of children's
libraries. 80% of all danish children's books are purchased by public, school
and institutional libraries. the fut ure of such books depends on the
willingness of local authorities, in spite of budgetary problems, to provide
young people with a broad range of literature.

discusses the role of the library in elementary and junior high schools as
prescribed by brazilian state legislation, and suggests closer integration of
school and library tasks. details are given of the structure of school
organisation, which assigns the library to the category of technical support
for teaching programmes and designates it an extra-curricular activity.
criticises this as an inadequate conception of the library's role, and argues
for active collaboration in the teaching process, as a back-up multi-media
resource centre. examines the official functions of the library, and shows how
insufficient resources are provided for the fulfilment of even its nominal
tasks. in conclusion a restructuring of the school system is proposed,
permitting total integration of library and teaching programmes at all levels.

the functions and organisation of school libraries/media centres as
indispensible prerequisites for the realisation of educational aims have been
discussed since the 1970s, but librarians' high expectations have generally
not been realised. even in comprehensive schools, media centres are still only
on the fringe of school life. the use of a media centre as a focal point of
school activities demands radical changes in school structure and the
teacher's role. many of the media provided are unsuited to the school learning
situation. teachers have to spend much time planning the development of
independent study programmes; close cooperation with school librarians would
prove helpful here. administration of centrally stored media is effective and
economical but since much time is wasted when children move between classroom
and media centre, flexible timetables should be developed.

the school caters for about 90 educationally subnormal children. the media
centre is run by teachers with an assistant on civilian service duty; it is
housed in a multi-purpose room of about 300 sq. m. the centre opens at 7.30
a.m. so that children can use it for leisure and reading activities until
lessons start at 8 a.m. the centre contains books, with an emphasis on
pictorial material, records, video games and cassettes. pupils are given
instruction on using the centre. the school is the regional centre for the
loan of textbook sets. dancing and film sessions are also held in the centre
and pupils can come in again for leisure activities when lessons finish,
before going home at 1 p.m. during afternoons and evenings the centre is used
for conferences, parents' meetings and senior citizens' activities.

since the early 19th century, the value of a centrally situated school library
open to the general public and encouraging a life-long learning process has
been widely discussed. the discussion received fresh impetus after 1970 with
the development of usa, uk and scandinavian school media centres and renewed
interest in the social and educational functions of school libraries.
classrooms must be closely connected with the school media centre; their
evolution into class media centres has only occurred so far in primary
schools, a change demanding good organisation and close links with the public
library system. the triangular relationship classroom-school media
centre-public library can be equated with emunds' '3-tier' library system;
each component must have its tasks clearly defined.

the librarian at a branch library in potsdam works closely with teachers at
the special school nearby, discussing suitable library material and arranging
special events such as authors' visits. children from the lower forms are
brought into the library to sample the books and learn about the library
service; the children enjoy their visits and often return again during leisure
hours. stocks most useful to them are large print books and pictorial
material. the librarian has acquired a good knowledge of individual readers
and their interests. through close cooperation with other libraries,
handicapped readers from other areas often come to use this library. good
contacts with parents are also valuable; a meeting is planned to introduce
parents to literature on different kinds of handicap.

the african library association of south africa has been in existence for 17
years. during this period it has concerned itself with the promotion of the
reading habit among blacks and with the upgrading of the quality of persons
engaged in library work by means of vacation schools and seminars. it has made
representations to local authorities and the government and all those
concerned with the provision of library services for blacks, either to start
library services where these were not in existence or to improve the existing
ones for the benefit of the local inhabitants.

.I 4588
.W
in south africa it often is alleged that blacks require the public library to
offer services by which they can advance their knowledge and capabilities. on
the maslow pyramid this could be considered a need at the basic level, while
the reading of recreative works could be considered to lie at a higher level.
in fact it is found that 72% of books borrowed by blacks consist of fiction.
it may now be questioned whether the black community has already passed the
basic reading level, or whether recreational reading forms part of that level.
as some 66% of the black membership of a library may consist of children, the
high percentage of fiction circulated raises doubts about whether these
children see libraries primarily as sources of information, and about the
suitability of non-fiction provided. only about 5% of blacks use available
library facilities. it should be investigated whether the educational approach
is not being over-stressed in black public libraries.

statistics produced by kopenick district library in berlin between 1969-79
show that each year a considerable number of new users are registered although
the total number of readers grows only slowly. these figures reflect national
trends. the use of the term fluctuation in this context is discussed. users
may leave a library for various reasons' unavoidably, through illness or
death; from social necessity, as when transferring from the children's to the
adult library; for socially acceptable reasons, e.g. moving house, military
service; undesirably, because they find the library service unsatisfactory.
analysis of all available statistics shows that 2/3 of the kopenick residents
do not use the library at all, which again reflects a national trend.

that library staff should know about each reader's requirements from and
motivation towards reading so that the library could perform effectively its
educative function. hofmann advocated the importance of personal contact
between staff and readers and of typological grouping of readers with the aid
of loan frequency statistics. his new classification system for subject
indexes was used in compiling catalogues of the leipzig bucherhalle. hofmann
also favoured the use of selective indexes aimed at target groups in addition

report of a study carried out at the university of montreal in 1980-81, to
investigate under-usage, and the effects of such elements in the internal
system of library organisation and operation as the number of documents
available, staffing arrangements, and hours of opening. data were collected
from a sample of the total population of potential users by interview and
questionnaire, and analysed manually. details are given of calculations to
establish the rate of under-use, and the significance of the effect of the
variables tested. findings showed hours of opening to have the greatest
influence on use. concludes that ultimately the level of staffing is crucial
in promoting library use, and recommends that government regulations on

and use, whereas in quebec interest has been concentrated chiefly on use. the
results of research on use are summarised, and the situation in the usa in

the results are presented of a pilot survey carried out at the humboldt
university in berlin. the 60 students interviewed stressed that personal
contact between lecturer and student was the most important aid to education,
when advice on reading and work methods could be given; they also valued
reading suggestions from other students. at least 1/2 the students interviewed
found the library staff helpful in providing guidance on literature study. the
library was a good place for working, although delays in obtaining books
sometimes held up the study programme. some students felt that concentration
on examinations impeded the growth of creative ability. close contact between
lecturers and librarians is essential for the improvement of stocks and study
methods.

the controversy concerning the relative importance of the public library of
the user 2versus1 the non-user of the library service is considered. the
implication is that the library can be effective only if it applies its
resources towards meeting the cultural needs of the whole community. south
africa in the main lacks research on community needs relevant to library
services. research on the non-user in the uk, the usa and south africa is
briefly reviewed. the library should meet cultural needs from the viewpoint of
the user and not of the librarian. this makes the public library the most
complex of all library types because of its diverse user types. an example is
given of how the cape town city libraries changed its policy in selecting
children's books to satisfy its users' needs more adequately.

the russian people evince a growing demand for books. but where will the paper
for multi-million editions come from? transition to an urban life style has
led to a greater demand for books. many, who are new to book culture, consider
books as proud possessions, not for use. the demand for books is beginning to
resemble that for the mass media. bestsellers exacerbate libraries' problem
situation. bestseller texts should in future be translated to another
information carrier and be disseminated by libraries or the trade. homes and
libraries will still need those books that are intended for the individual
reader.

in order that an information system should comply with the requirements of

the public library is traditionally regarded as a resource for culturally
advanced and literate people. south africa has both developed and developing
communities. while the public library usually focuses on the needs of
established readers, there is a substantial case for providing innovative
forms of service to illiterate and neo-literate communities, and for actually
promoting literacy through the library. the concept of literacy is discussed
in terms of the developed and developing sectors, and literacy is placed in
its cultural context. the problems of semi-illiteracy among educated people
are seen as part of the spectrum of illiteracy, which extends from formally
educated people with poor reading ability to uneducated rural dwellers. the

the adult education movement built up libraries at the beginning of the 20th

connection between the organisations and libraries largely ceased. conscious
of this, orebro regional library in conjunction with 4 public libraries and 4
adult education associations drew up a project supported by the cultural
council for an experimental period of 1 year, with a part-time librarian as
organiser. the aim was to establish contact with the leaders, examine the
associations' needs and how the library could meet them. direct contact with
the class leaders proved difficult and advance notice of books needed hard to
obtain. study visits to the library were made by some groups, and special and
background literature was lent to the groups on long loans. concludes that the
libraries often lacked staff and time to take the necessary initiatives, and
that the study grou p leader is the key to any fruitful contact.

neurotically disturbed patients undergoing group therapy treatment were
presented with 6 literary texts, including works by boll and saint-exupery;
their reactions to them were analysed and compared with those of a group of
people in normal health. the patients regarded the texts subjectively, using
them as a basis for discussion of their own personal difficulties; the others
saw in the texts an objective reflection of general social problems. the
hospital librarian had to find texts that would have a suitable significance
for patients and provide a starting point for the required therapy. it is

for 16 years the siberian department of the an sssr arkheograficheskaya
komissiya, (ussr academy of sciences archaeographic commission), has sought,
listed and described early books and manuscripts from beyond the urals.
treasures discovered on the expeditions enter the history of the book section
of the gosudarstvennaya publichnaya nauchnotekhnicheskaya biblioteka, (state
public scientific and technical library), in novosibirsk. the section's stock
comprises 15,000 items, and grows each year. a recently acquired manuscript
discovered on such an expedition, consisted of a 17th century collection of 10
different works, the central one being a tract addressed to the tsar on the

since 1966, a centralised collection of industrial catalogues and technical
newsletters has been built up at the central scientific and technical library
in bulgaria. in 1979 about 350,000 items were listed. they were supplied by
13,000 companies from all over the world, although the majority were from west
germany, materials in german maintaining a steady 36%. both english (30%) and
russian (9%) are on the increase and while 15% of the catalogues are in
french, the trend shows a slow decline. new acquisitions are listed in a
special bulletin published twice a month and distributed to some 600
subscribers. regular exhibitions take place and with this extensive collection
bulgaria is an active contributor to the special international information
system on industrial catalogues, computerised in 1980. the scheme serves the

form only about 4% of all the monastic collections of manuscripts, which date
mostly from the 15th century. detailed descriptions are given of stocks from'
the putrich monastery, munich; tegernsee; rebdorf; st. emmeran in regensburg;
and the augustine and franciscan monasteries in munich. subject contents

the bavarian state library papyrus collection of 700 items was begun about 80

kept pace with stock increases. the study of papyri is the youngest discipline
connected with antiquities, being developed by mommsen in the 19th century. in
the 1970s, when the collection was moved to larger and better accommodation,
work began on a new catalogue. this catalogue offers primarily editing, with
descriptions of condition, dating and textual characteristics. it is arranged
in 2 main sections' (1) literary texts; (2) official and private letters, each
section being subdivided into edited and unedited works. initial manuscript

are at brunswick technical university and the institute for research into
children's literature at frankfurt university. the library in munich was
founded in 1948 by jella lepman who encouraged the collection of an
international range of modern material and the acceptance of books as gifts
from publishers, institutions and private individuals. walter scharf, who
succeeded her in 1958, began collecting historical as well as contemporary
works and acquired several large collections from other libraries. the munich

bearing in mind the importance of ideological education of every single
citizen in a socialist country, the staff in scientific libraries are bound to
pay due attention to political and other literature in the field of social
sciences. it is desirable to set up special committees which have to find ways
of maximising the effect of political literature upon readers. resolute
policies must be pursued, starting with acquisition, which, in particular with
respect to foreign political literature, must be highly selective. cataloguing
and building up of bibliographic resources must satisfy the readers' needs in
speedy current awareness. exhibitions on the occasion of important political
anniversaries and topical events, establishment of specialised reading and
study rooms, and also more intense research into the use of political
literature are only a few of the suggestions to attract scientists to study
this kind of literature permanently and to bene fit by it in their
professional careers.

a school library is a library first and foremost and must allow the smooth
procedure of bibliographic work in an attractive setting suited to users'
needs. a major problem in older school buildings is the location of a
centrally situated room of suitable size. careful preliminary planning by
administrators, teachers, library authorities, school librarians and the
architect is essential; they must establish the library's role in the school,
teachers' requirements and whether the general public will use the library.
questions to be considered include building materials, furniture, lighting,
flooring and colour schemes. then the architect can prepare plans for which,
after further discussion, estimates can be made.

cooperation and coordination for the improvement of literature supply are the
essential aspects of the local library systems which were set up in the

structures require a degree of current and continuous exchange of information
between the various parts of library systems. local library journals can
contribute considerably to communication on the premises. they make the
library systems intelligible and they serve continuing education and
strengthen the contacts between libraries. as they promote cooperation by the
interlocking and supply of administrative processes, they provide further
rationale for cooperation in local library systems.

interviews karen kobbero, librarian at ballerup gymnasium and author of a
report: project library and education in ballerup. 6 parts deal with senior
secondary schools, preparatory courses, commercial colleges, teacher training
colleges, nursery school training, and technical colleges. public libraries
carry out library services for most of the educational institutions, and it is
time that they began to clarify the problems involved in service to students.
no institution has the responsibility for library services to intermediate
education, and interested teachers and librarians are discouraged by the
authorities. tasks should be distributed between the local public library and
the educational institution, the public library dealing with interlending and
the college with material for project oriented teaching demanding multiple
copies. discusses the kind of material which should be found i n the senior
secondary school. the colleges cannot be self-sufficient in library material
and use of public libraries and the regional resource centres will always be
necessary. registration of old material and withdrawals should be carried out
for the colleges by central library bodies.

of the swedish national library is held by the royal library; the coordinating
role rests with the council of research libraries. the tendency toward

a paper delivered at a 1978 brazilian conference discussing the failure of
public libraries to become an accepted community institution. considers their
actual state at present' housed in substandard buildings, under-resourced,
staffed by untrained personnel, and used mainly by students. the imported
model of the public library serving the needs of all the community is
inappropriate to the social reality in brazil, where social structure is based
on class division. statistics are presented to show the extent of potential
demand, but despite recent expansion of services, and the growth of
publishing, the population of non-users remains constant, and reading
continues to be an elite leisure activity. the initiation of a cultural policy
to break the chains of social dependence and develop plans for society as a
whole is advocated.

when the law was passed, it was generally understood that the government would
finance 75% of public library budgets. the situation over the past several
years has been that an ever-growing percentage of the budget is covered by
local authorities. this has not only brought about a deterioration of public
library services, but may lead to a situation in which the libraries section
of the ministry of education and culture will be unable to enforce the high
standards it has set, since it will not have the necessary funds to pass on to
local authorities. documents the actions and efforts of the committee on the
full implementation of the public libraries law since its formation in june

a talk given at a course on leadership-public libraries at the local
authorities' high school, nov 81. discusses politicians' expectations of the
library and its staff. cooperation between local politicians and librarians is
often hampered by the librarians' preference for centrally imposed norms
instead of adaptation to local needs. but imposition of obligations takes away
spontaneity. objects to self-appointed moralists guiding the people's cultural
needs in a certain ideological direction. comprehensiveness, one of the
library objectives, cannot be on the basis of a particular book, which must
necessarily present a particular viewpoint, but must be an overall guideline.
the library law, like modern education and social laws, should specify an
obligation to development planning in the individual authority, not lay down
external structural norms without regard to local conditions. the leading
librarian and the leading head teacher must have equal  say on the cultural
committee to secure libraries' independence from an administrative leader from
the education service. libraries must nourish the qualified doubt and supply
the means for constructive criticism of expert knowledge necessary in the
democratic decision making process. libraries and local politicians must
cooperate in keeping art and culture independent of political and commercial
influence.

the hungarian centre for library science and methodology conducted an

departmentalised public libraries. on the basis of the replies received, the
following conclusions were made' under 3,000 sq.m. basic area and 300,000
volumes it is not worthwhile establishing full subject departments; moving to
a new building generally encourages the establishment of subject departments;
the majority of libraries develop the new structure not in 1 step but
gradually; subjective standpoints prevail often in the demarcation of subject
departments; when selecting special staff those with library qualifications
have the advantage over specialists who are not librarians.

management-by-objectives is suggested as a means to justify the existence of
an industrial library and information service. the prerequisites are that the
industrial librarian must grasp the special circumstances under which a
service function operates in industry as well as the attitudes towards these
functions. he must also acquaint himself with the objectives of the
organisation he serves and arrange his services to make a definable
contribution towards the achievement of these organisational objectives. the
objectives of the different departments must be used as premises for
determining where the library and information function should operate and how
its services should be presented. the information service (which consists of 3
sections, a library, translation bureau and information dissemination) of the
south african iron and steel industrial corporation (iscor) is used as a
working example. the use of mbo by isc or is briefly discussed and the
objectives of iscor and its general manager are mentioned. from these
objectives areas of responsibility are derived and identified in the form of
the different iscor departments.

lecture given to a meeting of members of parliament in berlin. germans are
proud of their right to the free expression of opinion in speech and in
writing, yet this very freedom can cause confusion. since information can be
unscrupulously manipulated a responsible attitude must be maintained.
inter-library cooperation for stock purchase and loans is essential to keep
costs down. libraries often rank low in lists of cultural priorities owing to
a lack of information about their problems and a lack of public interest;
market economy criteria cannot be applied to them. the provision of
information and literature must be planned rationally. many libraries have had
to accept cuts in their budgets although the prices of books and periodicals
have risen; cooperation between libraries and the book trade must be improved.

for various reasons it is becoming more and more difficult for public
libraries to obtain sufficient funds from their authorities, in competition
with other more essential services. free public libraries originated in the uk
during the middle of the last century, their main function being the uplifting
of the uneducated. today public libraries mainly concentrate on the supplying
of light reading matter, especially novels, of which the majority are, from a
literary point of view, of a dubious nature. the arguments used during the
last century to defend the principle of free services are no longer valid
today. the functions of the modern public library are neither fully part of
the world of education nor the world of recreation, with the result that its
image to the outside world is obscure. considers that, although continued
financing of public library services by the south african government is
necessary, no valid objection can be found to charg e users for those services
which are not essential for the aims which the public library pursues.

the views that various members of a south african community may have on the

resident non-ratepayers and non-resident library members, and looks at the
justification for a free library service to each group. he concludes that the
1st group is the only one who can justifiably be given a free public library
service by a local authority.

there is still disagreement over whether mobile or stationary libraries
provide the best service for rural areas with populations under 5,000. mobile
libraries permit flexible organisation and can come close to users' homes;
they are operated by professional staff who bring a large and varied book
stock supplemented by central reserves. since they are only in 1 place for a
short time, however, they cannot easily become cultural centres. small
stationary branch libraries in rural areas have small, restricted stocks and
are rarely served by professional staff. a comparison of initial and running
costs for mobile and small stationary branch libraries in middle franconia
reveals that mobile library provision is the cheaper method and a comparison
of performances, that it is the more efficient.

having to bear an increasing level of taxation for libraries and other
services. describes how problems have been overcome in 2 authorities' in
sutton where revenue-raising activities such as video games have been
introduced; and in brent, where the community based library service, because
of its major commitment to outreach and community based programmes has been
treated more favourably than other departments. notes the response of the

the text of a talk given to a conference on libraries in the icy wind of
cultural policy, held in jarfalla, may 81. in order to influence cultural
policy the cultural producers must inform themselves of the whole sphere of
local politics. local authorities have no legal obligation to provide cultural
activities and legislation laying down minimum standards for such activities,
as in finland, should be enacted. after the boom in the 60s and 70s, the local
authorities have to make cuts; as they cannot reduce previous capital
investment they cut current expenditure on cultural activities such as schools
and libraries, although money seems always available for sport, bureaucracy
and data technology. the real power of decision-making lies not with the
cultural, but with the executive committee, who is responsible for budgeting.
cultural consumers should be as politically active as the pressure groups for
sport and try to influence local politicians,  if a catastrophe for culture is
to be averted.

library cooperatives will evolve more into automated library networks which
are generally more cost-effective, less labour-intensive, and provide more and

libraries have a significant commitment with funds from their local libraries'
operating budgets and which view the services as an integral part of their
essential operations. cost-effective networks are characterised by greater
competition, less state and federal control, and more research and

qualifications and personal characteristics required of women in
librarianship, as well as their part in library associations. women first
became accepted in librarianship when there were insufficient numbers of men
available. the women, mostly from the middle class, rushed into a profession
which did not detract from social prestige. stereotyped ideas concerning
female qualities made their entrance into the profession easier' accuracy,
industry, self-denial and subordination on the one hand; social sensitivity,
motherly feeling and insight into people's nature on the other. the growing
number of women in librarianship made an organ for the representation of their
interests desirable. the 'vereinigung bibliotekarisch arbeitender frauen',
founded in 1907, made efforts to improve payment, inform interested people
about the profession and about ed ucation for librarianship, and provided an
employment agency. the association was dissolved into the 'reichsverband

less per week. there is need for a massive library building programme, or,
more realistically, cooperation with similarly placed organisations. already
18% of public libraries share premises with school libraries, and 20% with
offices etc. multi-purpose planning must recognise the needs of all potential
users and involve them in discussions. the library is traditionally used for
activities such as meetings and concerts. other possibilities include
cooperation with nursery schools, which have short opening hours in sparsely
populated communities, or welfare services, which need central premises.

5-county metropolitan area of columbus, ohio, commissioned by the great traib
broadcasting company to gain a better understanding of its radio audience. the
data, analysed by oclc, suggests an approach to library use promotion that
expressively demonstrates how library services can fit into preexisting needs
and interests. the public should be shown how library services can help to
solve real life problems. the life style variables can help pinpoint these
problems and suggest promotional themes and ideas.

2 library staff members accompanied a class of 14-year olds and their teachers
from a kassel comprehensive school on a holiday trip to sylt. the library
staff took with them about 140 books on games, modelling, the identification
of sea creatures and some children's fiction. every evening the children and
teachers used these books as a complement to the day's activities. as a result
the library staff developed close contact with some teachers and pupils who
had hitherto been seen only rarely in the library. some of these children who
had tended to misbehave in the school library were shown to better advantage
in the holiday situation. story sessions were also organised and were received
enthusiastically, even by children who had previously shown little interest in
literature.

the starting point for the formulation of a bibliographic system model is the
interaction between bibliographic services and its user categories; this takes
into account users' bibliographic requirements, and must also anticipate them
and stimulate them in agreement with both individual and society's needs. very
important is the cooperation between individual bibliographic information
services which should be integrated into a wider bibliographic system. a study
of the actual state of affairs in district libraries showed, however, some
shortcomings.

examines the profession of information brokerage through a look at types of
services provided, and through a discussion of major issues, including that of
user fees. the types of information broker and free-lance librarian services
are identified' (1) non-profit reference and research services administered by
public libraries and educational institutions' (2) large for-profit reference
organisations which provide a variety of information services, such as the
gathering, organisation, packaging, and dissemination of information' (3)
major for-profit businesses which produce such information products as indexes
and current awareness packages' and (4) services provided by the individual
free-lance librarian. current developments in each of these categories are
traced with reference to representative information consulting services and
organisations. issues viewed as holding major importance in this profession
include  the ethics of user fees and consequent ramifications on development
of pay libraries, the attitude of some librarians toward professional support
for the new breed of information worker, and the concept of professionalism as
it pertains to free-lance librarians. report not available from ntis.

reference, the catalogue being divided into 2 files, 1 for time-consuming
queries and 1 for brief literature references and miscellaneous information
often required; topics most in demand should be ascertained and every topic
put into a classified list which can then be used for stock expansion; and a

in modern society where people wish to participate in the decision-making
process it is essential that the public have access through libraries to
information on all matters affecting their lives. for this purpose collections
of material relating to matters of current, social concern should be formed in
local libraries. however, material of this nature is often difficult to obtain
and to organise. in addition, since the useful life of such material is often
short, the librarian must ensure through careful publicity that the collection
is used as heavily as possible. in the netherlands the nederlands bibliotheek
en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature) plans to
organise a meeting in 1982 for librarians to discuss the organisation and
exploitation of such collections in public libraries.

collection includes material on environmental planning, minutes of local
council meetings, and the addresses and services of local organisations.
exhibitions are held on topics of current interest and a large part of the

the large public library, such as the johannesburg public library, south
africa, that is situated in an area with many special libraries, can provide
an information service to the general public who are without access to the
special libraries. such a library can often provide reference material which
is not specialised enough for the special library while not popular enough for
the smaller public library. at least some information sources on a very wide
range of subjects are required. the library staff cannot be experts on all
these fields. they consequently refer users to information sources and expect
users to do their own searching. users often fall in the small business
category and are without libraries of their own. the information they need may
sometimes not be available in a form applicable to the south african
situation. the johannesburg public library serves as a depository for the
journals received by many scientific a nd technical societies in johannesburg,
and in some cases the library manages and maintains the library of a society
within the jpl building. rendering information services is one way to show
that the library is using public money to good advantage.

institutes relevant to this model listed. the proposed model demonstrates how
to establish the characteristics of both internal and external users; the
nature of the information needs of researchers, technicians, and marketers;
and the information services to be offered, with particular reference to
abstracting and question and answer services. by effecting continuous

of microbiology in regard to patents. only 3 of the services-2chemical
abstracts, microbiology abstracts, section +a, 1and 2food science and
technology abstracts1-cover patents at all. the 3 services were assessed in
terms of the information they provide about patents and in terms of their
performance in retrieving patents taken from a master list of patents on
genetic engineering and vitamin d, obtained by searches on 2world patents
index. 1timeliness of the services was also assessed. it was found that none
of the standard abstracting services in the field cover patents satisfactorily
and they are slow in picking up patents. the research demonstrates that by
scanning just japanese, u.s.s.r. u.s., and u.k. patents, both timely and

needs of the clinical team by attending ward rounds and meetings, to meet
these needs immediately by providing selected documents in response to patient
care queries, to build multidisciplinary document collections relating to
specific patient care problems, and to make these available to other hospitals
in the district. they aimed also to compile various publications based on the
document collections and to emphasise the importance of teaching literature
searching techniques particularly to clinical students and newly qualified
doctors. discusses why not all these aims could be fulfilled and describes

the recognition by librarians of the growing importance of evaluating
library-use instruction is steadily increasing, as evidenced by reports in the
literature. however, much work has yet to be done which uses sophisticated
evaluation techniques. reports the follow-up of an earlier study by examining
the long-term retention of library-use skills. through use of pretesting and
posttesting, control and experimental groups, aggregate and individual
comparisons, multiple regression, and other techniques, concludes that
long-term possession of library-use skills is more highly related to
library-use instruction than to either inherent intellectual ability or
academic diligence. in addition, discusses the appropriateness of quantitative
and qualitative methods of evaluation and caution against taking for granted
the effective use of evaluation.

bibliographic access to individual titles in microform collections is a
problem. neither the library of congress nor most micropublishers fully
analyse these collections. individual libraries cannot afford to do so either.
but without author and title access, these collections are not very useful.
full analytics for microform collections have been called for but no effort
yet has been successful. suggests that libraries abandon full cataloguing in
favour of indexing, using the information provided by micropublishers. while a
national index to the contents of microform collections would be best, an
alternative for local libraries would be to create their own com index.

in may 78 the provincial central library of limburg in the netherlands created
a current and social affairs information service for public libraries in the
region. at the central library a team of 2 staff scan 5 national and all local
newspapers together with a number of journals of local interest for articles
and information relating to limburg. the information extracted from these
sources is classified into 75 subject fields covering the social, cultural and
political life of the province, and at present 57 libraries subscribe to this
service. in the naarden-bussum central public library in the netherlands a
similar service was formed in oct 79 relating to employment and training
opportunities. due to lack of funds the service is organised by an unpaid,

a 6-month experimental sdi service was undertaken at the university of natal
library, pietermaritzburg south africa, as part of a plan to make subject
librarians more service orientated, and in the knowledge that research time
for academics was at a premium. a methodology was devised and 21 lecturers
from across the academic spectrum submitted 27 profiles. references were
supplied from journals and monographs and from abstracting tools where the
library had poor literature coverage. at the end of the 6 months, feedback
revealed that 93% of the references assessed (82%) were relevant or apparently
relevant, showing that bibliographic rather than terminological skills were
the salient factor. academic response was unanimously in favour of a
continuation of the service, while a few respondents wanted minor
improvements. the subject librarians found that the service increased job
satisfaction and allowed them to look more critically at library stock. in
terms of  time and financial cost the sdi service was easily absorbed into the
existing work structure of the library. it was found to be particularly
relevant to interdisciplinary research, and it relied upon a well-developed
subject librarian structure. its success, however, depended on an active
campaign by librarians directed at potential participants.

reference service is defined as a direct interaction between the user and the

the muzei-zapovednik a.s. pushkina (a.s. pushkin museum-preserve) is a
literary mecca in june on pushkin's name-day. poems are read and songs
performed in his honour. librarians should help readers to appreciate
pushkin's poetry. the regional library could compile a work on pushkin based
on the museum's visitors' books, dating from 1899. readers could be encouraged
to describe how they discovered pushkin. pushkin literary evenings should
treat only one of his works and adapt to the audience's age group. for these,
librarians could study variants of his poems, the social life and popular
culture of his time. the pushkinogorets regional library should become a
repository of pushkin area legends. the museum strives to encourage a lively

describes the efforts of halmstad public library to promote poetry. swedish
public libraries acquire very little poetry, and poetry evenings are an
exception. poetry cafe ostergard began in autumn 80 with evening gatherings
held in halmstad's branch library in ostergard school. the aim was not to
replace halmstad central library's author evenings, but to complement them
with activities in a branch library. new forms were sought which involved the
participants in active listening and conversation. a cafe atmosphere with
coffee and cakes was created. many of the poets lived locally. the library
prints posters and advertises in the local press and radio prior to each
evening and prepares free folders with poems and introductions to the poets.
emphasises that there must be continuity through regular activities and that
more personal contact to promote the evenings and more participation by
amateur poets are needed if the cafe is to cont inue.

since 1977, the librarians' union has stressed that automation in libraries
should begin with bibliographic systems. biblioteksdata has replied that their
development plans agree with this priority, but adds that local libraries must
be free to decide which automation system to use. fears that biblioteksdata,
in effect, is giving priority to automation of administrative tasks, such as
issues and acquisitions, although the union has argued the need for terminal
access for libraries to the bibliographic data base. provision of such access
has been held up by the fact that the question of the best subject search
system has not yet been solved. meantime, however, attempts should be made to
provide terminal access with free text searching, similar searching on
microform, and expansion of bibliographic entries with subject words. argues
that the limited resources should be concentrated on the most important area'
services.

a statements by biblioteksdata on its past achievement and future plans. since
1974, the library centre has been building up a data base of now 280,000
titles, invaluable for libraries in their stock registration. the experience
from the automation of olstykke library will also benefit the future system.
specifications for registration of materials, issue control and catalogues
have been developed. a project consisting of modules which libraries can
accept gradually has now been developed. the project is dependent on' computer
registration of libraries' stock, decentralised input of data in own
terminals, standardisation, gradual introduction of modules as they become
ready, and locally determined selection of modules. the cataloguing module
will be ready at the end of 1982, the issue and acquisitions modules during
1983. the beta module makes it possible to register a library's holdings of
titles already in the library centre base. suppliers of hardware are to  be
chosen during spring 82; running costs can, therefore, not be calculated yet.

identification for each of the constituents following a tagging scheme. a
model format for the bibliographic description of simple monographs is

several agencies that were formerly satisfied by single conversions from
another format are beginning to require data from multiple agencies. either
multiple conversions must be written or a switch to unimarc could take place.
the cost savings with unimarc are obvious. multiple conversions programmes
represent a high initial investment and a tremendous problem in keeping up
with all of the changes to necessarily dynamic national formats. the
introduction of aacr2 and resultant national format changes are at this time
causing several agencies to rewrite conversion programmes. a major obstacle to
a truly international unimarc exchange is that the change takes a joint
commitment since an agency's ability to receive unimarc records is useless if
the sending agency cannot send them. ifla and its members need to undertake a
major effort to bring a unimarc programme into service.

predict the issues which will be received by the various participating

library reflect the library's 2 main functions, that of the swedish national
library and stockholm's central library in the fields of humanities and social
sciences. material acquired in keeping with the 1st function (suecana
extranea) is divided into 4 sections-foreign translations of swedish writers'
works, works in swedish published abroad, works on sweden and works of swedish
nationals published abroad. exchanges of publications with libraries in other

in slovak public libraries 3 modes of acquisitions are practised at present'
the individual one, in which every library tries to satisfy its users' needs

libraries in the district with literature; total centralisation of
acquisition, practised by 17 district libraries. the latter is the most
rational means of acquisition on condition that the literature is processed in
1 centre and that a collective catalogue is kept. each central library must
formulate its acquisition policy taking into consideration the requirements of
readers/users of the individual libraries.

in the 1976-80 guidelines on libraries in east germany, long-term stock
planning was advocated on a basis of differential values for stock items per
inhabitant, so that stocks can be acquired which allow for social demands.
functional equipping of different types of library is necessary to facilitate
regional purchasing scheme development. the stock guideline for 1981-85
emphasises stock expansion and the purchase of replacement copies; other
guidelines cover the expansion of audio-visual media services, new rules on
the purchase of periodicals and newspapers and extra provision of books in
holiday resorts. the latest guidelines should remove unjustifiable differences
in stock standards.

in 1975 the number of stock items per inhabitant in leipzig libraries was
slightly below the national average, so plans for 1976-80 emphasised stock
expansion. variable provision standards were calculated for central and branch
libraries. statistical analysis of results for this period shows a large stock
budget, so that in several areas the required levels of stock provision were
reached or even exceeded. only some of the most densely populated areas fell
below the requisite standards. other aims for 1976-80 were the expansion and
qualitative improvement of stocks in the central library and the raising of
periodical subscription charges. particular difficulty was experienced with
stocks for rural libraries, especially for part-time branch libraries;
guidelines for 1981-85 aim to improve this aspect of the service.

some prior cataloguing could be done. a plan for distribution of the material
according to subject to the 7 units which constitute the university library
was drawn up. after 2 years some publishers are still not aware of their duty
to deliver, and routines for claiming have had to be developed. the monograph
copies received are intended as regional copies for distribution to other
institutions within the region, or copies for use within the university; a
policy of withdrawal was developed, as no archival duty exists. problems were
caused by the number and late delivery of periodicals. handling of leaflets
and other ephemera has proved most complicated and time consuming, and this
material remains uncatalogued. the question of its future needs urgently to be

the growth of the hungarian institute of public health's objectives and
research team, the lack of space and the rise in journal prices induced the
librarians to examine the usage of journals. they wished to establish journals
which need not be subscribed to any longer; journals which could be placed in
remote storage; and journals which readers regularly require but which are not
available in the library. data were collected from 1 nov 77 -30 apr 78. as a
result of the investigation it can be laid down that the library can comply,
from its own stock, with a large part of readers' demands for journals. the
smaller part (29%) of the stock fulfils 77% of demands, the larger proportion
is little used. the number of journals not used at all is small. journals used
less will be put in distant stacks; current journals and often used volumes

discusses some steps which us librarians are taking to try and solve the
problem of the rapid deterioration of graphic materials. argues that
librarianship education during the last decade has been emphasising services,
administration, advanced technologies and nonprint media, and paid little
attention to the transmission of ideas, and the causes which lead to the
disappearance, preservation, and reinterpretation of these ideas. urges
librarians to share and value a sense of history, which is seen as the one and
most important unifying element which will decide the fate of their graphic
records.

report of a study carried out in a brazilian research library, to establish
the rate of user satisfaction and analyse the reasons for failures. the
importance of quantitative studies of user satisfaction is discussed with
reference to a major series of investigations in brazilian university
libraries, which generated this study. loan request procedures and user
registration documentation are described to explain the methods used to
collect data. the initial hypotheses, based on a review of the literature, are
presented and details given of the methodology used. the formulae applied to
analyse the data are explained and calculations of results presented in full,
showing satisfaction rates. further analysis of request failures with
reference to publication data and user information showed both inadequacies in
the collection and inaccuracies in bibliographical information supplied by
users.

identifying and representing the content of a document is one of the main
concerns of information retrieval systems. discusses the attributes of all the
items in the data base. if the attributes are not totally independent or
highly correlated, then combining them in a certain way may increase
effectiveness. justification for this comes from the users' information
seeking behaviour' users employ index terms, authors' names, citations and
other attributes. formulates a model to cover this hypothesis.

africana materials are notoriously difficult to catalogue. the number of
publications about and from africa has increased rapidly in the last 2
decades, proportionately increasing the number of problem books. although much
has been published about the problems of cataloguing africana, very little
actually aids the cataloguer in finding answers to the practical questions
raised by these materials. answers are found in scattered and sometimes
obscure publications. there has long been a need for a guide to these sources
of information. here is such a guide, compiled with the needs of both the
generalist and specialist cataloguer in mind.

possible increased. detailed descriptions of stocks, mainly german and latin
material, and progress in cataloguing are included for' the bavarian state

a collection of manuscript fragments has been housed in the bavarian state
library since the beginning of the 19th century. in the 1860s an index was
made by friedrich kein, using a scientific arrangement clearly separating the
classical from the mediaeval. in 1977 a new classification of the latin
fragments was created to allow more detailed analysis of each document and an
index compiled which at present contains 2,810 items. the range of signature
numbers was extended, a concordance being provided to facilitate the recovery
of texts cited under the old system. indexes of authors, anonyma, places of
origin, signatures, miniatures and initials are included. the index may be
made into a printed catalogue.

taking the cataloguing of audio-visual materials using practices evolved for
printed documents as a starting point, considers the restrictions imposed on
research when information retrieval can only be effected through the
restricted approaches permitted by standard reductive cataloguing codes.
attempts to apply conventional cataloguing procedures to audio-visual material
require the transcription of images and sounds into textual equivalents, for
integration with the existing collection of written documents. searching by
purely visual or audio qualities is impossible. equally, written documents can
only be accessed by a limited number of established approaches. reference is
made to recent published discussion of problems in audio-visual cataloguing
and strategies to solve them.

through the dissolution of the monasteries in 1803, bavarian libraries
acquired many music manuscripts, mainly of choral and instrumental works from
about 1750 onwards. since 1958 renewed efforts at cataloguing have been made,
with help, since 1964, from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (german
research association) and the bavarian state library. since 1971 3 catalogue
sections have been published and others are in course of preparation. the
catalogues are important since this type of music is rarely found in public
collections; brief biographies of little-known composers are included. the
collection also includes early works by well-known composers such as mozart
and michael haydn. 3 collections owned by noble families and some material
belonging to the nation are also recorded. the 6 volumes already published of
the 2catalogue of bavarian music collections1 are described.

cataloguing of music manuscripts in franconia was begun in 1977 by the
wurzburg university. the catalogue provides lists of locations in roman
catholic and evangelical parish churches. most of the 1,550 roman catholic
items are settings of the mass; there is little instrumental music apart from
some 19th century organ pieces. the 600 manuscripts from evangelical churches
are mostly in the rossach collection, dating from the middle of the 18th
century. many compositions are by well-known composers from outside franconia
of the 18th and 19th centuries. collections owned by noble families contain
mostly secular songs, piano and chamber music. most of the manuscripts are in
good condition; a few suffering from damp required laboratory treatment. the
printed music documented at the same time was mostly from the 19th century.

work of the national centres. it publishes isds register and bulletin. in 1981
the register contained about 120,000 items. the centre cooperates with other
international organisations. the national centres are responsible for
cataloguing serials for isds and maintaining data bases for national serial
publications. there are also some area centres, e.g. in moscow, which covers
the ussr, hungary, bulgaria, east germany, czechoslovakia, cuba, and mongolia.

the development of a central title catalogue free of redundancies, and in
which titles with multiple locational references occur only once, is possible
within a cooperative cataloguing network, where the work load is distributed
only through standardisation of the entry form. to achieve this, the detection
and prevention of multiple references is especially important. describes the
current status of network cataloguing in west germany, the
monograph-cataloguing networks in north rhine westphalia, bavaria, and oclc.
the more intensive investigation of these problems which thereby become
apparent, regarding the establishment of uniform title entries, takes into
account the technical aspects of data processing, specific library aspects,
and organisational problems. thus can a realistic appraisal of the
possibilities of using data processing in libraries be achieved.

the reading libraries were forerunners of the modern public library; they were
founded in the 18th century, at the time of the enlightenment, as
profit-making institutions by middle-class citizens for educational and
recreational purposes. the catalogue of 1 such library, die arnoldsche
bibliothek in budissen, 1799-1806, is 1 of the rare books in the public
library of potsdam. comprising a main volume and 13 supplements, it lists
7,000 titles in accession order. the library stocked mainly fiction from
germany and abroad, of which some works have now become classics. the fiction
stock also reflected the contemporary enthusiasm for tales about mediaeval
chivalry and the supernatural. there were also about 400 dramatic works and
100 on travel and contemporary history.

since 1945 69 volumes of manuscript catalogues have been published in west
germany, many of them funded by the german research society. 236 individual
reviews of the manuscript catalogues appeared in 61 journals. these were local
and regional journals, national and international journals and specialist
subject journals. the majority of the reviews were in german; there was little
response from other countries except france. the most popular forms of review
was a report with an evaluation or short notes. the manuscript catalogue
reviews are of interest to 4 main groups' the author, the libraries
(especially the manuscript departments), the german research society with

a brief discussion of aacr2 opens the article. the rules are the result of a
desire for true international uniformity, though they are still
'anglo-american' in their preference of english forms. aacr2 gives equal
status to book and non-book materials. there is much less stress on
'authorship' and more on 'responsibility'. the uniform structure of all
chapters is described. describes important changes-as compared to aacr1-in
rules for descriptive cataloguing and headings. some reservations are made
about headings for jewish religious works. the decision by lc to carry out
'desuperimposition' and to close its catalogue is noted, and its effect on us
libraries discussed. israeli cataloguing has traditionally followed us
practice, and israeli libraries will adopt aacr2 sooner or later to avail
themselves of foreign cataloguing and to enable israeli cataloguing to become
part of the international network of bibliographic control. y et, it is not
imperative to adopt aacr2 immediately. it is desirable to wait and see how us
libraries accustom themselves to the changes and to see how lc implements and
interprets the rules. meanwhile it is suggested that all options in aacr2 be
checked, and a uniform israeli practice be adopted. it is also desirable that
the feasibility of adopting aacr2 at the highest level of description by
2kiryath sepher1, the israel national bibliography, be checked.

the distinction between knowledge classifications and bibliographic
classifications has been justified by the multi-dimensional character of
knowledge and the uni-dimensional character of bibliographic classification.
semantic catalogues exist in a logical state of probability not only because
of the temporal distance between their preparation and consultation, but
because they can never be verified, except after a great time lag. the problem
is always the search for formulae for references providing the greatest
guarantee of intercommunication between subjects. there is a vital need to
define theoretically and logically the 'subject' in relation to the 'object'.

since 1970, work has been in progress to gradually introduce the soviet
classification scheme (referred to as bbk) into all types of libraries in
bulgaria. the major responsibility for achieving this target has been that of
the cyril and methodius national library in sofia supported by the national
committee for culture and other bodies. the national library's staff have been
principally involved in translating and editing the unabridged
30-volume-bbk-version which has been published from 1973-81. the large
scientific libraries will be catered for with this edition. public libraries,
libraries in schools and others will be provided with abridged versions
adapted for their special needs. various guide books, either translated from
russian or written by bulgarian experts, will assist librarians to apply the
bbk in the most effective way. an itemised account for introducing the bbk is

to serve the needs of library patrons using the shelf arrangement to retrieve
scores for performance purposes. the basis of the comparison presented here is
a random sample of 400 chamber-music scores chosen from the 2british catalogue
of music1. each classification is analysed for its strengths and weaknesses in
terms of its ability to meet the needs of performers, and the classifications
are then compared using standard statistical methods. concludes with a

on-line information service in public libraries, seeing them in action, and
discussing related aspects such as fees. distinguishes between different forms
of information' facts; and information about information, such as particular
books or subjects. to handle the stream of information, libraries need new
technology. only if information is electronically registered can all
information be accessible on-line to everyone. problems then arise of actually
obtaining the information and selecting the amount needed. standardisation of
cataloguing and systems is needed. the holdings of danish libraries should be

report of the conference on on-line information retrieval in public libraries
held in banbury, 8-10 sept 81. the british library devotes *6150,000 of its
annual budget to research into aspects of public librarianship. since 1978 the
british library has sponsored a number of projects concerned with on-line
information services in public libraries, including the biros and 'guidelines'
projects. the biros (bibliographic information retrieval online service)
project involved the development by staff of manchester polytechnic of an
on-line information retrieval system for use in lancashire county library,
whilst the 'guidelines' project studied the use of on-line systems in public
libraries. the results of the 'guidelines' project showed that these services
were used largely by businessmen and college and university teachers. the
project was unable to provid e a solution to the question of charging for such
services in public libraries.

association annual conference. the penninsular library system's community
information program is based on a public library cooperative system in san

describes the background and activities of the danish diane centre, opened in
june 81. the commission of the eec had in 1972 decided to set up a european
data transmission network, euronet, operated by the national telecommunication
services, in order to support a european information industry in the face of
us competition. the 36 hosts, organisations and private service bureaux, which
offer access to information in the form of 271 different data bases and data
banks, are gathered under the network diane. distinguishes between data bases,
usually storing bibliographic data, and data banks, mostly with instantly
usable data. full text bases and registers of activities and addresses are
also gaining in importance. to spread the knowledge of euronet-diane's
information services, advisory centres are set up in the individual countries,
viz. the danish diane centre. the centre hopes to advise on all data bases and
data banks wh ich can be used in denmark, including us, european and
scandinavian networks. the centre aims to advise on the optimal use of on-line
information services through direct assistance to individuals, courses and
publications.

explains the involvement of the danish library association (danmarks
biblioteksforening (db)) in the danish teleadministration's planned teledata
experiment, due to run for 2 years from jan 82. 200 tv sets will be placed
with selected users, 25 of whom will be public institutions and 10 of these
libraries. about 60 organisations will provide information and db will
coordinate the information supplied to the teledata base. db was able to argue
successfully against fees for the use of the teledata during the experimental
period. by being involved in the development of information technology from
the start, db is better able to influence it. this also explains why db is a
member of danmedia, has helped to set up a technology committee and is
represented in the media commission. a project aimed at evaluation of the
teledata medium from a library viewpoint is being developed by the library
inspectorate and d b. includes a bibliography of articles on information
technology published in 2bogens verden1 since 1979.

in aug 80 60 public libraries in the netherlands began a 12-month
investigation of the possible uses of viewdata in public libraries. the
results of the investigation are currently being studied by a working party
set up by the nederlands bibliotheek en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for
libraries and literature). the current cost of the system varies from *6700 to
*62,000 depending on the equipment chosen, plus the cost of telephone charges,
subscription to viewdata (*62 per month) and the cost of computer time. at
present viewdata appears to have little use in public libraries. however, the
experiment has proved valuable in acquainting library staff and readers with
the operation of electronic information systems.

questions the traditional assumption that it is less expensive to print search
results off-line than to print them on-line. describes a simple formula to
determine on-line print costs for comparison with off-line charges for 2 major
data base vendors (lockheed and sdc). the equation permits the calculation of
the maximum citation length at which off-line printing becomes economic.
concludes that with local printing at 1200 baud, there is very little
advantage to printing off-line.

this method is based on text structure analysis and uses a relatively small
dictionary. the dictionary is based on knowledge of scientific and
technological concepts and on some lexical knowledge. text analysis is used to
select significant phrases as substantial and semantic information carriers of
the contents of the abstract. results of an experiment on 5 sets of documents
indicate that significant phrases are effectively extracted within a
satisfactory processing time.

the title expressed by a noun phrase or clause is converted to a
function-expression by parsing. for retrieval with a reasonable recall rate as
well as a high precision rate, the function-expression is transformed to a
predicate-governor form and then normalised to a standard form. various items
are taken from this and recorded in a hierarchical, tree-like inverted file.
to keep recall at a reasonable rate, several retrieval stages are implemented
based on the key-term and case-label matching. retrieval is controlled by the
preciseness of the specification of case-labels for each key-term.

mulheim an der ruhr has had a tripartite library since 1977, total stocks of
276,740 items serving a population of 181,522. the 'immediate concern area',
or forothek, comprises 9,100 uncatalogued volumes of a popular nature arranged
informally in broad subject groups, with such fiction categories as thrillers
and such non-fiction categories as books for parents, books on animals and
consumer information. in mar 80 a survey of readers' opinions on the forothek
was carried out; information from 500 questionnaires is analysed in detail.
most people liked the forothek; it helped many readers to use the main library
more easily and to discover fresh interests.

describes an experiment with a department common to adults and children in the
new library in emmaboda, opened in autumn 80. the shape of the new library
made it difficult to divide it into departments and the possibility of savings
in acquisition of material suitable for both adults and children, or for young
people on the borderline of adulthood persuaded the library to try to
integrate the material. the library is divided into fiction and non-fiction,
with non-fiction books for children placed after those for adults on the same
shelf; adult fiction and children's fiction have their own shelves, but in the
same place in the hall. an area in connection with the issue desk contains
periodicals and picture books with seating for all ages, including headphones
for children. after a year the experience has proved entirely positive.

.I 4922
.W
criticises the public library policy of dividing children's books according to
age level as contrary to the reader's right to select material appropriate to
his own abilities. draws on recent studies by brazilian researchers to
establish that fluency in reading is a skill acquired progressively at an
individual rate determined both by an increase in mechanical facility and the
process of maturing. thus the reader's age does not necessarily correspond to
his reading capacity, and artificial divisions imposed by libraries
effectively prevent access to suitable material. the economic and social
advantages of permitting free choice of books are discussed in relation to
popularising libraries and maximising use of their resources.

concluded that the postal service should continue to develop electronic mail
services insofar as they enhance present physical delivery of messages.
electronic mail services should be managed by an independent unit within the
postal service, and continued market research will be needed to determine
customer needs. planning for the new services should be done in partnership
with labour representatives, and the security of electronic mail against

describes the text telephone installed in landskrona public library early in
1981 for the use of the deaf and speech impaired. it consists of 3 units' an
ordinary telephone, a keyboard used to type the text, and a screen monitor,
which receives and transmits the text. the handicapped person needs also a
signal relay, which transforms the audible telephone signals to visual
signals, and he must be able to type as the keyboard is that of a standard
typewriter. disabled people can contact others with similar equipment, but
contact to an ordinary telephone requires a transformer. the telephone
directory has special markings for text telephones. expansion of the service,
which provides an opportunity to reach new and isolated groups, has been
limited by lack of finance.

statistics for the last 10 years in east germany reflect the success achieved
by the publishing industry in stimulating public interest in reading and in
trying to satisfy readers' needs. the importance of providing the widest
possible range of material on different subjects and in different languages is
recognised. foreign material most in demand is that from the ussr, followed by
works from other communist countries and from the third world. naturally a
wide range of contemporary domestic literature is also available. in 1980,
library stocks totalled 80 million items and the booktrade turnover has
increased by 32% during the last 5 years. close links have been developed
between authors, publishers and the public. more research into reading habits

describes the background to a campaign to reach more readers with quality
literature initiated by the cultural council. in a memorandum of feb 81 it was

which new methods should be used to stimulate interest in reading and improve
the distribution of books, and the effects of the methods evaluated; and a
national information campaign with the object of giving information about
books, and stimulate interest in the regional project. contact with various
organisations was made, above all the public library commission. in the
regional project the emphasis was to be on local involvement. the project,
called the dala project, is to start in the autumn 81 in the kopparberg region
and has 4 cornerstones' schools, public libraries, study circles and mass
media. the project should lead to cooperation and better use of resources, but
also to suggestions for models for future local library  services and for the
opinion forming role of the cultural council.

very few people either only buy their books or only obtain them from a library
and many people buy books as often as they borrow them. library users who
borrow few books buy a larger proportion of their books than library users who
borrow many books. however, whereas over 1/2 the population of germany buy
books, only about 1/4 use public libraries. investigations have revealed that
important influences on behaviour regarding the use of books include the home
background, school and general social environment. an individual's sense of
values also plays its part, often influenced by the media and communication
possibilities. perhaps the main influence is the social learning process and
an individual's own attitude towards it. there are still numerous unexplored
possibilities for influencing children and adults in their use of books.

a reading campaign was carried out in class 3b of islev school in rodovre,
denmark, in which the pupils aimed to read at home a total of 200 books from
the school library in 9 weeks. the readers were given a time in which to read
each book and used a form to report on the content, illustrations and ease of
reading. these comments were read to the class each week. the 1st batch of
books was chosen by the 2 teachers concerned, the next by teachers and pupils
together in the library, and the last mainly by the pupils themselves. if no
book attracted a child, he or she could chose 1 from the library with help
from the librarian. a 'book thermometer' in the classroom showed progress in
reading the 200 books. an exhibition on the project was mounted in the library
and a tape was made of some of the readers' opinions. the campaign stimulated
interest in reading and in borrowing books from the school library and some
children who had never read a book before now did so, sometimes as a result of
the recorded comments. the aim was fulfilled, all 200 books being read during
the 9-week period.

in terms of published literature russian language material is 2nd only to
english language production. however, there is still no generally accepted
scheme in the western world for converting cyrillic characters into roman
script. transcription, by which cyrillic characters are romanized into
phonemes, gives good results for pronunciation but leads to a number of
alternative spellings, whilst transliteration, by which a single roman
character is substituted for each cyrillic character leads to pronunciation
difficulties. with the growth in schemes for catalogue automation it is
essential that a solution is found to this problem. research has shown that
the iso standard offers the best solution although this has unfortunately
found little favour in the usa and uk.

a scheme for the computerisation of the current national bibliography in
bulgaria has been in progress since 1978 and all major scientific and central

series are planned, including a bibliography of contemporary bulgarian
literature, and bibliographies of publications issued by various government
agencies, dissertations, gramophone records, and bulgarian periodicals and
articles in daily papers. there will also be a bibliography of foreign
literature on bulgaria, together with 1 of bulgarian bibliographies. the
frequency of publication will range from 1 week, as in the case of catalogue
cards, through bi-weekly, monthly and quarterly bulletins to annual indexes or
even cumulative indexes published once every few years. the introduction of an
appropriate system, including minicomputers and videotermini, must be
accompanied by the introduction of updated national standards on bibliographic
description, compiled in accordance with the international standards, isbd(m)

in accordance with the dynamic development in socialist countries, greater
attention has been turned to regional and local problems recently. members of
the governing bodies must therefore be kept abreast of the latest information
on their regions to be able to run their economy smoothly and to pursue the
correct cultural and other policies. thus departments of local history in
libraries, and those in the central district libraries in particular, have the
duty and responsibility to build up appropriate bibliographic resources. in
addition to books, daily papers and periodicals, non-book materials such as
records, tapes, documentary films, slides, photos and picture postcards have
become rather significant. as to contents, materials have to be sifted very
carefully to give a comprehensive knowledge of facts, events and development
in the relevant region.

argues that, whereas the danish national bibliography is in no danger as it is
subsidised through the library centre and acquired widely by all types of
library, the selective, specialised bibliographies are given low priority. the
national bibliography has traditionally formed the basis of compilation of
selective bibliographies, but with automation it is less suitable for subject
searches. gives examples of specialised bibliographies whose selections are
not based on the evaluation of qualified people of the total production within
a subject. the danish joint bibliographic committee set up on the instigation
of unesco lacks influence on the production of specialised bibliographies.
urges the library centre and public libraries to pay as much attention to the
analytical, danish specialised bibliographies as they do to the national
bibliography.

subjects are mostly indian mythology and history, and, recently, popular
science. other activities include' writers' workshops, a magazine 2children's
world1, drawing competitions for children, film festivals, book fairs, and a
dolls' museum. the trust also runs a library with toys, games, and 25,000
books for children aged 5-16. the efforts of the trust are praiseworthy, but

translation from english. multinational companies have been prominent in
brazil in all fields of industry and commerce since the beginning of the
century; their involvement in publishing began to increase notably with the
expansion of higher education at the end of the 1950s. the progressive stages
of growth up to the present are described, with details of the various ways in
which such companies have penetrated the book industry and protective
legislation designed to encourage national companies. brazilian firms are
mainly hampered by lack of capital; strategies used to circumvent this problem
are discussed. the multinationals currently established in book production are
listed; many brazilians, however, are involved in these companies, while some
multinationals are covertly involved in national companies. hence the division
of the market between foreign and national producers is difficult to determine
exactly.

presents the conclusions of a paper given at a brazilian seminar on literature
for children in 1978. 21 children's books by brazilian authors were examined,
and found to be composed according to a rigid predetermined structure based on
a clear and absolute demarcation of good and evil, backed by an ideology
legitimising the power of adults over children. draws a parallel with the
subliterature of 19th century france, and postulates that brazilian children's
literature is fundamentally a product of the prevailing social and economic
order, reflecting in the depiction of the parent-child relationship the
producer-consumer relationship of industrial society. the introduction of
superficially contemporary material in language and physical detail does not
affect the essentially reactionary character of such works, and this
ideological rigidity explains their low literary quality.

discusses the development of video in sweden and comments on a report by a
working group of the swedish authors' union' 2video-for better and for worse1.
the report warns against the negative sides of the development, such as
dominance by commercial producers and passivity among viewers, but also points
to advantages, such as freedom of choice and production for minorities. but
for the positive sides to be developed, state support for production and
distribution is necessary. thus the report suggests free loans through public
libraries with state aid for extra staff employed, financed possibly through
various taxes. some form of expansion of film censorship to cover video is
necessary. a government report on video advertising suggests that it be
banned, in the same way as tv advertising. for part 2, 2see1 the following
abstract.

comments on the swedish video commission's report, published in 1981. the
report discusses how video can be used to strengthen freedom of expression.
quality video from abroad must be available. minority groups stand to benefit
from video, and domination by commercial producers and distributors must be
opposed. the report assigns a decisive role to public libraries as
distribution channels, with 'videographers', media workshops and media 'cafes'
attached to local libraries. it proposes state subsidised production with the
swedish educational radio, the swedish television, and the swedish film
institute, among others, as producers. distribution through libraries might
take 3 forms' showing in libraries, loans to individuals and societies, via
cable to homes and institutions. financing is to be the government for the 1st
year and by the local authorities thereafter, with a possible lending charge.
the report's thorough survey of the field should prove useful also to the
other nordic countries. implementation of the proposals is, however, uncertain
owing to the difficult financial position of the public libraries. for part 1,

the first globe of the earth was made at the end of the 15th century; globes
of the heavens were in existence some time earlier. methods of globe
manufacture from the 18th century onwards are described to illustrate the need
for constant improvement. globe manufacture frequently involves work by a
number of different craftsmen. a geographer, mathematician or astronomer
creates the preliminary design, then a carpenter provides a basic wooden
structure which is covered with paper paste. the map must be cut into sections
before being fixed onto the globe and then a top layer of lime or chalk is
added. an alternative manufacturing method is to fill a pottery mould with
paper mache. pocket globes are often made entirely of wood. a globe must be
light, easily turned but perfectly balanced.

consistently underrepresented in library science literature, they are
published in greater proportion in special library periodicals than in the
academic library periodicals sampled by the olsgaards. essentially confirms

friedrich althoff lived from 1839-1908. he was the official university adviser

university and further education from 1897-1907. he was convinced that
libraries were important not only as a basis for academic progress but also in
the education of the people and national awareness. althoff worked in close
cooperation with library directors, otto hartwig, karl dziatzko and august
wilmanns. together they were responsible for carrying out innovations in
library work which were of national importance and developed the prussian
academic library system. among these developments were the introduction of the
prussian library complete catalogue, the improvement of inter-lending systems
between libraries, the founding of an information office of german libraries
in the royal library in berlin (1905) and the opening of the kaiser-wilhelm

discriminating judgement in selecting materials, utilizing all the means at
his disposal, even if it means including things he strongly disagrees with;
librarians must be alert to the power of evil, but to conceal it is not to
destroy it; the librarian spends public money, generated from people of many
faiths, with different cultural and moral backgrounds; librarians need to be,
and to be seen as, open persons who are consistently grappling with the issues
of real life as they are reflected broadly in the publishing world; and
finally, librarians should bea life-enhancing and a life-affirming influence
and the library can be a genuine marketplace of ideas where 'good' books may
compete with the bad simply because they are there together.

text of an interview with dick reumer, director of the nederlands bibliotheek

reumer believes that the most important problems facing libraries in the
netherlands in 1982 are the government's decision to reduce subsidies to
public libraries by 15% and the proposed legislation relating to the public
services, which will replace the present public library act. for the nblc the
new legislation will mean the decentralisation of library services throughout
the regions and closer cooperation amongst libraries in the same area. to
celebrate the 10th anniversary of the nblc a jubilee congress is to be held at
which the centre's services will come under close examination and will be more

training also varies from state to state and may be a library college, a
training library or a polytechnic. there is no clearly defined career
structure for assistant librarians or assistants which causes difficulties

library school courses have for a long time included periods of practical work

in libraries. such periods may take the form of 'self-orientation' periods,

'experience' periods, during which the student may carry out detailed study of
a particular topic. in the netherlands most library school courses are too
short to allow students to gain more than a brief view of library routines in
practice. in addition, students often fail to derive the maximum benefit from
their practical training because of inadequate preparation by the library
schools and the heavy workload of course tutors. there should be regular
consultation between student, course-tutor and training library to ensure that
all aspects of practical training are being covered.

before political independence, education and libraries were dominated by 2
colonial powers, the arabs in the 11th century and the french in the 19th.
since independence in 1960 education and libraries have developed to try and
overcome illiteracy. the former library of the french institute for black
africa became the national library of the new republic of mali, responsible
for collection of material and administration of the national policy for
libraries. libraries have been established in schools and in institutions for
higher education and research. book production in the various national
languages is being expanded. there are at present a total of 46 public
libraries with stocks of between 600-1,000 items for adults and children.
there are also libraries in the cultural centres of foreign embassies, some
private roman catholic libraries and the libraries of international
organisations.

extract from recent trends in resource acquisition in australian academic and
research libraries, a paper presented by g.g. allen and j.r. brockman at the
47th ifla conference, leipzig, aug 81. tabulates and discusses the
distribution of library resources by state as a percentage of national
resources, distribution of population, and library books/inhabitant (all
1933-79). resources are far from evenly distributed among the major population
centres; canberra is particularly well served; and victoria (2nd most populous
state and centre of australia's establishment and business activity) is
surprisingly badly served.

there has been a commercial library in hamburg since 1735. stocks include
about 140,000 books and over 500 german and foreign language periodicals;
about 3,000 items are added annually. although much material was destroyed in
world war ii the library is still valuable to business people, students and
research workers. subjects covered include economics, social science,
commercial law, politics and psychology. the proximity of the university
library obviates the need for comprehensive subject coverage, which is an
advantage owing to the increased number of publications, the current financial
crisis and the growth of new subjects like environmental protection.
traditional manual processing methods are still found to be effective here,
although electronic data processing may be implemented later.

the provision of agricultural information services in kirgizia has greatly
improved with the foundation, in 1975, of the respublikanskaya nauchnaya
selskokhozyaistvennaya biblioteka (agricultural library of the republic), its
designation as the centre of agricultural information services, and the
establishment of the centralised network of agricultural libraries. these
factors provided a framework for the provision of centrally planned, organised
and coordinated bibliographical information comprising' reference information
services, provision of current bibliographical information to agricultural
specialists, answering of individual enquiries, compilation of current and
retrospective subject bibliographies, and the promotion of bibliographical
materials. the use of the central library's stock by specialists in remote
rural areas is made possible through an interlibrary lending service run by

2 characteristics of kibbutz libraries are giving cause for concern;
decentralisation; and the average age of kibbutz librarians. decentralisation
has historic and social causes. formerly, most librarians were volunteers and
various groups in the kibbutz population had separate areas of residence and
activity. modern kibbutz society and organisation have changed, but many small
libraries have remained in existence. decentralisation has many drawbacks'
inefficiency, areas of interest not covered by any library, inconvenience of
many readers and lack of a strong library that could become a focal point in
the cultural life of the kibbutz. the 24 librarians serving in the kibbutzim
surveyed averaged 53.3 years, only 5 of them being younger than 50. this
situation rules out much in the way of development and innovation. calls for a
serious academic study of kibbutz libraries.

the implications of the word 'public' must be considered carefully in
connection with libraries. particular problems are caused in selecting fiction
and leisure material. readers dislike excessive amounts of trivial material as
much as the elitist approach but the illiteracy of some sections of the public
is preferable to the total abstinence of the non-reader. the public library
must bring a new quality to its public service, exercising a corrective
function in respect of book market trends. librarians must mount an offensive
action in pursuit of the sensible, social and humane aspects of their service.
it is dangerous to attach too much importance to statistics. literature should
be provided that crosses all arbitrary borders and stimulates the mind.

public libraries, acting as an effective assistant of party organs and
organisations, play an important role in gaining support for the communist
party policies, its programme for world peace and the building of a developed
socialist society. together with the czechoslovak system for scientific and
technical information they are to play an even more prominent role in making
available information for industry, agriculture and research. the system of
information services in the sphere of culture and the arts within a particular
region is being prepared by the setting up of regional information centres.
bibliography will play a major role in this process of communication of
information. statistics, library planning and the further development of
theoretical librarianship and of library research are to become even more
important components in the time to come.

since world war ii there has been an unprecedented growth in the netherlands
in the provision of public services, including medical care, social welfare
and education. this growth has not been achieved in an orderly manner but has
come about by the sudden expansion of separate sectors. in the last 10 years
control of the public services has become a subject for much discussion in the
dutch parliament with the result that the government has made provision for
members of the public to have a greater say in the running of these services.
in future factors which will seriously affect public library services include
the slowdown in economic growth, increased unemployment and the reduced
birth-rate. to meet these challenges a reform of local government services is
necessary.

founding of the republic in 1950. the public libraries act is a national
framework law. each state has a central library and there are also central
regional libraries in madras, bombay and delhi. below these are the district
libraries, each responsible for between 40 and 80 branch libraries. mobile
libraries serve areas where population is particularly scattered. there are
also university and technical college libraries and some private lending
libraries. current problems include a large population, a wide range of ethnic
groups, religions and languages, illiteracy, inadequate schooling and a
shortage of money.

the period 1890-1930 witnessed a decline in the number of public libraries in
new south wales but by 1930 several prominent citizens began to see them as
useful adjuncts to the campaign to improve australian education. the carnegie
corporation of new york provided financial support and the free library
movement was set up in sydney. mass demand for public libraries was not really
a motive force in the revival. world war 2 emphasised the need to preserve
democracy through education and also established the idea that culture was not
the preserve of the intellectual elite alone. post-war reconstruction brought
with it a tide of largely british immigrants who had higher expectations of
public library services. the impetus provided by the war was short lived,
however, and public libraries were forced to stand alone. this time they were
able to survive through the professionalism of the librarians.

raising the cultural level of life in the countryside is still a major task of
soviet librarianship in the 1980s. recent developments have produced great
quantitative improvements in rural library services, but qualitatively much
still needs to be done. n.k. krupskaya was closely involved with this very
problem in the 1930s and her recommendations are still valid today. if what
she wrote then can be put into practice now, the gap between the levels of
service in town and country can be rapidly narrowed.

coming year will include computerisation and maintenance of basic services in
a time of world recession. 2 main conference topics were' advantages of
centralising the stocks of large libraries, or breaking them down into subject
specialisations. discussion was based on a paper produced by the hungarian
library institute; and scientific research and publications originating from
individual libraries-this varies widely according to the facilities available,
but some libraries produce a great deal of bibliographical research. a variety
of visits during the conference gave the impression that hungarian libraries
were much influenced by western developments and that libraries were heavily
used.

birmingham has 1 of the largest and best library systems in europe, with a
total library budget of over 7 million pounds and over 2 million stock items
for 1 million inhabitants. striking features of the central library include a
quick reference and trade section of over 7,000 works and 7 reference
departments. the 45 branches divide into 4 regional groups in order to
maintain close contact with the central library but yet retain a measure of
independence. many cope with social problems, especially in the inner city
area. an ethnic minorities librarian coordinates all services to foreign
readers. study groups organise projects on reference material, library
publications, radio programmes and staff training. in contrast with many
german libraries, services for children are given particular prominence; in
addition to sections in each branch library there are also 2 central
children's libraries.

1st public library opened here in 1909; the present building was opened in
1970, partly financed by the daimler benz company. in 1980 national library
statistics revealed that sindelfingen has the highest purchasing budget among
libraries of comparable size' 5.70 dm per inhabitant, with a stock size of 2.6

the 10 year plan, published in oct 81, concentrates on the public sector and

output of books and non-book materials and of hamburg's growing immigrant
population. developments in library provision have not kept pace with demand,
particularly for special categories (e.g. handicapped people). ways of
cooperation between libraries and library systems and the relationship between
school and public libraries needs reappraisal. the role of the branch library
in meeting the special needs of the local community must be examined and
better accommodation is needed if the service is to expand. the introduction

the library is part of a foundation established in 1763 by dr. johann
christian senckenberg. in the 19th century, several learned societies
amalgamated their libraries with it; the stocks, comprising works in natural
sciences and medicine, were available for use by local doctors and members of
the newly formed association. in 1907 the library was opened to the public;
new premises were used and professional staff employed. after a period of
financial difficulty during world war i, the johann-wolfgang-goethe university
took over financial control of the library. in 1947 a new agreement was made,
giving the university more powers in library administration and in 1966 the

the library of the university of forestry and timber industry dates back to
the 18th century. a school of mining was founded by king karl iii in 1735.
this school developed and from 1770 also taught forestry science. in 1808 it
became an institute of forestry, and this reflected on the contents of the
library which expanded to cover new subject areas. the institute became the
academy of mining and forestry in 1846 and only acquired university status in
1934. the library development had been hampered by the 1st world war,
inadequate buildings and lack of staff. with the founding of the university a
new library was also planned. the new library building was opened in 1977. it

his private collection, including books, to the province of steiermark, but it
did not become a state institution until 1874 and a library, with its own
building, budget and staff, was not established until 1889. the relationship

there are 3 main ways in which libraries and the media can cooperate. radio
and television can broadcast relevant programmes such as discussions,
interviews with authors and story readings. librarians can use television and
radio to focus the attention of young people on particular issues,
recommending programmes and linking book displays to them. alternatively,
librarians can be actually involved in the production of programmes and can
use them to publicise popular literature and authors. a survey, undertaken in
rostov, showed how effective this form of cooperation could be, but it is
often difficult to achieve.

this review of the literature on undergraduate libraries, the historical
context from which they arose, and their status at the end of the 70s points
out that a long tradition of lack of concern for undergraduate bibliographical
needs was broken dramatically in 1949 by the construction of lamont library,
the harvard undergraduate facility. although designed to solve problems unique
to harvard, lamont was an exemplary construction that soon captured the
imagination of the academic library world. it became the model for a rash of
new libraries aimed at satisfying 'unique' undergraduate needs. these
libraries proliferated during the 50s and 60s, a period of accelerated growth
in academe. by the 70s, however, the general financial retrenchment of
american colleges and universities had virtually halted new construction.
further, the thesis that presumed the needs of undergraduates to be somehow
'different', as well as the advisabi lity of facilities effectively
segregating them from the rest of the academic community, came under attack in
the professional literature. few undergraduate libraries were built during
this period and several were closed or converted to other uses. report not

portugal, italy, greece and spain. one librarian is responsible for the 25,000
books, tapes, newspapers and periodicals in 6 different languages provided on
an annual budget of 200,000 dm in the central library and in branches serving
areas with a large immigrant population. the main stock emphasis so far has
been on fiction for adults and children; non-fiction stocks in foreign
languages will now be expanded since information in them is not always
available in german texts. it is often difficult to obtain information about
foreign book markets and germans know little about the works themselves since
few translations are available. it is important to recognise the cultural
identity of foreign residents and to help them integrate successfully into
west german society.

in a time when librarians have to work with large numbers of readers with
demands of ever-increasing complexity, it is important to organise precisely
the work of individual reading guidance. the process by which a reader selects
a book can be broken down into various stages and decisions, and the librarian
can exert a positive influence throughout the process. if the aims and stages
of the librarian's guidance are planned schematically beforehand, it is
possible to record each reader's progress and reactions in a concise coded
system which is suitable for most public library situations.

the foremost task of all librarians, especially those in public libraries is
to impart to their readers the habit of reading systematically and regularly.
they have to be creative and inventive in catering for their existing readers,
and also in finding ways which will attract new readers. they have to
differentiate their approach according to the readers' age, education,
profession and/or employment, public activities, sex, family circumstances,
hobbies, etc. with the librarian's help readers ought to acquire
'independence' and be able to use the libraries bibliographic resources.

the term 'bibliometrics' was coined by pritchard in 1969 to replace the term
'statistical bibliography' but the 1st bibliometric study appears to have been
made by cole and eales in 1917 when they conducted a statistical analysis of
comparative anatomy literature published between 1550-1860. bibliometric data
conform to a number of laws viz. bradford's law, lotka's law, and zipf's law.
the major sources of data are bibliographies and citations. bibliometrics has
its applications in the fields of book and periodical selection,
characteristics of subject literature, evaluation of collections and
bibliographies, history, and sociology.

inaccurate because of age bias. describes a probabilistic method for adjusting
the raw frequency, and its application to the impact factor and immediacy
index in journal evaluation. the main procedure is that &b of the raw
frequency at any given age is assigned to the previous age and to the
following age, respectively. adjusting the frequency over all ages of use, the

the special collections included in this guide comprise thematically related
groups of material maintained as separate units with the general holdings of
the library of congress. they were either acquired as a unit or specifically
assembled by the library. although valuable resources, these collections are
often challenging to use as they are not recorded in a single card catalogue
or machine-readable data base but rather in a variety of bibliographic guides.
furthermore, some special collections are so vast that it is not feasible to
provide an item-by-item listing. seeks to guide the researcher to resources
that might otherwise be overlooked and describes special collections that have
been singled out by the library's reference staff for their rarity or
potential interest to scholars and summarises the history, content, scope,
subject strengths and organisation of these groups of materials. though
limited to 269 of the many special collecti ons, it illustrates an approach

indicate these libraries spend an average of about $750 a year on documents,
acquire very little free material, and incorporate most documents into the
regular collection or the vertical file. although most acquire the basic
document reference sources and bibliographic tools, very few make any
significant use of interlibrary loan. apparently most cannot provide access to
documents equal to that offered by even small depositories.

periodicals are valuable in every library since they are topical material and
attract new readers who might not otherwise use the library. periodical
selection is important; a list is included of 42 german language periodicals
on all subjects, for adults and children, which could be considered suitable
for a roman catholic parish library. periodical selection by a team is
essential; the team could include the priest, the parish council and
representatives from other interested bodies. selection should take particular
community interests into account but excessive specialisation should be
avoided. finance is always a problem; some individual readers might be willing
to help. it is important to publicise the library's periodical stocks.

reports of journal titles ranked by use with space and cost information
included for each title can provide a means for making certain objective
journal collection development decisions. each title can be assessed in
relation to the others and the data for all titles can be cumulated so that
decisions can be made at various cutoff points. simple ranking of titles by
raw use (rur) may be inadequate and should be adjusted by some measure to
allow for how much of the title is available to the user at the time of the
collection of the use data. if the raw-use frequency of a title is divided by
the actual linear shelf space of the title's file, a 'density-of-use'
frequency is obtained. if these frequencies are then ranked, a 'density-of-use
rank' (dur) is formed. some differences between rur and dur have been
analysed.

for groups and individuals, logic and word games and games encouraging
learning and quick thinking. they can be arranged flat on shelves or placed on
tables. advice on processing and cataloguing is included. each game should be
checked thoroughly immediately after loan; manufacturers will usually supply
spare parts if a game is still in production. the presence of games in the
library should be widely advertised by publicity leaflets, notices in the
press and, since children are the main games users, by contact with youth
groups and kindergartens. organisation by the library of regular games

most academic libraries in west germany already have many audio-visual (av)
aids at their disposal' microfilms, sound recordings in various forms, maps,
posters and individual cubicles for listening to sound recordings. today the
most important aspect of av aids in libraries is not the introduction of every
available new av development into the academic library but the development of
a media section in the library with special emphasis on particular departments
within the library e.g. the music department. new developments such as
viewdata, video, cable television and computer learning aids cannot be
automatically integrated into libraries. various factors must be taken into
consideration when selecting a new av aid for a library; the information
value, economic aspects, and the amount of additional staff training which
will be necessary to make full use of the aids.

the author recently compiled an inventory of north african jewish periodicals
found in 4 major jerusalem collections. while preparing this 1st listing of
145 titles, he encountered several problems, which he shares with librarians.
firstly, there were often discrepancies between holdings listed in the
catalogue and actual collections, which only a first-hand check of each issue
could rectify. moreover, the catalogue is not a satisfactory source for
changes of editors, managers-or even subtitles and other titles (often
appearing in other languages). the central zionist archives posed a special
problem' newspapers as a rule are transferred to its library collection, but
some issues of short-lived zionist periodicals were appended to correspondence
and remain in the archival collection, without being listed in the library
catalogue.

manufacturers' lists provide the only source of information for the librarian
since no comprehensive topical index of religious cassettes exists. cassette
material available in germany containing bible readings and dramatisations,
talks on the catholic faith, the christian way of life, meditation and prayer

shows that the mapping of a particular area of science, in this case
information science, can be done using authors as units of analysis and the
cocitations of pairs of authors as the variable that indicates their
'distances' from each other. the analysis assumes that the more 2 authors are
cited together, the closer the relationship between them. the raw data are
cocitation counts drawn on-line from social scisearch (2social sciences
citation index1) over the period 1972-79. cocitation analysis of authors
offers a new technique that might contribute to the understanding of
intellectual structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to the

each other as well as transitions between different forms of communication at
constant levels. the disappearance of the 'information avalanche' for the
highly specialised information scientist, the greater effectivity of report
literature as compared with periodical literature in the fields of nuclear
research and the noncompatibility of macro and micro information levels can be
quantitatively confirmed. the question remains, how microlevel distribution

citation analysis of faculty publications, doctoral dissertations, and
preliminary doctoral qualifying briefs produced by faculty and students of the
biology department, temple university, is used to assess journal use in the
biology library during the years 1975-77. there are 3,739 citations to 336
journals in the combined sources ranking. the distribution of citations in
each user group ranking and the combined sources ranking takes the form of a
bradford distribution. 60 highly cited titles are examined in detail.
dissertation citations are dependent on active faculty participation in the
doctoral programme. citations in qualifying briefs cover a broader range of
topics and interests than either of the other 2 sources. citation frequencies
of volumes published in the periods 1960-69 and 1970-77 are examined. several
collection maintenance and development decisions have been made, based on the
results of this study. citation analysis is shown to be a useful tool in

a critical appraisal of literature on energy, available at present, in
bulgarian libraries. all possible aspects are covered. foreign publications in
this important field were predominantly french and german in the 1940s, but
nowadays, 60% is written in russian followed by materials in english. during
the past 20 years, even the central regional libraries have established
special collections on energy. major libraries have specialised in 3 areas.
firstly, the central technical library and the library of the bulgarian
academy of sciences have built up theoretical collections and others of
specialist interest, e.g. on nuclear energy. secondly, reference publications
are to be found mainly at the cyril and methodius national library while
thirdly technical colleges and other establishments of higher technical
education concentrate on all aspects of electrical power, installations,
instruments, and so on. in all libraries, the staff responsible for new
acquisitions must bear in mind the latest trends, e.g. conversion of chemical
energy into light, where, so far, the literature available is almost
negligible.

students at the studencheskoe konstruktorskoe byuro aviamodelizma, (students'
aircraft modelling construction bureau), start by reading the literature on a
problem; the road to science starts in the library. the university course on
students' educational research work inculcates the reading habit, independent
work with books. for best results students should abstract the important parts
of their reading, thinking it over unhurriedly. creative interaction with the
text is most important. after lectures, the next stage is the library,
following up points made in the lectures. tactful librarians help readers
choose a book at their level of competence and, in a short conversation, can
arouse strong interest in a book or, conversely, switch a reader over to an
alternative choice.

danish music libraries are also active in this sphere. the 60 music libraries
in germany have so far done little for the handicapped; they should obtain all
available information from the uk and discuss with librarianship and
government bodies the adaptation of the uk scheme for germany. the german
library institute could organise a pilot project for 1983-84. topics to be
considered include the provision of music in hospitals, day centres and
schools, the use of musical instruments by the handicapped, the production of
bibliographies, the improvement of special library services and employment

since librarians themselves are well educated, there is always a danger that
they may cater solely for the wishes of an elite minority and, by excluding
ephemeral literature from stock, discourage many other people from using the
library. the west german national library plan of 1973 states clearly that
libraries must cater for everyone, even if problems are caused by limited
budgets. it is important to remember that emphemeral literature has a relaxing
effect on many people, in contrast to the stimulating effect caused by more
demanding works. a possible solution would be to exclude less valuable
material, such as works involving pornography and violence and then to include
some trivia if careful analysis of reader structure demands it.

the moscow and tul'sk paedagogic institutes recently investigated
schoolchildren's waning interest in fiction and found elementary
schoolchildren read little and were indifferent to fiction. the
extra-curricular reading project for 1st to 3rd forms evolved. here children
learn to examine books carefully before deciding on selection. after 6 months
of this instruction, 65% of 1st-formers were quickly able to find the books
required. the method is supplemented by reading aloud stories about the text,

lecture given at the annual conference of the german library association and
the association of librarians in north rhine-westphalia, oct 80. library
services must react and develop in relation to social change. they must cater
for the needs of both urban and rural communities, where town and country
planning has so often failed. working hours are shorter now than in the past,
so libraries must develop facilities for educational and recreational reading
in conjunction with the mass media. children use libraries more than adults
but the birth rate has fallen and there are more elderly people in the
community today than before; this, however, is no excuse for a decline in
library standards. libraries must become communication centres, in particular
to help the many people living alone and the 4 million foreigners in west
germany.

lecture given at the annual conference of the german library association and
the association of librarians in north rhine-westphalia, bielefeld, oct 80.
(for part 1, 2see1 previous abstract). libraries exist to fulfil human needs
for education, information, communication and general self-development. future
library planning must pay more attention to the balance of stationary and
mobile elements in a system, to local needs and to adult education. both
qualified librarians and voluntary helpers can make valuable contributions to
library services; staff of high calibre are more important than the media
themselves or advanced technical equipment. too much technology in a library
can alienate the readers. it is difficult to generalise about minimum
standards; each library needs its own identity.

under the aegis of the east german ministry of culture, das zentralinstitut
fur bibliothekswesen (central institute for library science) is organising a
programme encouraging library staff to devise new technical aids, work
processes and economic measures. experience has shown that such innovations
can be applied on a scale much wider than that of the original concept,
determining factors being the conditions, structure and technical level of
each library. the innovation does not have to be a new invention but should
rather be a better use of existing material or ideas. those testing the
innovations must have a good knowledge of their subject. more participation
must be encouraged from the young staff members.

public library development has halted at a point when, because of the
recession, library services are particularly necessary. current economic
measures have hit libraries hard. some people now regard information as
merchandise for which a suitable market price must be obtained; this increases
the risk of information services being taken over by private companies, which
could lead to reductions in state budgets. the rapid development of
information technology threatens to bypass the library service and because of
the competitive situation on the information market libraries are being asked
to restrict themselves to their traditional tasks. libraries must mobilise
reserves hitherto unused; refusing to implement new methods of literature
provision could have disastrous consequences. initial organisational problems
can be overcome through rationalisation, centralisation and wider use of
electronic data processing.

in 1978 a cooperative scheme was inaugurated between the combined state and

colleges of technology to produce a union catalogue and organise cooperative
purchasing of books and periodicals. the scheme has also been joined by the
technical university at hamburg-harburg and will ultimately include other
libraries in north germany. work on the union catalogue has begun with the
university's periodicals, for which electronic data processing is used.
changes in the data processing system will shortly be made and more work is
needed on hardware and software. more space and money will be needed as the

construction of a nationwide library and information network' (1) a
legislative model dependent on congress to mandate the network and prescribe

paper presented to a meeting of the working party on provincial central
libraries in deventer, 19 nov 81. in the netherlands the cutbacks in local
government finances together with the growing demand on libraries for
technical information have encouraged public libraries to cooperate with one
another on a regional basis to improve the quality and efficiency of their
services. in addition the expectation that the existing network of libraries
charged with a regional support function will be increased, and the
decentralisation of local government services as proposed in the new public
services act, will further encourage this trend. however, where libraries
enter into schemes of cooperation the needs of their readers should remain the
prime consideration.

cooperative effort going and a pilot project was begun. programmes initiated
included' books-by-mail; countywide courier service; back-up reference

the next 5 years will see the centralisation of specialised libraries, with
libraries of all types forming 1 system; reader services, education towards
communist ideals being the priority; organisation of services to the
community-this should be concerned with every locality, every town borough;
information and bibliographic services, priority being given to party,

centralised library systems have responded in a variety of ways to the call
for greater development of information work. examples from all over the ussr
show how they have undertaken more book promotion and information
dissemination; organised surveys to ascertain the information needs in their
area; paid particular attention to the needs of agricultural workers; and
established important links with the scientific and technical information
centres at republican level. public libraries, mindful of their role to serve
the whole community, are also turning their attention to the needs of
political workers, teachers and others outside the sphere of material
production.

67 did not. suitable questionnaires were sent to each group; detailed analysis
is given of their answers on aims behind list issue, list structure, target
groups, production forms, costs, advertising, possibilities of use control,
alteration processes, criticism against lists and possible alternatives to
them. production of these lists is expensive and time consuming; each library
must decide for itself whether it is worth producing them. if better use is to
be made of the lists, more attention must be paid to the selection of material
and target groups. in future, specific subject lists including non-commercial
works will predominate over lists of general material and electronic data
processing will be used increasingly in their production.

certain aspects of the introduction and use of microfilm techniques must be
observed in order that the possible rationalisation effects may be best used.
it must be remembered that problems can arise through the possibilities of
manifold application of microfilm techniques, which are not necessarily best
solved from the economic point of view just by the use of special equipment.
manufacturers and users of microfilm equipment must cooperate to achieve an
agreement on the production of a range of equipment suited to its purposes and
on long-term basic production measures. methods of estimating the effectivity
of microfilm techniques are presented, with regard to current service
efficiency, types of information work carried out, the kind, size and number
of documents involved, the range of users and the calculation of unit costs
and possible savings.

discusses how micrography can be used to improve organisation, management and
operation of documentation centres using press material. a wide variety of
potential users exists for archives based on newspapers, and while such
centres have problems in common caused by the nature of such materials, each
has requirements of its own dictated by its own special functions. general
topics only are considered here' the possibilities of micrography in
conservation and storage, and how microforms can be used in disseminating
information either in the form of press dossiers or data banks. in conclusion,
discusses copyright restrictions as the main obstacle to expanding the use of
micrography in this field.

there are many ways of processing textual and other forms of information, for
photocomposition and filmsetting through the use of eser computers; various
methods for using these techniques, based on the comprehensive performance
range of the equipment, are described. firstly, a simple example of
typesetting is described to illustrate the technical processes and the
typographically new qualitative characteristics of modern photocopying and
filmsetting equipment. the eser setting programme, developed jointly by the
data processing centre in berlin and other interested bodies involved in
printing and graphics, represents an excellent text processing programme
system which is also available to outside users. the modular concept allows
the rational use of photocomposition and filmsetting for production of a wide
range of information media which can be adapted at low expense.

a project in progress at the open university is studying distance education
institutions as places of work, with the aim of enabling members to consider
implications for information provision in this area. descriptions were
collected from people with different activities in different types of
institution, using the vignette method. a discussion paper will now be
circulated to participants, presenting the general picture which emerges and
raising issues for information provision. the burden will be that, viewing
distance education throughout the world. it is not yet established as a
specialism and also means different things in different contexts. this
suggests a current need for a range of opportunities for information exchange,
provided on a decentralised basis, as contrasted with formal information

of science and industry, thus bringing the total number of branch centres to
2,081 and the total number of their staff to 9,271 in 1980. the development of
automated processing of bibliographic and non-bibliographic information was
influenced by the activities of the central technological base (ctb) of costei
in prague. 11 bibliographical data bases from abroad and 9 domestic ones are
used in various branches and subject. ctb operates 2 data bases of central
inventories (research reports and dissertations, and, reports of business

one of the ways of increasing the contribution of scientific information
services to scientific creative work is through their identification with the
logical, psychological, social and organisational needs of the research
process. cooperation itself between research and information workers can begin
even before there is a specific research task; some institutions have
experimented with the policy that each new researcher has to spend a month or
2 in the information department. the cooperation goes through several stages,
from the preliminary search to avoid duplication in research to the closer
collaboration of both partners' teams. sometimes the collaboration is so close
that an information scientist becomes a co-author.

microelectronics have a strong influence over most contemporary industrial
working processes, including not only the flow of material, energy and
information but also general organisation and management. thus it is clear
that the staff of specialist research organisations have a greater need than
ever before of a comprehensive range of information. examples of this need and
suggestions for its rational satisfaction are presented with reference to
experiences in a strip steel factory concerning the use of microelectronics in
industrial production, scientific research, financial calculations, statistics
and management. the use of microelectronics is still in its infancy; its
potential in large scale information storage and dissemination is not yet

management and the organisation's operations requires active participation in
planning activities and operations support. suggests how similar organisations

of primary and secondary material on patents, an express copying service,
production of bibliographies and cooperation with the other information

user education programmes fall into 2 categories. they may aim simply to help
the student through his course and familiarise him with a single library
(short-term objectives), or to provide a fuller awareness of the generation,
role, and use of information which may allow him to research problems in any
subsequent professional situation (long-term objectives). argues that the
latter are more valuable; the objectives of librarian and student on such
courses are discussed in detail. a user education course based on long-term
objectives is described, and its effects on student and library discussed.

creative activities are currently fashionable; in information and
documentation they have produced a vast quantity of literature, most of which
must ultimately be discarded for financial reasons. nevertheless these
activities are necessary because each student and researcher should offer his
ideas to his colleagues for examination; scientific problems touch on several
disciplines and so require multilateral planning; and neglecting to study
current international literature can prove costly or can result in vague,
utopian projects. young scientists and engineers must devote time to
literature study; training at university level and in the factory or research
centre is needed. official documentation centres must be user-oriented.

collected by libraries in sufficient quantities as it is often not available
through normal market sources via publishers. as information material is
generally in a processed form, libraries do not always classify the contents
further. however, the form in which the material is made available to the user
is very important as it should be possible to make independent use of the
information. often the material is classified to be used by particular user
groups, firms, library collectives or sectors of the information and
documentation system. libraries must take into consideration which user groups
need which information material in their area and also work with other
libraries to provide a larger selection of national and international
information material.

bibliographical work in the ussr is reviewed in the light of the decisions of
the central committee of the communist party in 2on further improvement of
ideological and political education1. main achievements of several libraries
and information centres in the advancement of bibliographical work include
those in the national bibliography, centralised cataloguing and bibliographic
services to science and technology. those aspects of bibliographical work not
developed to a satisfactory level are' children's bibliography, planning and
coordination of bibliographical work and the use of resources. an important
role will be played by automation in the improvement of bibliographical

system of scientific and technical information; students and bibliography;
publishing of bibliographies; standardisation in information science,
bibliography, librarianship and publishing; information services on standards
and patents; centralised cataloguing; vsesoyuznaya knizhnaya palata (all-union

libraries are required to provide bibliographical guidance to and through the
'treaty jungle' engendered by the diversity of national and international
interests caused by the recent dramatic increase in the number of independent
nation states. the degree of accessibility to treaty information is much
greater than before' treaty information is no longer the preserve of
government officials, thanks to publications like the united nations treaty
series. there is still a need, however, for a bibliography of currently
published treaty collections and treaties in force. the many problems still
faced in gaining access to treaty information can only be solved by
international cooperation and better support for the united nations treaty
section.

major functions of recommended bibliography are' to assist in the organisation
of reading with regard to education and development of personality; and to
assist in the professional development of personnel and specialists. a well
developed theory of recommended bibliography is brought into practice through
the unified system of recommended bibliographies. the leading role is held, in
the system, by the gosudarstvennaya biblioteka im. v.i.
.w lenina (lenin state
library) whose work represents the current standard of recommended
bibliography in the country. as the centre of bibliographical work at the

shortened version of an article in 2mechanical engineering1 mar 81. claims
that us engineers largely ignore computerised data banks and use dated and
limited information sources. they collect most of their advanced technical
information through discussions with vendors, salesmen, consultants, and their
peers and restrict their formal reading to the material in the vicinity of
their desks. the culprit is the indexing' the major indexing systems index by
subject or the name of an object, but an engineer wishes to retrieve
information indexed by function. also, vital product information is not
available on a creditable data base.

the expansion of industrially oriented patent information services means that
information on patents must be qualitatively and quantitatively improved,
which presupposes the use of rational procedures for obtaining patent
descriptions. with examples taken from patent descriptions from east and west
germany, the advantages and disadvantages of subject documentation through the
use of primary sources or abstracts are presented. generally the best results
are achieved when content analysis is based on an abstract or summary; primary
sources are often of excellent quality, especially those from east germany,
but their use can be expensive and time-consuming.

the research programme 'design of information systems in the social sciences'
(disiss) conducted a large-scale study of secondary serials and their
effectiveness as information sources in the social sciences. in separate
investigations the following aspects were studied' (1) structure, size and
increase of social sciences literature; (2) nature and degree of coverage and
overlap within the separate disciplines and areas of the social sciences; (3)
design, effectiveness and use of secondary services; and (4) an analysis of
the concentration and scattering within the subject areas, languages, and date
distribution of citations appearing in social science materials. suggestions
are made for the development of alternative solutions.

founded in the usa in 1960 by e. garfield. the institute is a commercial
establishment specialising in the compilation and publication of secondary
information sources in science and technology. a large data base supports the
provision of a series of current information services. a chronological review
of the institute's publications is followed by an analysis of their coverage
of primary materials. the work of the institute has been made known in the
ussr through presentations at various book fairs and several large information
centres and arose a great deal of interest among soviet specialists.

aims to show the current position and future development of linguistic
support, with particular reference to the state automated system of scientific
and technical information (gasnti). the content and structure of linguistic
support is defined by the level of development of the library service and the
information involved. in practice, linguistic support has to take account of
not only the subject content but also a range of external features including
bibliographical description. its application in different systems can be seen
at an international level in unisist, as well as at national and local level.

the bibliography, published since 1976 by the national publishers of the
uzbekistan ssr in tashkent, lists articles from uzbekistan newspapers
published in uzbekish, russian, tadzhikish and karakalpakish. the work appears
monthly and every 3 months also lists reviews from uzbekish newspapers and
periodicals. the 1976 and 1977 editions each listed over 7,000 articles. main
entries are arranged according to the classification scheme of the soviet
national library, whose 31 main classes are described in detail and soviet
cataloguing rules are used. there are also indexes of personal and
geographical names. transliteration problems involving the 4 languages are

 subject search was made in 2british education index 1(january-june 1981) for
information on the following topics. education systems of eastern europe, the
teaching of children from ethnic minorities, the education of mature students,

looking under the more obvious headings and it was impossible to decide when
the search was complete. only a cover-to-cover reading of bei could retrieve
all the relevant articles with any degree of certainty. although much material
was in bei, the use of precis constituted a barrier in every case and made

when continuing observations were made of readers' advisory work carried out
by staff in several different libraries, it was noted that some cataloguing
media are kept for staff use only; instruction on the use of others is
provided for the public. the use of catalogues and reference works for subject
and title requests was analysed, revealing considerable variations in the use
of different media by different people. the dictionary catalogue was the
catalogue type most widely used and some of the most popular subject and
keyword requests are described. the investigation confirmed the necessity of
expanding librarians' subject knowledge and of encouraging flexible reactions
by staff to continually changing situations. for part 1, 2see1 the following

an investigation was carried out into the behaviour of individual librarians
when handling readers' enquiries in the adult lending department of
neubrandenberg municipal and district library, with the intention of assessing
the user-staff relationship in the context of social communication. checks
were made on the frequency of users' visits during different periods of the
day to see whether the librarian had sufficient time for advisory work, which
was in fact the case for about 80% of the time. it is difficult but necessary
to make a quantitative analysis of this type of work in order to make a
comparison of results.

sets out to describe the educational function of bibliographical reference
work, making clear those features which, by way of their active promotion of
information, distinguish it from a purely passive question and answer form of
service. the role of bibliographical reference work in the whole field of
reading guidance is so important that research needs to be undertaken into not
only its organisational and technological aspects, but also its content. only
when bibliographical methods are employed in all processes of library work
will a higher level of book promotion be achieved.

the availability of information is vital for economic, social, educational and
personal development. information is at present and for the foreseeable future
largely contained in publications. a number of factors are contributing to an
increase in the demand for publications, but many nedcs remain unmet. the
development and improvement of services by publishers, the book trade,
libraries and other types of information service requires intellectual and
financial commitment, national and international planning based on valid and
reliable data, coordination and cooperation, and will require action by
governments, professional associations and individual institutions.

since the mid 70s the term uap (universal availability of publications) has
been current in library work. librarians have developed the process of making
publications available universally along various lines. in bulgaria the
concept has been taken up with much interest and discussed in detail. uap is
to develop on 3 levels' national, regional and international. the national
library in sofia has developed a catalogue system which presents a current
bibliographical record of all national publications-this bulgarian national
bibliography is published in 8 series. it enables the national library to
supply literature on both national and international levels. the availability
of foreign literature is improved by literature information sources such as,
2the central catalogue of foreign periodicals1 and 2the bulletin of foreign
monographs1 both of which are now available in computerised form.

since independence, ghana's book industry has received a great deal of
encouragement from the state to develop a viable modern indigenous
infrastructure. its progress has been hampered by deteriorating economic and
other factors. low literacy is slowing down the spread of the book culture,
and combined with obstructive indifference of officials, access to and
availability of indigenous publications are proving difficult. libraries are
facing enormous obstacles in their attempts to improve the situation. action
at the national and international levels is a possible solution to the
promotion of uap (universal availability of publications).

study day on 'shocking books', criticises the method of investigation chosen,
a questionnaire on 25 selected titles distributed to librarians, as ambiguous,
and proposes instead that user responses to a less restricted selection of
books be investigated. secondly discusses the place of cultural activities in
public libraries in relation to a study day on this theme, arguing that the
library's priority is to provide satisfactory documentation and information
services; other activities are only of secondary importance, and should be
considered as publicity strategies rather than actual user services.

shortened version of a paper presented to the section on information
technology, ifla manila conference, 1980. to attain the goal of universal

each country using chinese characters must formulate a standardised chinese
character set; and conversion tables must be devised to enable such countries
to exchange marc tapes with meaningful results. a common core character set

developed in us academic libraries and whether today the integration of those
procedures is possible and desirable. concludes that the organisation of
procedures by function and the growing use of automation can result in more

of technical services as they are known today and to a new definition of
library work whereby work is organised by subject and/or service and by
function within a subject, not by format.

300 replies to a questionnaire on acquisitioning in bibliotekar' (moscow) (1)
1981 were received: 200 from municipal libraries, 100 from rural ones. 54% of
libraries mentioned library suppliers' unsatisfactory management of

greatest deficiencies were in supplying fiction and children's literature,
followed by history, technology, art, agriculture, medicine, natural history,
popular science, sport, literature, ethics and law, education, domestic
science. libraries in new towns have acute acquisitioning problems. school
libraries should acquisition centrally through library suppliers.

over the last 20 years there has been a rapid growth both in the numbers of

study of the practice of self-censorship by librarians in us secondary school
library media centres. questionnaires were sent to 718 librarians and 478
usable returns were collected. librarians seem, in their selection, to avoid
controversial titles; the identification of the absence of controversial
titles from the librarians' collections was not uniformly a signal for the
ordering of titles; and the presence of large numbers of restricted access
materials again indicates librarians' reluctance to face censorship battles.

since the 1970s the public have made great use of the sound cassettes provided
in libraries, which has encouraged librarians to increase stocks. librarians
are used to coping with the relatively well organised book market, where lists
and reviews of new publications are easily obtained and criteria for
evaluating them well established. the structure of the sound cassette market
is unfamiliar to librarians. few large firms produce cassettes regularly;
small numbers of individual tapes are often produced, which disappear before
they can be listed and reviewed. the borromeus association's library centre
reviews new tapes to help librarians select stocks. criteria for evaluating
tapes are not yet firmly established; assessment should cover the technical
quality of the recording and the standard of the material recorded.

possible criteria for evaluation are' the extent to which the course content
is adapted to adult needs; the suitability of the course's didactic
construction to those needs, especially the use of realistic situations and
background information; the topicality of vocabulary, idiom and grammar; and
the acoustic quality, which should use different speakers and natural speech

information is given from reports published since 1976 on the german research
association foundation section's role as provider of money for the purchase of
complete special libraries and posthumous works. 46 such collections have been
purchased to date and distributed to various libraries throughout the country.
in 1980 purchases included some posthumous papers of ludwig binswanger for the
bavarian state library, the library of the music historian friedrich gennrich
for frankfurt municipal library and a collection on german political history
for the konrad adenauer foundation. the section has also assisted a working
party of historical research associations outside the universities in the
purchase of similar collections.

the survey covers only prices of monographs in east germany. the range and
criteria for the random sample corresponds to the purchasing policy of a
library at the 2nd level according to 2bibliotheksplan '731, (2library plan
19731). the statistics show developments from 1975-79 in amounts spent and
proportions of a total budget. from these figures it can be seen that 840,000
dm would have been needed for monograph purchase in 1980, a budget only
exceeded by 17 libraries at this level. price rises varied according to type
of material but showed relative stability where library selection was
concerned. from these figures the average expenditure required for 1982 can be
calculated.

the austrian law of legal deposit was due for reform, partly to bring up to
date the price limits for books deposited, and partly to extend the scope to
include multi-media categories. the new act, which came into force in june 81,
is criticised for its exclusion of non-book materials (especially films) in
spite of the fact that the austrian national library has a legal obligation,
since july 81, to maintain multi-media archives. there is also criticism of
the inclusion of parliament as a deposit library, of the extended categories
of exemption and of the decision to allow publishers 1 month in which to
deposit instead of 8 days as previously.

the term 'dormant exchange' describes an exchange system in which 1 library
needs and obtains an item at a given time from another library but not vice
versa. an exchange is still made, however, but on a credit system so that the
other library can request desired material at a later date when the need
arises, thus eliminating wasteful exchanges. the operation could be greatly
simplified by the introduction of an internationally valid exchange token
enabling a recipient library to pay for exchange material and a providing
library to receive credit for what is supplied. it is conceded that valuation
of tokens could be problematic.

the special commission for acquisition coordination, particularly with respect
to foreign periodicals and other publications, has been in operation for more
than 20 years. during that time, several national venues have taken place
under the auspices of the commission to keep librarians abreast of the latest
developments, in particular in the field of international exchange of
publications. 1 of the latest seminars dealt with copyright problems after the
wide introduction of modern reprographic equipment. international exchange has
been firmly established in major bulgarian libraries, including the cyril and
methodius national library, the bulgarian academy of sciences library and the
university of sofia library. exchange is the only way to reduce the depletive
effect of the rapidly growing prices of western periodicals and books on the
foreign currency allowances available to bulgarian libraries. the commission's
foremost task is to remove obstacles a nd to encourage further positive steps
in this important section of library and information services.

the free transmission service for other institutions. emphasises the necessity
of strengthening exchanges with southeast and south asian neighbours in the
light of relatively weak exchange relations with that region.

national availability of publications must be supplemented by international
availability. the best evidence for the need for better international
provision is supplied by data on international lending. the volume of
international lending and photocopying is about 1 million items a year and is
growing rapidly. satisfaction rates and supply times both need improvement.
about 2/3 of demand is for journals, and is concentrated on a small number of
centres, which give a much better than average service. speed of supply
appears to be unrelated to distance. possible patterns of provision for the
future include access to improved collections of national imprints, regional
systems, and large national document supply centres in countries with heavy
interlending demand.

paper presented at the 4th finnish-soviet seminar on the role of interlibrary
loans in the provision of information services to science and industry, held
23-24 apr 79. interlibrary lending system in finland comprises a network of
research libraries as well as some 50% of public libraries. regional libraries
have the role of interlending centres; the helsinki city library has the
function of the national centre. organisation of the system is described.
although there are not, so far, any fixed procedures the regional centres act
as intermediaries between the public and the research libraries. in its role
of the finnish bibliographical centre the helsinki university library
publishes the union catalogue of foreign publications. the library has the
fullest collection, outside the ussr, of russian 1820-1917 imprints due to its
legal deposit rights to russian publications in this period. statistics are
given of loans from this collection.

argues that developing networks for public libraries in the usa is not the
answer to problems of limited financial resources. users prefer to take a 2nd
choice which is available immediately from the shelves to a 1st choice which
has to be obtained from elsewhere and the 1st thing to be cut as funding falls
is resource sharing activities. presents statistics for interloans in
california and illinois to show what a minute % of circulation is accounted
for by interloans. relying heavily on materials not available at once in a
library is akin to a return to closed stacks. suggests the development of an
equivalent to the british library lending division.

a method based on a constrained optimisation technique is presented to
determine the time of removal of scientific periodicals from the shelf of a
library. the problem is that of minimising shelf maintenance cost on the
condition that the loss of the information is less than some specified rate.
the solution obtained indicates that all the utilities of the periodicals
should be equal at the removal time. a geometrical interpretation of the
theoretical result is given. a numerical example is given to show how this
technique is applicable to real bibliographical data.

each year a considerable amount of material is written off by public libraries
as a result of theft or damage by library users. in the maastricht public
library in the netherlands a study of the problem made from jan-june 81 showed
that some material was removed from the library without registering the
transaction, some was borrowed on tickets containing false or incorrect
information, while others were borrowed and not returned, or returned in a
damaged condition. where proof of theft or destruction of library property
exists the dutch civil code allows library authorities to instruct the local
chief inspector of justice to take legal proceedings against the guilty party.
where the defendant is found guilty the judge may order compensation to be
made to the library concerned.

founded in 1960, the workshop was 1st concerned mainly with bookbinding; a few
years later a separate section was opened for document preservation and
restoration of papyri and other manuscripts. total estimates for damaged
material in the early 1960s were over 422,000 dm, a sum which at that time
could not be met. the floods of 1962 in hamburg caused particular problems.
since 1978 extra financial help has come from the volkswagen foundation. the

awareness stimulated by well-publicised disasters has resulted in the
development of prevention and preparedness plans and in better techniques for
coping responsibly if the worst happens. understanding the natural hazards of
an area, anticipating problems and maintaining buildings and grounds to
withstand disaster may make a difference between total loss and damage. fire
prevention is extremely important as fire not only destroys books but brings
the possibility of massive volumes of water. considerations for preplanning
include assigning specific tasks, knowing sources of supplies, lists of
relevant telephone numbers, establishing priorities in the stock, developing
plans for treating water- and fire-damaged materials and insurance. briefly

the theft of books from large, open-plan university libraries is a many-sided
problem. it has reached such proportions that it is costing universities in
west germany tens of thousands of dm every year and special detector systems
have been installed in some libraries. these have led to many would-be thefts
being prevented and charges being brought for theft. however, the majority of
these charges have had to be dropped owing to loopholes in laws applicable to
book thefts. german criminal law stipulates that the intention of keeping an
object must be present to constitute a theft; this is usually impossible to
prove in the case of book thefts. university administrative law also fails to
provide adequate penalties and varies from one state to the next. it is
necessary to define the theft of books as an offence in administrative law,
punishable by a fine throughout west germany.

in 1975 a recommendation was made in the baden-wurttemberg library plans to
introduce computerised lending systems in all university and state libraries.
a pilot project to test the possibilities of such a system was started in
freiburg university library in oct 77. the automation progressed in 3 phases'
the fiction and text book collection; the public book collection; the
stockroom collection. a dietz standard computer system with adaptations for a
lending system was used. the introduction of the automated process in the 1st
2 stages of the plan was very successful and led to preparations being made
for other libraries in tubingen and karlsruhe to adopt the system. the 3rd
phase will be completed by the beginning of 1982. the computerised lending
system led to an increase in lending from 350,000 in 1975 to 700,000 in 1980
which reflects a considerable improvement in the library user service.

east asian holdings would help users more familiar with characters and with
different pronunciations in different languages and dialects. suggests that
librarians should hold back automation until an integrated system which can
cope with both romanised and character data at a reasonable cost is developed
and then aim for a centralised cataloguing system for all east asian materials
throughout australia, possibly based on the national library of australia but
with input from all libraries with east asian materials.

and the senate catalogue, and to pinpoint the time of peak card catalogue
usage in order to measure more closely the rate of use. this measurement,

structure. advantages of the special catalogue are' it lists monographs and
periodicals together; periodicals are given a subject classification; the
notation is easier to remember than that used in the main catalogue; the

a study of the transaction counts for 2 1/2 years' activity at the public use
terminals of the ohio state university libraries' prototype on-line card
catalogue to determine what search options academic library patrons use the
most often and whether this pattern varies from that reported in major
catalogue use studies. the preliminary findings indicate significant
differences in search strategy that may result from a unique user group that
prefers to search the on-line catalogue, more useful searches in the on-line
system, or special search patterns imposed by the computer hardware itself.
both the different searches used by patrons and why they chose them should be
important factors in the design of future on-line catalogues.

an exploration of previous attempts to provide a satisfactory justification
for the treatment of corporate bodies as authors reveals a history of partial
answers and insufficiently detailed analyses both of corporate authorship in
particular and of authorship in general. the reason for the failures probably
rests in the fact that authorship is both a complex phenomenon and necessarily
such a fundamental concept in the construction of a library catalogue that it
is taken for granted. part i deals with the development of the concept of
corporate authorship and part ii with the nature of authorship in general
under the headings' authorship by origination, authorship by assumption of
responsibility, corporate utterances and corporate authorship. in conclusion

college and university libraries technical services coordinating group
workshop, vancouver, b.c., 14 june 80. discusses changes in the cataloguing of
periodicals introduced by aacr2 in 3 groups' those that may be considered
improvements over the aacr1 and ala practices; those of a controversial
nature; and those that are primarily cosmetic. the changes are seen to be
generally beneficial, leading to greater consistency in catalogue records for
periodicals.

the authorised edition of rak was published in berlin in 1976 and in wiesbaden
in 1977. this completed alphabetical cataloguing reform in germany. from
1976-79 much literature dealing with rak was published. many of the
publications were concerned with adaptations of rak to specific types of
libraries such as rak-wb (wissenschaftliche bibliotheken) academic libraries
or rak-ob (offentliche bibliotheken) public libraries. this was also the case
in east germany where adaptations of rak for public libraries, research
libraries and union libraries were published. literature is available
explaining in detail the use of rak in certain subject areas such as law,
biblical literature, archive literature, journals, newspapers and congress
reports. reports and discussions on experiences of libraries in the
introduction of rak and the best methods of training staff mostly stem from
east germany and are only first initiatives in this field.

the new rak (rules for alphabetical cataloguing) section on the cataloguing of
musical scores and sound recordings has been available in pre-print form since
the beginning of the year. practical testing of and discussion on the section
are essential to reveal any gaps or ambiguities so that these may be
eliminated. the question of what constitutes a title page where a record is
concerned must be considered. according to the new rules, the label on the 1st
side of a record or record set should be treated as the title page; if there
is insufficient information here the record cover should be used instead.
examples illustrate problems and possible discrepancies between labels and
covers.

paper presented at the canadian library association's canadian association of
college and university libraries technical services coordinating group
workshop, vancouver, b.c., 14 june 80. in the early 1970s 2 national task
groups recommended the establishment of a national serials data base in
canada. to create a data base libraries must share data about serials.
standards are a pre-requisite to sharing data-a standard definition of a
serial, the issn, the marc format, standards for holdings statements and
library symbols and cataloguing standards. use of standard sources of data
also facilitates sharing. a national serials data base now exists in canada on
the federal government dobis system jointly maintained by the national library
of canada and the canada institute of scientific and technical information.
data on holdings of major canadian libraries are collected and edited in a
central location.

the project's objective is to create an on-line regional union catalogue of
monographs and audiovisual materials using existing machine readable records
of participating libraries created in a variety of systems. the resultant file
will be searchable by author, title, subject and keyword, and will facilitate
resource-sharing by expediting the provision of monographs and audiovisual
materials within a 6-state region of the usa; it will further provide valuable
statistical information for coordinating collection development. 1 important
aspect is the expediting of interlibrary loan requests, by automatic
generation and the storage in massage files for the holding library, without
the rekeyboarding of data.

the danish technical library at the danish technical university set up a data
base in 1968 containing locations of the library's own holdings. at the end of
the 70s this facility was expanded to an on-line system of locating also other
libraries' acquisitions and connected to scannet and euronet. describes a new
development of the system, called alis (automated library information system),
initiated in nov 81. it is now possible to requisition titles through the alis
catalogues. these titles will be those readily available, as the library's
loans will be registered in the terminal from 1982. use of alis is free. the
system, described diagrammatically, consists of a local system for
administration of loans, and the i/s datacentralen's free text standard search

the connecticut automation coordinating committee (cacc) was formed in 1980 to
provide an opportunity for all groups, libraries and organisations engaged in
or interested in developing automated systems to meet regularly to share
information and to begin an informal planning effort. discusses major issues
that the cacc has faced which have implications for other states. a statewide
on-line union catalogue is likely to consist of components developed
independently by individual libraries or groups of libraries which have
voluntarily adopted guidelines and standards suggested by the cacc. the role
of the cacc is the identification of existing and emerging catalogues which
might become components, the promotion of adequate access to those components
and the assurance that there is a reasonable prospect of eventual linkage and
integration of those components.

the use of 'narrow' catchwords as a principle element in catchword catalogues
is no longer acceptable. the term 'narrow' is too vague and does not convey
the content and meaning which it should. the principle of the 'narrow'
catchword has always been regarded as defining a classification method; this
is however, not the case. libraries would be advised to conform with standard
terminology used in documentation and information science and to avoid further
use of the 'narrow' catchword or 'narrow' term. the control of classification
terminology is a very important area of library science which should be more
clearly defined. examining such terms as the principle of the 'narrow'
catchword is, therefore, 1 step towards eliminating terminology which has no
real meaning or use.

recent articles have analysed retrieval systems with continuous weights of
various types and/or with a boolean structure for the queries. they have also
suggested criteria which such systems ought to satisfy and record evaluation
mechanisms which partially satisfy these criteria. offers a more careful
analysis, based on a generalisation of the discrete weights. also looks at the
weights from an entirely different approach involving thresholds, and
generates an improved evaluation mechanism which seems to fulfil a larger
subset of the desired criteria than previous mechanisms. this new mechanism
allows the user to attach a 'threshold' to the query term.

a major deficiency of traditional boolean systems is their inability to
represent the varying degrees to which a document may be written on a subject.
in this article a number of criteria that should be met by any boolean system
generalised to have a weighting capability are isolated. it is proven that
only 1 weighting rule satisfies these conditions; that associated with
fuzzy-set theory; and that this weighting scheme satisfies most of the other
properties associated with boolean algebra as well. probabilistic weighting is
then introduced as an alternative approach and the 2 systems compared. in the
limit of zero/1 weights, all systems considered converge to traditional
boolean retrieval.

discusses the paradox of traditional library classification' the aim of
expressing on subject in detail is in conflict with the aim of providing an
inexpensive and useful device by which books can be shelved and retrieved.
suggests the use of 2 different schemes (or 2 levels of the same scheme). the
1st scheme would provide classification numbers of reasonable lengths to
arrange items in broad subject groups whilst the 2nd scheme (or variant of the
1st) would provide longer numbers for detailed subject access and
comprehensive browsing capability in on-line systems. these schemes could be
applied to all types of library materials.

discusses the development of uk and us ideas on subject headings and
classification from the time of panizzi's challenge to classified cataloguing
through the practical approach of cutter and hulme to the work of bliss.
cutter and hulme never fully developed their practical approach, leaving the
way clear for the theoretical classificationists such as otlet and richardson.
universal decimal classification was the manifestation of their principles and
also the beginning of a decisive historical movement that culminates in the
work of bliss. his great value is that he offers an independent perspective on
the history of classification and subject indication and is reasonably
encouraging about colon classification, the system that ended the formative
classificationist period in anglo-american thought.

a conference was held at the greifswald university library on 20 nov 80 on the
application of the soviet library bibliographical classification (bbk) system
by research libraries in east germany. the purpose of the conference was to
bring together members of research libraries which had introduced bbk to
discuss their experiences in the application of the system. as the greifswald
university library had the most experience in this field (19 years) they took
the initiative in convening the conference. members of different libraries
gave talks on various aspects and problems of introducing bbk. all the
advantages of bbk should be used when adapting it to an existing
classification system and the minimum number of changes made. some of the
problems discussed were' adaptations necessary in subjects such as social
sciences, marxism-leninism, biophysics, biochemistry and molecular  biology;
the problems of the further development of bbk and experiences in

in udc a large number of symbols are used to form the complex notation. most
of these symbols have several possible meanings which cause problems,
especially in the case of the colon, when udc is used in an automated
information system. the colon is clearly intended as a sign denoting a
relationship needing no further definition between 2 numbers. the use of the
colon with more than 2 udc numbers, although unofficial, has become
widespread; the range of permitted permutations is described. where the colon
may be used between 2 numbers, the possible reversibility of the relationship
may be taken for granted. if the possibility of permutation is removed then
the colon resumes its original function of denoting a hierarchic relationship
between 2 or more udc numbers.

emphasised correlation between the number of descriptors and the
non-descriptors. then the number of non-descriptors was found to increase more
slowly than that of the descriptors, demonstrating that the proportion of
non-descriptors to the total vocabulary decreases as the number of descriptors
increases. the inis thesaurus (international nuclear information system) is
described in relation to this theory and found to be well produced.

there are 3 different approaches to the use of indexing languages based on
classification schemes for searching computer files for subject requests. the
mechanical approach simply extends the principle of the card catalogue; the
coordinated approach uses as a search format a list of classification features
each serving a heuristic function; the integral approach provides a synthesis
of classification and word languages without the drawbacks of the other 2, and
offers the most long-term possibilities. detailed examples show the operation

on-line retrieval systems may be difficult to use, especially by end users,
because of heterogeneity and complexity. investigations have concerned the
concept of a translating computer interface as a means to simplify access to,
and operation of, heterogeneous bibliographic retrieval systems and data
bases. the interface allows users to make requests in a common language. these
requests are translated by the interface into the appropriate commands for
whatever system is being interrogated. system responses may also be
transformed by the interface into a common form before being given to the
users. thus, the network of different systems is made to look like a single
'virtual' system to the user. the interface also provides instruction and
other search aids for the user. philosophy, design and implementation of an
experimental interface named conit are described.

.I 5383
.W
the evaluation of the concept of a translating computer interface for
simplifying operation of multiple, heterogeneous on-line bibliographic
retrieval systems has been undertaken. an experimental retrieval system, named
conit, was built and tested under controlled conditions with inexperienced end
users. a detailed analysis of the experimental usages showed that users were
able to master interface operation sufficiently well to find relevant document
references. success was attributed, in part, to a simple command language,
adequate on-line instruction, and a simplified natural language, keyword/stem
approach to searching. it is concluded that operational interfaces of the type
studied can provide for increased usability of existing systems in a cost
effective manner, especially for inexperienced end users who cannot easily
avail themselves of expert intermediary searchers. furthermo re, more advanced
interfaces based on improved instruction and automated search strategy
techniques could further enhance retrieval effectiveness for a wide class of
users. for part 1, 2see1 preceding abstract.

accessed an average of 1-4 times daily by each user; and is most often used
for news, weather, travel, and sport. 93% of users are satisfied, although 29%
describe it as incomplete. warns that current users are highly innovative in
their approach and may not be typical of future users. concludes that a

machine-readable output (mro) from on-line searches is useful in the
compilation of large bibliographies. arrangements were made with a major
on-line retrieval vendor to obtain (for a fee) output in the form of magnetic
tape, rather than conventional off-line prints on paper. a programme was
written to transform and process the data; part of this programme is similar
to a computer compiler. a method of checking for duplicate items was
developed. mro is cost-effective and eliminates the time-consuming and
labour-intensive data entry process. it is a natural extension of the powers
of on-line retrieval systems.

the problem of data element representation is more extensive than most
perceive. the number of standards (internal, national, and international) is
large, but the use of standards in data bases is not widespread. the result is
a significant lack of standardisation both within and across data bases. the
result becomes apparent when one attempts an exhaustive search on a particular
data element in multiple data bases. the journal title element was studied in
8 data bases, and 4 measures were developed to show the extent of
standardisation within a data base and some of its implications for searching.

obvious advantages of on-line literature research compared to traditional
methods such as library subject catalogues are' the research results are

the frequency characteristics of terms in the documents of a collection have
been used as indicators of term importance for content analysis and indexing
purposes. in particular, very rare or very frequent terms are normally
believed to be less effective than medium-frequency terms. recently automatic
indexing theories have been devised that use not only the term frequency
characteristics but also the relevance properties of the terms. the major
term-weighting theories are 1st briefly reviewed. the term precision and term
utility weights that are based on the occurrence characteristics of the terms
in the relevant, as opposed to the nonrelevant, documents of a collection are
then introduced. methods are suggested for estimating the relevance properties
of the terms based on their overall occurrence characteristics in the
collection. finally, experimental evaluation results are shown comparing the
weighting systems using the term relevance properties with the more
conventional frequency-based methodologies.

there are comparatively few printed sources concerning book printing in the
15th century in germany. most of the examples are from spain or italy. from
various sources, mostly printers work contracts, we know the quantity of
foolscap pages which the following printers were able to produce daily' 1473
philippus de lavagna in milan 839 pages; 1475 andreas portilia in bologna 880
pages; 1476 petrus maufer in padua 1,247 pages; 1476 abraham ben solomon conat
in mantua 1,000 pages; 1477 petrus maufer 1,332 pages; 1484 antonio di
bartholomeo misconini in florence 394 pages; 1499/1500 johann luschner in
montserrat 1,618 pages. draws some general conclusions from this survey. in
the mid 1470s printers were in a position to print about 900 foolscap pages
per day per printing press. by the end of the century improvements to the
presses had led to a gradual increase in production to about 1,200 pages a

2 separate proposals laid before (1) the belgian senate in mar 81, and (2) the

modification of the original law necessary, invoking the berne convention as a
guiding principle. the proposals then set out in detail largely similar
suggestions for insertion of amendments, with comprehensive comment on and
justification of the points covered, which include the necessity for authors'
permission, limit on maximum number of copies, obligations of owners of

the guide is based on lectures and training classes to prepare the copyright
office staff and interested members of the public for implementation of the
copyright act of 1976, most provisions of which took effect 1 jan 78. in
developing lectures and lesson plans, the author relied heavily on the
language of the law itself, the legislative reports, and various statements of
the register of copyrights to the congress, i.e., the 1961 report of the
register, the 1965 supplemental report, and the 1975 second supplemental
report. these documents may also be obtained from ntis. this guide is not an

issues raised by the revision legislation nor to provide answers to legal

considers reasons why many books published in the indigenous african languages
are not commercially successful. discusses briefly the findings of a survey
conducted amongst the main publishers of material in the african languages,
and concludes that only books which are prescribed reading for examinations
sell in large numbers. notes with regret that there is not a single centre or
library in africa that is systematically collecting creative writing in the
african languages. attitudes to books and reading in africa are seen as being
governed by many social and cultural factors, and as being also heavily
affected by the lack of a sufficient number of retail outlets or libraries.
argues that, whilst the african book professions have a major role to play,
the initiative for significant change must largely come from government backed
programmes, and initiatives by local authorities with the aid of the media.

since the 1950s the study of children's literature has developed into an
autonomous academic discipline. research institutes and information centres as
well as societies and associations in the field have proliferated. several
scholarly periodicals are devoted entirely to children's literature. current
academic interest in children's literature has been reflected in the growing
number of dissertations and theses for advanced degrees. this tendency is also
discernable in south africa. an information centre for children's literature
and media (iskemus) was established at the university of stellenbosch in 1978.
potchefstroom has an institute for research in children's literature which has
already held 2 country-wide symposia and has had a book published under its
auspices by tafelberg. academic study of the genre necessitates the formation
of collections of children's books and media reflecting the personal bias an d
interest of the researchers. such collection building has become increasingly
difficult because investors regard fine children's books as sound financial
investments because of their scarcity. at stellenbosch a private collection of
about 1,000 books reflects the cultural influence of mainly victorian english
middle-class juvenile reading matter, 1830-1930. a very brief indication of
some of the interesting items is reflected in the select, annotated abstract
of the catalogue of historical books.

compares the scottish libraries/book trade relationship with the third lanark

libraries spent approximately *64.5 million on books, 52% of which was spent
outside scotland. explains why the scottish book trade needs the libraries'
custom to survive, why the libraries have an obligation to their public to
order from their native book trade, and how the libraries and book trade
together can make a basic contribution to scottish culture.

part ii of a 2-part article on the development of librarianship in nigeria
based on a paper presented to the library association of singapore, 22 sept

carnegie corporation grant. with the opening of other schools it is now
possible to train most of the library personnel needed within nigeria. besides
legislations for the national library, some state governments have passed laws
for establishing library services. library provision is still uneven in

report on ifla's 46th conference, manila, aug 80, the 1st held in a third
world country. the general theme was' development of libraries and information
systems' global information exchange for greater international understanding.
some activities of the latin american section are mentioned, e.g. its call for
the recognition of spanish as 1 of the ifla languages. the resolutions put
forward by the african section included a suggestion for the establishment of
a west african clearing centre with the purpose of facilitating inter-library
loans. mentions the support given by unesco to the project on universal
availability of publications. the president of the philippines in his opening
address touched on the information gap between the west and the third world
and on the importance of placing the conference in a developing country. this
was the 1st conference held under ifla's new statutes, which allow  for more

summarises a content analysis carried out on a sample of 12 issues of 2library
journal1 from 1958 to 1980. data is given for number of pages per issue, total
pages per year, one-year subscription cost and price per page. the 85
articles, which appeared in these issues, were analysed by subject matter,
type of library described and characteristics of authors. concludes that one
trend, is towards fewer articles occupying a smaller fraction of the total
number of pages and the subjects are less concerned with library materials and
administration and more concerned with professional organisations. another
trend is towards a greater emphasis on advertisements and book reviews.

report of an analytical study of 2library literature1 and 2library and
information science abstracts1. the main criteria used were currency of
references; width of coverage; quality of indexing; and quantity of
references. issues covering a 1 year period (1979) were examined and results
for each periodical compared. additional characteristics were also compared'
language of material indexed, countries of origin, type of material, inclusion
of indexes, and price. the final conclusion drawn was that the 2 periodicals
are largely similar apart from variations in index provision, classification
procedure, and primary sources covered.

results to librarians. outlines' the type of research necessary; who should do
it and where, suggesting that library school staff and students are

agencies. meaningful research will follow only when there is consensus on the
reality of concerns and a perceived willingness in librarians to invite
solutions and innovation.

discusses the development of, and comments critically on the performance of
unesco's international information system on research in documentation
(isorid). the isorid programme was launched in the early 1970s as an
internationally-dimensioned mechanism for the recording of planned, ongoing,
and completed library and information science research, and during a period
operated as a joint venture between fid and unesco. concludes that a number of
problems and syndromes characterise isorid' much relevant information is not
finding its way into the system; there are considerable time-lags between the
recording of r&d projects and their listing in the printed services;
sophistication and optimisation of systems functions along with a higher
degree of 'user friendliness' is required; and a real user study would be
desirable.

gotthold ephraim lessing was librarian at the court of brunswick and luneberg
in the 1770s. some of his most important writings were produced during this
period but it should not be thought that the post was a sinecure held to
enable him to write. there is proof in his own works that he took
librarianship seriously. the opinions of various contemporary and modern
writers on lessing's library work are analysed. many of his contemporaries
thought him disorganised but his catalogue of new library stocks, amounting to
about 100,000 volumes, remained unfinished because of staff shortages and
ultimately because of his own death. some people regard him as the theoretical
founder of modern lending libraries.

translation of a paper presented at a congress of the iaald in manila in 1980,
giving a general view of library and information services in the agricultural
field in relation to librarianship in general and in other fields. a
preliminary definition sets out the nature of the work of the agricultural
librarian, and then the special characteristics of the field are discussed in
detail' its interdisciplinary nature, the wide range of types of
documentation, its international character, and the need to disseminate
information to a diverse community representing a wide variety of educational
backgrounds. the organisation and operation of existing services are examined
with reference to information resources and cooperative activities, where the
extent to which network opportunities are used depends on the scale and focus
of services offered, and this in turn influences professional duties. the
education and skills essential for the p rofessional are analysed in relation
to the changes in information and library services in general caused by social
and technological developments, which have created a need for alterations in
library school curricula and the establishment of programmes of continuing
education for practising librarians. finally potential developments to meet
the demands of the future are considered.

translation of a paper presented at a 1979 brazilian library science
conference describing the present situation in the usa, where although state
censorship of library collections is minimal, the subject is 1 of great
importance to practising librarians and in library schools. the activities of
the american library association in establishing library and reader rights to
freedom from intervention are described with particular reference to the 1948
library bill of rights and the mccarthy period. in conclusion, reference is
made to the situation in brazil, where the official censorship has changed,
and brazilian librarians warned to guard against any encroachments on library
freedom.

knowledge and censorship; the librarian's responsibilities, his right to make
mistakes, and the notion of service; the ethical and human implications of

translation from the original french. using a methodological framework derived
from recent french research in bibliology and documentology, the dialectics of
the written word and the document are analysed sequentially, by comparing and
contrasting the properties of each in relation to their essential
characteristics; how they function within their respective communication
circuits; marxist sociological theory; and the historical perspective. from
this structural analysis of the 2 entities a scientific synthesis is effected
delimiting the relationship between bibliology and documentology, and the
applications of this theory in the teaching field examined. the analytical
model employed, and its method of construction, is advanced as a working
hypothesis for further criticism, research, and modification.

report of the council session at the ala annual conference, san francisco,
1981, presenting a personal view of council's 'operating agreement between ala
and divisions', currently under revision. new by-laws which set student dues
in divisions at $5.00 and authorise divisions to set up national conferences
generated strong support. this latter decision reflects the impossibility of
joining divisions and round tables of peripheral interest, and its
questionable whether the national or regional conferences will hurt state
conferences in terms of attendance and exhibitors.

contribution to a special feature on the future of associations. in the last
year there has been much concern over 'trouble' at the american library
association hq. ala divisions seek greater participation in the conduct of
their own financial and personal affairs, including the right to determine
their own dues structures and policies, the right to larger allocations from
ala's general fund, and the right to more participation in the selection of
the person hired to represent their interests at ala hq. a proposed 'operating
agreement for ala and its divisions' addresses many of these concerns, and is
the product of discussions between ala hq staff and divisional officers.

american library association and the canadian library association, and places
it in its historical perspective. notes the unparalleled growth of american
and canadian libraries in the 1960s, and identifies the challenges which they
face in the 1980s. libraries in both countries are seen as having to deal with
the problems caused by increased costs for labour and library materials,
coupled with an all over decline in funding, and competition from new
information agencies, from supermarkets and other outlets for commercial
reading, and from viewing and listening materials. discusses the link between
us and canadian library education, and indicates the possible need for a
change in this relationship.

contribution to a special feature on the future of associations. discusses the
relationship between the american library association and the association of
college and reference libraries (later, association of college and research

academic librarians. the ala/acrl relationship has been rocky over the
years-some see it as an equal partnership, others as a parent/adolescent child
relationship. a 1981 summit meeting in chicago suggested several fundamental
changes in the ala at the highest level. these suggestions are investigated in
some detail.

the associations' sections are composed of specialised subject and academic
general libraries with relevant stocks in the subject area concerned. they aim
to develop cooperation, the optimal use of literature, education and exchange
of professional experiences. the technical section is the largest, with 318
members. technical libraries stock mainly modern material; their staff members
are few, their opening hours are restricted and their research results are
often inaccessible to the general public. they are closely connected with a
scientific discipline and provide specific information sources which play
subordinate roles in other libraries. the technical library section is
currently concerned with library and information work in factory combines,
problems of patent literature and library work in technical colleges within
industrial complexes.

outlines the development of professional education for librarianship in canada
from the late 1920s. canada has tended to follow the us pattern and all
canadian library schools still submit their programmes to the american library
association for accreditation. however anyone can call himself a 'professional
librarian' and libraries do not have to hire graduates from accredited
schools. most programmes run for 2 years for a master's degree, the 1st year
full time and the 2nd part time. schools have recently oriented their
programmes away from training in routine techniques and towards education for
planning, administration, the setting of standards, organising political
activity for library support, deployment of human and material resources,
fund-raising and new methods of bibliographic and subject analysis.

comments on a report of the working party on the danish library school issued
by the government's department of administration. the report examines
proposals for changes in the library school act. the proposals concern a
common basic training for librarians, the need for post-graduate training and
the organisation and content of courses. future demand and supply of
librarians are estimated. it is proposed to establish a section for the basic
education and another for the other courses. an education council, appointed
by the ministry of culture, with representatives for all interested
organisations is suggested. research is given higher priority, especially that
leading to development for the fundamental library subjects. the report
recognises the development within information and documentation, but expects
this to take place through change in the priorities of the school's
expenditure on present tasks and sees allocation of additional resources as
politically unrealistic.

contribution to an issue on education for technological university library
work. new aspects of librarianship-changes in cataloguing rules, in use of new
forms of the catalogue, the proliferation of new reference sources, on-line
searching in bibliographic data bases and other innovations-will make use of
university or college libraries by patrons more difficult in the future. the
crucial problem for service librarians is keeping up with these aspects
themselves in order to instruct, inform and assist the user. sharing of
knowledge is suggested as a means for individual librarians to keep up with
new developments; sharing through publications, conferences and workshops,
audio-visual programmes and in-house training sessions.

student studies' society and libraries, knowledge of literature, handling and
distribution of media. in the 2nd year the student has a choice between'
culture-information (ki) and information-documentation (id). ki includes
courses on' library automation and specialist literature; library cooperation
and activities; administration. id includes courses on' language and thought
research; library automation and documentation; administration; knowledge of

extract from a postgraduate dissertation presented at ufmg library school,
brazil. within the discipline of librarianship, user studies are an important
research topic, but there is little systematic study of users in librarianship
curricula. to establish how this important subject area should be treated in
training programmes, an analysis was made of the literature dealing with
users, to establish a theoretical basis for teaching purposes. results showed
that the primary focus was on user behaviour in relation to social and
cultural factors; needs and motivations; and interaction and communication in
the library situation. accordingly, an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on,
for example, psychology, anthropology and sociology, should be adopted.

owing to government economy measures the documentalists' training school must
close by 1893 and the planned course on information and documentation in
darmstadt may not after all begin in 1982, which poses a real threat to all
basic and advanced training courses. there is still dispute over the value of
integrated training courses for librarians and documentalists and as to
whether documentalists should have degree status. information scientists are
the vital link between the public and information produced by an ever widening
range of technological products. a unified training system with good promotion
prospects must be established with degree qualifications for the highest staff
grades. the transition period resulting after the establishment of a new
system will demand further training after a basic qualification has been
obtained.

work. the basic needs for the education of special librarians in new zealand
seem likely to be met by the new courses at the department of librarianship,
victoria university of wellington, and the school of library studies,
wellington teachers' college. there is an 18-week sandwich course at the
college, leading to the n.z. library studies certificate, for untrained
special library staff. the country's main lack would seem to be a properly
organised and coordinated continuing education programme for all librarians.

the pamphlet series developed since 1970, originally for use in correspondence
courses on basic and post-graduate librarianship, but is now used also in
classes at the library school. the humboldt university combines a basic
training for both librarians and documentalists with additional specialist
options; the structure of the basic library school and correspondence courses
is identical. the pamphlets provide an introduction for the student to work
with readers, information work, library stocks, cataloguing, bibliography,
documentation and storage and political studies. the series will expand to
include more detailed monographs on various aspects of librarianship, as has
already happened with a similar series produced in the ussr.

for years now libraries and librarians in bulgaria have been following the
example of their soviet counterparts in the organisation of library and
information services. targets for bulgaria's economic growth, technological
advancement and the population's higher living standard in the 1980s make the
significance of soviet literature and periodicals still more obvious.
concentrating upon concrete tasks and problems in their area, librarians must
supply their readers and others working in local industries, research
institutes, schools and colleges with relevant information. soviet sources,
such as technical periodicals have been most useful in the past and will
continue to be in the future. librarians can rely upon assistance given by the
staff at the house of soviet science and culture in sofia. partnerships with
soviet libraries have also proven valuable. some ventures from the pleven
region (northern bulgaria) are given as examples of successful promotion of
sovi et literature and experience in librarianship among the bulgarian public.

the hopes placed in the 'tuppenny' library in the 1930s were seen to be
short-lived by the 1950s. circulating libraries are defined as those from
which books were borrowed through subscription or small fees paid to the
business concerns providing them. they were primarily for recreational
reading, and agents included harrod's, boots and smaller shops. stock was
bought or obtained through suppliers such as allied libraries in manchester,
who declined in that part of their business, and closed it in 1975, and south
county libraries who supplied to 6,000-7,000 agents after the war, and to less
than 150 in 1978. some agents were reluctant to close, because of customer
relations, while younger shop owners were often uninterested.

in 1973 the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (german research association) made
recommendations about the activities of these libraries within the context of
super-regional library provision. although standards generally have risen
since then, financial difficulties are causing problems. university libraries
have to concentrate on acquiring examination syllabus literature at the
expense of research material. these libraries should be providing topical and
comprehensive information services on their specialised subjects and a
clearing house is needed to sort out the existing jungle of information
sources. current and possible future developments are discussed for'
periodical indexing; subject catalogues of periodicals; subject catalogues of
libraries; current subject bibliographies; and acquisitions lists.

conference in 1899. construction of the palace, which was financed by andrew
carnegie, was begun in 1907 and the building was opened in 1913. the library
of the peace palace serves the permanent court of justice, the united nations
international court of justice and the hague academy of international law, all
of which organisations are situated in the peace palace. the library also
provides a service to external users, including foreign embassy staff,
specialists in international law and industrial lawyers employed by
multinational concerns. the collection contains approximately 580,000 volumes

protestant parish libraries in germany began in the 19th century, partly
through missionary impulses and partly through the development of the school
system. their work was interrupted in the 1930s and began again in 1945, when
walter schwarz and eva lindber refounded the deutsche verband evangelischer
buchereien (german association of evangelical libraries), which has overall
control of the parish libraries, providing advice, organising conferences and
compiling statistics. a library school was founded which had to close in the
1970s through lack of funds. the parish libraries are staffed mainly by
volunteers, for whom short training courses are provided, with professional
staff in top posts. a quarterly periodical is published containing library
news and 1,800 reviews annually of new publications, for one of which an
annual book prize is awarded.

the roman catholic public libraries developed in the 19th century with the
advent of popular education. the libraries are to be found today in hospitals,
and other institutions and in the parishes; their aim is to provide education,
social communication and help for the underprivileged. the largest have stocks
of up to 30,000 items but average totals are between 1,500-5,000 items of
lending and reference material for children and adults. staff are mainly
volunteers, although full-time professionals are employed in the diocesan
centres, responsible for planning and finance, staff training and
representation of library interests within their diocese. overall control is
maintained by st. michael's league in bavaria and by the borromeus association
in the rest of germany, who provide a number of centralised services.

during the last 30 years it has been affirmed that financial support of public
libraries run by the churches is needed at state and national level because
they are public libraries. church public library achievements at this time
include stock increases, the development of staff training and social service
within librarianship. it is disputed as to whether they are religious rather
than public libraries and whether centralised services for them are too
costly. the smaller branches could be regarded as a hindrance to the mobile
libraries and the use of voluntary staff could be an excuse not to employ
full-time administrators. a plurality of library authorities can be regarded
as economic. financial assistance for all public libraries is provided by the
state, especially in places where the church library may be the only public
library.

contribution to an issue devoted to the german librarians conference at
regensburg, 9-13 june 81. protestant public libraries in bavaria are run by
the bavarian branch of the german association of evangelical libraries which
participates in the state library development programme in return for some
financial support. the libraries, open to all, have stocks comparable with
small branch libraries; they are particularly valuable in underprivileged
rural areas where they act as centres for communication and culture. staff are
mainly voluntary workers for whom part-time training courses are arranged. the
association publishes a quarterly information sheet for bavaria and a
quarterly periodical covering the whole of germany. the bavarian branch
maintains a central library of 29,000 volumes to supplement small library
stocks, organising block loans to them and to other interested bodies such as
youth clubs and organisers of retirement courses.

diocesan centre and the state library centre provides a number of centralised
services and overall administration. the league publishes a reviewing journal
jointly with the borromeus association, a quarterly information sheet on
library activities in bavaria, book lists and a handbook for the use of the
staff, mainly volunteers, for whom short training courses are provided. close
cooperation is maintained with local government. since 1968 the league has
compiled annual statistics by electronic data processing; the programme is

1979, in the whole of bavaria, the league controlled 1,273 libraries stocking
over 3 million media; loans totalled over 6 million, with over 6,000 staff,
mainly volunteers. the parish libraries are controlled by diocesan centres
which employ professional, fulltime staff, provide advice for smaller
libraries and arrange staff training programmes. the diocesan centres are in
turn subordinate to the state administrative centre in munich, which is
responsible for organising central purchasing and interloans and publishing a

extended and improved. there are more qualified staff employed and better
staff training programmes than before. audio-visual media, publicity work and
the regional inter-loan system have become more prominent. more reference

sweden's public library network is well developed and reaches large groups of
the population through its outreach activities. recent studies show that
almost &h the adult population and 80-90% of the children and young people
have visited a library in the last year. modern developments have accelerated
during the 1970s largely because of the fusion of local authorities. sweden
has no libraries act, but the swedish parliament decided to introduce a system
of state grants to public libraries and regional library activities. state
grants amount to 2.5% of the total operating costs of public libraries, but
they have played a large role in the development of libraries thanks to their
strategic deployment.

describes a visit to mexico and the us financed benjamin franklin library in
guadelajara briefly. the children's library attached to the 'centro social
morelos' in aguascalientes suffers from lack of space and material, and the
unqualified librarian's main duty is to keep order. few public libraries lend
books. the stream of pulp magazines and comics for adults and children is now
being countered by the state, who publishes material in similar style, but
better content. the library in san cristobal receives money for staff salaries
but none for books. like other libraries, biblioteca de mexico is used mainly
by students. the public library service came on a more organised footing in
1978, and as no school libraries exist, creation of children's sections is
receiving priority. there is great demand for the librarians trained at the 6
universities but many are attracted into private firms. continuity of library
planning is hampered by the changes of  central administration every 6 years.

lecture given at the 29th conference of state library centres in west germany,
burghausen, sept 81. basic provision of stocks and staff is still not as good
in rural as in urban areas; further financial provision from the state is
necessary if library services are to be improved. plans for improving bavarian
libraries are linked closely with national development schemes. every village
with over 3,000 inhabitants has a branch library and smaller villages are
served by mobile libraries, more of which are still needed. closure of many
small branch libraries has resulted in a concentration of services and in
increased stocks and readership. cooperation between public and school
libraries and between local authority and church public libraries is very
important.

the vestmannaeyjar public library has had to struggle against poverty, lack of
understanding, and ultimately to struggle for survival. a long-standing
struggle for proper library premises has taken place; the library, having few
means, was moved from 1 temporary place to another until it could be moved
into a new building in 1970. in feb 73 a volcanic eruption hit the heimaey and
destroyed the library, but the books were rescued. it is thought the library

questions the need for workplace libraries in sweden vis-a-vis provision of
public and branch libraries. in fact, almost 2/3 of the swedish population do
not regularly use their local municipal library-they have not discovered the
library as an intellectual resource, or as a source of pleasure and emotional
experience. suggests the benefits which library use can afford the population,
and sees the paucity of usage as a warning signal to school staff, popular
educationists and trade unions.

skamokawa, a village of 250 population, in washington's 2nd smallest county,
wahkiakum, has, in the last few years, gained a library. the nucleus of the
collection came from the local school, but the library now boasts a book
collection, paperbacks, interlibrary loan services, a film borrowing service,
and a reference service. volunteers provide remedial reading, tutoring, and
instruction in french. the library is dependent on donated funds, and
fund-raising is an ever present chore. volunteer help is erratic and lack of
time has prevented the librarian from cataloguing the collection. the library
succeeds, ultimately, through community determination, and, operating on the
premise that something is better than nothing, cares for the individual by
providing what is really wanted by the population it serves.

mobile library service characteristics and practices differ widely in rural
scotland with no 1 authority adhering rigidly to any standard. where and when
a mobile stops are important factors in its use. as most visits are on
weekdays between 9.00 am and 5.00 pm, more women than men use the service.
most users live within 1/4 of a mile of a stopping point. the service is
greatly valued by users valued by users although it is generally inferior to a
static branch. nevertheless, urgent study is required to identify rural
dwellers' needs so that the appropriate service can be provided.

each department is controlled by a subject specialist responsible for stocks,
cataloguing, advisory and information work, organisation, staff training and
coordination with industry and other interested bodies. in suhl there are
subject specialists for science and technology, social science, children's
books, earth sciences and music. such demanding posts require university
graduates with detailed bibliographic knowledge and an additional
qualification in librarianship. it might also be possible to obtain subject

libraries in higher education must make the most of their existing premises as
construction of new library buildings has been severely restricted, at least
for the time being. however, in spite of the conditions, library and
information services must be under constant review with their improvement in
mind. branches established in the students' halls of residence have to provide
all students with basic study literature. the central library of any
particular establishment has to cater for centralised and coordinated
acquisitions and processing. use of literature by students and teaching staff
must also be followed up and obsolete items discarded. greater attention must
be paid to political and other literature dealing with social sciences,
especially in faculties of applied science. it is important to support
aesthetic education by audio-visual materials. the role of computerised
information systems, now on a trial basis in schools of econ omics, will grow
in future. for expert advice libraries in higher education have to look above
all to the university library in sofia with its methodological department and
special councils in many spheres of knowledge.

the period in question saw a rapid growth in us academic libraries which
reached a peak around 1974. localised library automation was abandoned in
favour of cooperative networks and at the same time there was the rise of the
phenomenon of on-line data base reference services such as dialog.
considerable attention was given to the development of multi-media learning
resources centres. library administration became less hierarchical in the
early 1970s with more trade union involvement in evidence. the worsening
economic situation after 1974 left its mark with the drying up of library
vacancies and noticeable pressure on library resources.

books were first transferred to the new christ church library building in
peckwater quadrangle in the period 1763-70. the post of library keeper was
filled by a senior member of the college. initially the library only served
senior members of the college. in 1869 a library committee was established to
oversee the purchase of books and the compiling and updating of catalogues. an
undergraduate reading room was set up apart from the main building in 1884 and
existed until 1929. problems arising from inefficiency and a lack of space
gave rise to a major reorganisation of the library's resources in the 1930s.
at the present time new accessions currently run to about 900 volumes and 160
pamphlets per annum. all members of the college now have access to the library

when the university of uppsala was re-established in the 1620s by king
gustavus adolphus, a well-equipped university library was seen as an important
pre-requisite. the library was moved several times, and in 1638 a permanent
post of librarian was created. the book collection was arranged by faculty,
and systematic indices were produced. student were not allowed to borrow books
for home reading, although professors could do so, and professors often stood
bail for those who defaulted on the restrictions. librarians were chosen from
amongst the university's most renowned professors. ultimately, considerable
cataloguing work was carried out, fixed hours were established, and the
library's lending policy became more liberal.

describes the library of the danish library school. the library is the
country's main subject library for librarianship and with 90,000 volumes and
1,500 journals contains 1 of the world's largest collections of such
literature. it employs 4 librarians and 4 assistants. its main purpose is to
serve the school, but external activities are to be given higher priority.
thus 2bibliotek 701 is to publish information brought to its attention by the
library. an archive of posters, regulations, plans, films, tapes, documents,
letters and pictures is planned. a project jointly with other nordic library
schools involving the development of a data base of nordic literature on
libraries, documentation and information began in 1979. on-line searches are
possible on the library's new computer terminal.

from jan 81 jonstrup teacher training college has had a professional library
service in conjunction with lyngby public library. a librarian from the
library has been stationed at, and paid by, the college since oct 80. a
library committee of teaching staff, students and librarians was set up to
analyse the college's needs as regards library services in general and a
project due to start in 1981 in particular. it was agreed that a large
centrally placed library was needed for staff and students, that lyngby
library would make about 10% of annual accessions ready for lending, and that
library staff would be available 4 hours daily. the present stock was to be
examined for possible withdrawal or retention and registration. extra staff
was secured for the organisation of the library and transfer of material from
the special subject areas to the library.

a portrait of peter frederik suhm, 1728-98, author of a history of denmark. he
opened his private library in his house in central copenhagen to the public
and people from all spheres of life used it. little is known of this library
as catalogues, correspondence, invoices and records of borrowings were lost.
although 1 of suhm's librarians, r. nyerup, was a prolific author, he never
wrote about the library. with 100,000 volumes, it was larger than the
university library. suhm spent 5 times as much on his library as the
government spent on the royal library, not yet open to the public, and paid
for it with his wealthy wife's money. 2 years before his death the library was
sold to the royal library.

are today 500 factory libraries with specially appointed staff and 2,000 with
unmanned book collections. outlines the history of workplace libraries,
beginning with eugene varlin's library opened in 1852. from 1870-1914,
libraries became attached to the labour exchanges. the largest library today
is at the renault factory outside paris, with 25,000 employees, of whom 1/3
are immigrants. the modern history of factory libraries begins here, with the
opening of the main library in 1950 after factory committees had been
appointed. the main library has 60,000 volumes and employs 5 librarians.

the concept of the 'workplace' library-a swedish advance-has attracted much

of the swedish labour market, however, has for many years enjoyed a smoothly
functioning public library service. the swedish seamen's library serves the

a mobile library service is only likely to have to cater for ethnic minorities
in urban areas. after the local ethnic minorities have been identified a
reasonable stock of books in the appropriate languages must be included
bearing in mind that several ethnic minorities are english-speaking e.g. west
indians. stocks of books for ethnic minorities must perforce be limited since
ethnic minorities also read books originating from the dominant culture' a
surfeit would also alienate the non-ethnic minority users. the problem of

in areas with large numbers of immigrant residents have provided material in
the immigrants' native languages. at national level the nederlands bibliotheek
en lektuur centrum (dutch centre for libraries and literature) set up a
committee on public library services for immigrant workers in jan 78. the

in 1981 a new post with special responsibility for services to foreign workers

utrecht has almost 20,000 immigrants, mainly from the poorer mediterranean
countries and the new post was the result of a report published in 1980 on the
provision of library services to immigrant workers. the report recognised the
difficulties in providing such services and recommended enlisting the aid of
immigrant workers in selecting, obtaining and processing material for the
library. to publicise its services the library is endeavouring to contact
local organisations concerned with the social and cultural welfare of
immigrant families and to give presentations on the library's servives at

attended in helsinki. defines bibliometrics as quantitative measurement of
library techniques. bibliometric methods can be used on a global scale, but
they can also be a tool to calculate the best use of an individual library's
resources. among the empirical laws developed, bradford's law is the most
applicable. describes the use of this law to obtain a graph with an
exponentially increasing part, a so-called bradford graph. this can show the
relationship between authors and number of articles, articles and quotations
and can help to determine the process of obsolescence of literature in a
library. other bibliometric laws are those of lotka and zipf. the methods are
useful in acquisition, planning of space allocation, withdrawals, library use,
and other areas of library administration.

binomial and 2 forms of the lotka distribution are compared with the observed
distributions of author productivity, using the chi squared and
kolmogorov-smirnov goodness-of-fit tests. the journal productivity programs

reply to an article by e.j. groeskamp in bibliotheek en samenleving 9 (12) dec
81, 333-337 (for an abstract of which 2see1 82/4167), in which attention was
drawn to the hidden censorship practised by public libraries. groeskamp's
definition of censorship should more properly be termed 'rejection on ethical
grounds'. because of lack of space and financial resources, libraries cannot
purchase all books published and selection is necessary to obtain a balanced
collection of material. the facts on which groeskamp's arguments are based
include 2 library surveys, of which 1 contained insufficient data to draw any
firm conclusions, while the other produced results in conflict with
groeskamp's deductions. for financial reasons it is to be expected that in a
community of 1 religious persuasion few books of a different persuasion are
likely to be found in the local public library.

the 2nd international conference of toy libraries in stockholm 1981 included
papers, lectures, workshops, an extensive toy exhibition, and visits to
hospitals, day nurseries, clinics, preschools and toy libraries. apart from
loaning toys, a toy library aims to advise and stimulate through play,
particularly to deprived families. visits (in sweden) are by appointment and
doctor's referral. toys are selected according to the child's current needs.
siblings are involved. countries especially supporting toy libraries include
denmark, sweden, the netherlands, iceland, uk and italy. public libraries are

the growth of toy libraries in australia has been rapid and extensive during

their role of serving handicapped children and their families. the aim of the
study is to help overcome this lack of information and be of assistance to
policy makers and those developing services which impinge on areas in which
toy libraries are presently involved.

the videogram commission's report suggests that libraries should be
distribution centres for a broad supply of good quality video recordings, but
video has already become a mass market article supplied through international
distribution channels and libraries have little chance of making an impact. a
working group of representatives of cultural institutions, the vidmo-group,
was formed already in 1973; it hoped to start experiments in libraries with
production and showing of videograms, but trade union opposition meant that
the swedish broadcasting corporation's programmes could not be used. other
reports have appeared pointing to the advantages of libraries as distributors
of video, but without state financial support public libraries will never be
able to fulfil this role. some areas are, however, open to libraries, provided
they cooperate with each other and other organisations' videograms for the
deaf and other handicapped; videograms produced  directly for the medium by
artists and media workshops; videograms for children; for education in
cooperation with the educational radio and the av centre; and locally produced
material for video.

contribution to an issue devoted to public library services in sweden.
sweden's public libraries are basically operated by the local authorities. the
state can provide grants to level out standards but does not interfere in the
running of local libraries, and sweden has no libraries act. municipal
authorities themselves decide the objectives, scale and structure of their
library services. all of sweden's 279 municipalities provide municipal library
services. certain library functions would be too expensive to operate on a
purely municipal basis-it is therefore rational and efficient to transfer
these to the regional or supramunicipal-that is, county-level.

in the netherlands there has been much discussion in recent years on the
transfer of school library services from the public library service to the
responsibility of the local education authorities. in the present situation of
cutbacks in public library finances there is considerable support for such a
transfer. however, school librarians employed by the public library
authorities, are as much a part of the school 'support' staff as educational
psychologists and social workers also found in schools. librarians experienced
in the provision of children's library services are in the best position to
organise school libraries with their growing collections of audio-visual
materials as well as their bookstock.

the recent communist party congress and requirements of the 7th 5-year-plan
(1981-85) have given a new impetus to the whole library network in slovakia.
since 1 jan 82, a special section of matica slovenska, based in bratislava,
has been in operation. its staff have to watch, direct and control both short-
and long-term planning in libraries. they will also care for coordination
between libraries and centres of scientific, technical and economic
information. contacts with libraries in the czech socialist republic as well
as international connections will also be furthered. the overall
responsibility for libraries, however, rests upon the slovak ministry of
culture. for their part, the ministry's officials will make every effort
towards unification and/or standardisation of all library activities,
including building up book collections, records, statistics and the like.
among other problems which must be tackled in  the forseeable future are
computerisation, mergers of public and school libraries, where appropriate,
and incorporation of public libraries into local cultural institutions.

revised version of a paper presented to a meeting on regional library
cooperation in deventer, 19 nov 81. in the netherlands cooperation amongst
libraries of all types has come under close examination as a result of the
inclusion of public library services in the proposed public services act. the
concept of library networks dates from the early 1900s when the need for
libraries to share their resources was recognised. the most effective library
networks are those networks which operate their services on a financial basis.
in addition, the coordination of acquisition policies, cataloguing services
and interlibrary lending amongst members of a library network requires the
most up-to-date telecommunication and computer equipment. within each network
a central library should be designated to act as a clearing-house for the
transfer of information.

for over 10 years public libraries have been buying more academic literature
than before and university libraries offering the use of their facilities to
people outside the university. this extra-mural work must not be reduced
because of financial problems; the obvious need for academic material must be
satisfied and inter-library loans and purchasing schemes must result in a
better coordinated and more economical use of literature. the building up of
union catalogues using electronic data processing and of decentralised
microfiche and screen text services will ease the demand on university special
collections. isolation of university libraries will not improve their public
image and could prove costly.

in the library system of east germany, the university libraries of berlin,

group provides advice on organisation, with particular reference to the
development of the unified system of a central university library with
associated branches and promotes exchanges and analyses of experience. the
group is currently concentrating on inter-library cooperation within subject
networks, with a view to imrpoving purchasing policy. improvements must also
be made in the cooperation between university libraries, information centres
and research, in user training and in the application of technology.

text of an interview with hans de boer, minister for culture, recreation and

services act which will decentralise running of the public services, including
public libraries, from national to local government level. de boer believes
that involvement of the local community in the running of these services is
the best guarantee for improving the quality of the service. plans for
extending the age limit for free public library membership from 16 to 18 years
of age have been abandoned by de boer because of financial cutbacks in
government support. the alternative, de boer believes, would have been a

text of an interview with dr. j.j. postma, chairman of the nblc on the 10th

the netherlands should now come to terms with the new public services act,
which will replace the existing public libraries act. by refusing to accept
the act librarians are in danger of being left out in the cold. in postma's
view the danger of the new act lies in the devolution of responsibility for
the public services, including public libraries, from national to local
government. in some local authorities, he adds, town festivals may receive
greater priority than the library service. the nblc must convince the
government of the need for an information act which includes the public
library service. (for an abstract of part 1, 2see1 82/5007).

were present. reports of these meetings were circulated to all heads of
departments. in 1975 following the opening of a new central library the
library service was reorganised into 8 departments and a new structure of
staff meetings was introduced. in addition to the meetings attended by
administrative staff and heads of departments, all staff of the internal
services meet every 3 weeks, while staff of the external services meet each
week. the purpose of these meetings is to improve staff motivation and thereby
the quality of the library's services.

in the bill for a new danish library act, which will shortly be tabled in the
folketing, the clause regarding a free library service will, it seems, be
retained. questions whether the parties who believe that a charge should be
levied for library use will manage to influence the final form of the act. if
the principle of a free service goes by the board, every idea of an equal
service to all will go by the board with it, with the consequent bad effect on
publishing houses, bookshops and authors.

iscusses the economic cuts as they affect the library services. the
government's savings circular recommended that local authorities cut library
expenditure to 185 kr per capita, as, it was argued, public libraries showed
signs of uncontrolled growth. the librarians' union has, however, calculated
public libraries' real growth in 1980 as within the government's recommended
3%; this is supported by the library inspectorate. the figures for 1981
indicate an average fall in real growth of 1.4%. the librarians' union has
examined the local effects of cuts and found that fringe services like
outreach activities are worst hit and that staff appointments are frozen. the
government's technocrats have drawn up models for the development of the
public sector, but librarians' answer must be that the development of the
library part of this sector is not a technical matter only, but that cultural
aspects are equally important.

.I 5708

4 members of the librarians' union's working party on savings were asked to
evaluate the library situation in view of the cuts in expenditure. they
discussed the figures relating to running costs, staff and material costs
produced by the library inspectorate and the effects of cuts on work loads and
loans. views differed as to whether minimum norms should be laid down. they
agreed that the union as a central organisation could do little to give
guidelines for action in local situations. some thought members should refuse
to take part in local working groups on savings set up to give priorities to
cuts in different areas, as this was tantamount to condoning cuts, others
thought useful information could be gained from participation and that local
librarians should present politicans with well argued budget proposals and
outline effects of particular cuts.

public service satellite consortium conducted a survey of academic libraries,
in 1980, to study their data communications needs and services. 'cable
libraries' (catvlib) were identified as libraries connected to local cable
companies. a 2nd study aimed to determine to what extent a national satellite
cable library network might already be in technical existence; how many
libraries are presently connected to cooperative cable companies with
satellite hardware and excess satellite receiver capacity and of that number,
how many cable libraries would be interested in participating in
satellite-assisted library services and teleconferencing.

discusses the ideas of cobabus and thiem on the relationship between
automation and' (1) productivity; (2) product quality; (3) staff
qualifications and training, and the effects of governmental restrictions on
expenditure upon these relationships. automation in libraries tends to lag
behind automation in other fields but it demands changes in staff training,
intellectualisation of production work and a new relationship between public
and academic libraries. processes previously separated can be integrated by
automation. before automation there was a tendency towards rigidity in the
higher staff grades; now automation requires changes in the staff hierarchy
and the old idea of the 'classical librarian'.

in the netherlands supporters of the introduction of automated systems in
library service point to the computerised loans systems already in operation
in libraries in rotterdam, amsterdam and elsewhere, and to the growing number
of libraries making use of computerised cataloguing networks. opponents of
automation point to the social implications of the replacement of man by
machines. a further group suggests that the use of automation in libraries
depends on the nature of the work to be done and asserts that certain
technical aids, such as the telephone and the photocopier, are regarded as
essential to a library's services. in spite of unemployment it is becoming
increasingly difficult to attract and retain staff for certain tasks in
libraries. in such cases automation can be of great assistance.

paper presented at the conference of cooperative librarians & documentation
officers, moscow, oct 80. since 1976 an automated system has been under
development in the state public scientific and technical library of the ussr,

services. it is also planned to automate the maintenance of a card index of
readers, and card indexes of particular reference solutions. it is felt that
the automation will substantially increase the library's efficiency.

contribution to an issue devoted to education for technological university
library work. gives a short historical review of formal qualifications
required of applicants to qualified librarians' posts in swedish academic
libraries. shows how new developments in education and research as well as in
library techniques have affected conditions of work in a library. new tasks
have been added to the traditional ones, and it is necessary to find ways of
reconciling the new development with existing library expertise, and to find a
common dominator which will work towards an integration of all tasks in a
library. this is found in the overall aims for library work' to meet the needs
of the customer. instruction and training on how best to meet the users' needs
should therefore form an important part of all education for librarianship.

describes a study undertaken to ascertain to what extent academic librarians
in nigeria satisfy the bibliographical and information requirements of
scholarship and research, and whether the institutional settings in which
staff work are conducive to effective professional service. among major
elements examined were the librarians' perceptions of their responsibilities;
their academic and professional backgrounds; work environments; job
satisfaction and opportunities for continuing education and professional
development. it was found that professional library service has been hindered
by the inability of the library administrators to conceptualise the proper
role of a librarian; rigid bureaucratisation in the libraries; failure to
separate professional from non-professional duties; and by limited incentives
and opportunities for continuing education and professional growth.

in recent years training for the higher staff grades has undergone a
fundamental reform. the number of library school graduates working in academic
libraries has now increased. formerly, although all staff in academic
libraries possessed university degrees, few of them possessed qualifications
in librarianship. in public libraries, by contrast, most senior staff have
librarianship qualifications. the new situation has been caused by legal
changes, the final results of which cannot be predicted with certainty. at
present there is a wide variety of courses available; the best balance of
theoretical and practical training must be chosen. further consideration must
be given to the joint training of librarians and documentalists and to the
salaries of library school staff.

contribution to a special feature on the future of associations. nla was
founded in 1975 to meet a long-felt need in many librarians for a national
professional association which would concern itself exclusively with librarian
issues rather than with the entire gamut of issues related to libraries in
society. nla is small, new and not well understood. the usa has 100,000
librarians, but nla has only 500 members. no library publication has reported
on or evaluated nla's position papers on a nationwide system of certification
for librarians and on professional welfare. library schools tend to ignore
nla's offers to provide speakers or information materials. in many ways nla
has achieved a great deal, but it stands at a critical point in its
development. it may be that directly addressing 'bread and butter' issues will
provide the impetus nla needs to regain its movement toward becoming a major
national association for libraria ns.

in many large municipal libraries there are unqualified staff in specialist
posts who have been unable for various reasons to study for professional
qualifications. since 1979 potsdam research library has organised special
in-service training courses for them, including general surveys of
librarianship and public libraries in particular and specialist training in
the work of their own departments. at the end of the 12 months' course each
student receives a certificate of participation. it is essential for staff to
have preliminary discussions with prospective students to give them
information about the course and to get from them a promise to work hard.
experience has shown that most students find the course helpful. this type of
course can only be provided in a large library system.

the library of the de voorst hydraulics laboratory in the noordoostpolder in

the library contained over 20,000 documents, annual loans totalled almost
10,000 and the collection had long outgrown the original library building. in
1975 plans had already been drawn up for a new library with a working area of
200 sq.m. together with a further 200 sq.m. of underground storage area for
archival material. the public, staff and bookstack areas were planned to
provide the most efficient layout for readers and staff and removal of the

at a time of rapidly rising energy costs energy-consciousness has become a
necessity in the construction of new library buildings. at mierlo in the
netherlands a new public library was opened in nov 81. by the insertion of
extra insulation in the floor, walls and roof, and the most efficient use of
heat generated by the artificial lighting it is expected that heating costs
for the library will be 1/3 of the normal amount for buildings of similar
dimensions. in addition, the use of prefabricated parts in the construction of
the library enabled the building to be completed in 22 weeks with a consequent
saving in labour costs.

on 14 dec 80, a new branch library was opened at katwijk in the netherlands.
during the planning stages it was felt that a building with a public function,
such as a public library, should set an example in energy saving. to maximise
natural energy from the sun the building has been constructed with a large
area of glass in the south-east wall; the warmth generated by this means is
retained in the stone north wall and the floor. the building is equipped with
triple-glazing and heat-insulating blinds which close automatically at night
and reopen each morning. it is expected that the savings in energy costs will
be in the region of 50%. it is to be hoped that other libraries in the
netherlands will follow this example.

at present libraries in bulgaria, as elsewhere, have to compete with mass
media, in particular with television. migration of young people to towns
hampers expansion of libraries in rural areas. people buy more books and use
public libraries less than in the past. in spite of this as well as some other
negative factors, interest in reading has increased recently and the
population's leisure time activities have become more balanced. thus the staff
in local public and central regional libraries have to plan carefully to
attract new readers. all ages and social groups must be catered for. in

reproduction of paintings, must be more fully used.

a practical discussion of the public library's role as an agent for social and

design services to meet local needs and interests; here, contact with local

manifestly relevant and efficient, and geared not only to existing users but
also to non-users. emphasises that the library's priority is to counteract
general public apathy by bold initiatives; suggests various strategies for
drawing public attention, and concludes with a detailed plan for organising a

1977 and cooperation with libraries established. the report on 'local
participatory democracy' stimulated the development of public information
services in libraries. the 'kommune-information' at the town library of
lyngby-taarbaek was set up in 1977. it is placed close to the reference room
and staffed by 1 full-time librarian. close cooperation with the town hall
exists and contact persons in each department were appointed. all material
automatically sent to kommune-information is catalogued and displayed and some
may be borrowed. an informatio n index of local items is being built up.
around 400 enquiries a month are dealt with, some by reference to the relevant
department, others directly, concerning' decisions made, rights and duties,
on-going projects, local groups and societies. despite the need few other
local authorities have followed this example.

in czechoslovakia, centres of scientific, technical and economic information
are at present in operation not only in design centres and research
institutes, but also in all larger factories. the core of such a centre is the
technical library. in most libraries, periodicals and monographs still
prevail, but lately patents, standards, dissertations, research reports, trade
catalogues and documentary films are available. the centres' activities
depend, of course, very much on staff and equipment. building up data and
documentation bases, under exploration of internal and external resources, is
of primary importance. translations, especially those from foreign languages
into slovak and czech are also available. information users are taught to use
information sources more efficiently and effectively. in addition to other
relevant activities, including their own continuing education, information
scient ists and other staff should engage in theoretical studies and research,
the results of which should be published wherever possible.

technical information, with particular reference to the effectiveness of the
alsace regional agency for scientific and technical information (arist) in
meeting the needs of small businesses. details are given of the various
organisations and institutions in the region involved in scientific and
technical information and their activities, showing the tendency to overlap
and duplicate services, and the failure to provide 2a priori1 information to
assist users to anticipate developments. proposals are then presented for
improving services through linking the various organisations concerned, so
that by pooling technical and economic information, developments can be
predicted, and programmes of strategic intervention developed for business
interests affected.

information service; provision of specialised scientific, technical, and
economic documents on a given subject; preparation of analytical reports
summarising all aspects of a particular problem, involving consultation with
specialists and special research; and a comprehensive service to assist firms
in diversification and development. invites criticism of the techniques

there is ample record that information handling occupies a high percentage of
production time and that poor performance in this field is at the root of many
of the industry's problems. such problems fall into 2 main categories. the 1st
relates to buildings themselves and concerns physical (collapse, fire, leaks,
condensation) and spatial (short life, tight fit, high energy) failure. the
2nd category concerns organisational failures. clearly improvements in both
these categories could be beneficial.

contribution to an issue devoted to education for technological university
library work. traditionally, there are 5 basic functions which the library and
librarianship perform for society-archival, cultural, educational,
recreational and informational. unfortunately, library education, while giving
lip-service to the other functions, has remained preoccupied with the archival
activities. proposes a theoretical model of information transfer. the
respective roles of librarians, information scientists and information
managers are identified within this model in the context of the 5 functions
discussed above. implications for curriculum design are discussed.
recommendations for programmes of study based on a common core, but with
distinct areas of specialisation for students training for the 3 professional
fields, are presented.

restrictions on its social availability and use. information is becoming a
market commodity, the information resource base itself shifting from the
public to the private sector which sets to maintain proprietary control of its
products and services leading to increasing restrictions on access. discusses

developments in telecommunications, the question of relations between
government and commercial interests, the role of information in
administration, and the social and cultural issues involved. recent us
contributions to the literature predicting future developments in the

contrast with the smaller, government-based organisation planned for west
germany. the us economic climate lends itself to experiment better than the
european. the us market for literature reference data bases has reached
saturation point and the main growth areas are in factographic and full text

introduction to an occasional series on use instructions in academic
libraries. bibliographic instruction is teaching students how to find
information efficiently and effectively in the modern library. instituting
bibliographic instruction programmes permits students to do better work, to be
more independent in their work and to have more motivation. this allows
assignments to be more varied and expectations can be higher. bibliographic
instruction also helps to insure that the collection is well used-an important
argument when cost effectiveness is a prime consideration in all
administrative decisions.

and the establishment of a clearinghouse for ideas and materials dealing with
bibliographic instruction.

a discussion relating recent literature in english and spanish to the
brazilian situation, where this field has been largely neglected. the main
objective of such programmes is to train children how to use libraries, and
acquaint them with the services available; here the role of the librarian in
presenting the library as a place for both leisure and study is crucial.
training programmes are presented, for both new users and older children, and
teaching methods which can be integrated into the school curriculum suggested.
finally, surveys techniques for evaluating progress and in conclusion
emphasises the importance of library training for the child's future social
and professional development.

the school librarian should take the initiative in the teaching of information
and research skills to pupils without subject bias. getting to know pupils is
important so that the appropriate service can be offered. regular library
visits for 1st-year pupils are especially valuable and are best done by
timetabling a library lesson that is not attached to a particular subject
area. thereafter visits can be organised as required but the need for a more
structured approach is often felt by the start of the 4th year. it is
important too that the teaching staff have research and information skills and
these can be developed by the librarian.

school children need to learn how to use libraries and what is available in a
library. surveys were carried out to find out what literature children read.
based on the results of these surveys a course for teaching children
techniques for the use of libraries was developed. the course consisted of
classwork' analysing favourite books, discovering the contents list, preface,
title, publisher etc. and visits to libraries. during library visits the
children worked in groups with given tasks. through asking librarians and
others they were to discover various means of finding books. they were also
encouraged to find out how a library is organised, what lending conditions are
and what training a librarian needs. the groups compared their results in
classwork.

recommended publishing standards. data collected by the university of parana
library school was used to analyse coverage by bibliographies and union
catalogues published over the decade 1970-80; results showed that local
librarians were chiefly responsible for the creation of bibliographic tools,
while publishers generally disregarded their obligations. recommends stricter

a practical discussion based on published material, conversation with
librarians, and library visits. considers the importance of cultural
activities for developing social and cultural values, and the methods and
techniques available; the objectives in relation to conventional public
library activities; planning procedures, with a full guide for implementing a
programme; the human, material, economic and institutional resources required;
evaluation techniques, to be modified as circumstances dictate; and programmes
for adults, children, and young people, giving a wide range of suggested
activities for each group. finally examines the reasons why latin america has
largely failed to develop programmes in this field, and gives example of
projects successfully initiated in colombia at 3 libraries, including the
national library.

the original purpose of programming (the offering on non-book activities in
public libraries) has been forgotten by many librarians, but has been
justified in several ways. advocates that the commonest method is not to
justify it at all; in many cases programming is ineffective, and little
rigorous evaluation has ever been undertaken to prove that programming can
succeed. questions the common unthinking acceptance of the need for
programming, and cites annual reports and studies which indicate the need for
better evaluation than has heretofore been the practice.

cabell county public library's summer reading programme 'summer of fun' and
other programmes, organised with the cooperation of huntington's public
television station, wpby, reached over 500 young people from pre-school age to
young adults in 1981. young people showed a willingness to be guided and
sustained by personal interest rather than inducements such as awards or
certificates. it was evident that reading can lead to the development of other
skills, as well as being stimulating in itself. evaluation of the 1981
programme will be used in the planning of the 1982 format.

publicity work places great demands upon a special library. leipzig music
library works closely with music publishers, schools, youth clubs, the
university and the national association of composers and musicologists and is
developing links with the local theatre and music schools. this results in
cooperative organisation and finance for musical activities, justified because
of the value of live performances and the use of a wide range of public
library material. there is good publicity for the music library's stock of
140,000 items including some valuable 1st editions. agreements with composers
and publishers result in the provision of information on new publications and
1st performances and in a rational use of money. publication exchanges are
especially useful. through cooperation with the university, music
librarianship training can be provided for staff.

technical reports are a valuable resource of scientific and technical
information which has been allowed to slip into less than maximum utility.
while the processing of more traditional information sources has progressed
and remarkably improved through such mechanisms as shared cataloguing and
on-line access to huge files of cataloguing data, the corresponding processing
of technical reports has remained relatively stagnant. some efforts at
coordinating the processing of reports have been made by the 4 us federal
agencies responsible for the largest report collections. additional efforts
suggested include study of a common report format, more extensive shared
processing of federal documents and increased efforts towards cooperation in
the federal library network.

an average cost of $7.00 per book copy and $12.20 per non-print copy is
developed, and it is demonstrated through a range of costs that ordering
patterns (i.e., single copies, multiple copies, new titles, added titles) make
a significant impact on unit costs. an organisational chart showing staffing

based on the author's participation in an overseas librarians course at leeds
polytechnic school of librarianship in 1979. examines the advantages and
disadvantages of the lockheed dialog on-line system and comments favourably on
automated circulation control. various types of computerised cataloguing
networks such as blaise and mass are discussed. multi media resource centres
are being developed at many higher education institutes in the uk and can be
considered as worthwhile long-term investments but there are numerous problems
associated with the new media such as poor bibliographic control and selection

implementing automated library networks in the caribbean, in relation to the
actual social, political and economic circumstances. the discussion covers the
role of technology in promoting development; the need for and likelihood of
cooperation among the caribbean states; the probable impact of new technology
imported from the developed world; and the ability of caribbean libraries to
implement automated programmes and adapt to them. concludes that the oclc type
network model is not suitable for the caribbean situation, requiring too great
an investment without concrete evidence that the physical, political and
social obstacles to cooperation could be overcome. recommends instead a
detailed investigation of library and telecommunication resources, with a view

australia's emerging australian bibliographic network (abn) system. the
proposed service for access to bibliographical data conforming to national
standards is essential to the effective economic development of the nation's
libraries but it should be operated in such a manner as to encourage, maintain
and support various networks and services, both those already existing and
those that may be established in the future, in the library community and in
the private sector. clann's role should be focussed on making the operation of
the national system and of local services as effective as possible in meeting

since the 1960s the centralisation of stock processing and advisory work on
book selection has demanded rationalisation methods in library organisation.
the use of purchasing key codes in dresden's large municipal library system is
described. in a collective purchasing decision each participant can use the
key to make decisions for the whole network; thus individual responsibility
for literature provision becomes greater. using a key also ensures balanced
stock proportions throughout the whole network and takes into account demands
for time saving and for improved stock quality, thus offering an optimal
solution for unifying stocks in a territorial network.

much attention is being paid at present to stock-building problems, including
the distribution of material within a public library network. working out
stock-building principles can be time-consuming and this is only one aspect of
stock-building, even if it is the most important. a purchasing key is a coding
system for the practical application of these principles; experiences in
magdeburg have proved the key to be a useful rationalisation method. through
the coding symbols the librarian can see quickly what types of literature are
in which libraries in the network. the symbols are flexible and can easily be
kept up to date. other stock-building criteria are literary merit, specialist
demand, functions of individual libraries in the network, numbers of readers,
space and money.

contribution to an issue devoted to the german librarians conference,
regensburg, 9-13 june 81. at regensburg university a central acquisitions
department coordinates orders received from the central and subject libraries
and controls all pre-accession work, finance and budgeting. a balance of
centralised and decentralised tasks proves successful. the central
acquisitions department finds information on domestic and foreign literature
and sends this to the subject librarians. literature selection is made jointly
by the subject librarians and the faculties. the subject librarian traces
missing bibliographic details for the acquisitions department. german language
material is bought from local book-sellers, foreign material from a variety of
sources; gifts, exchanges and deposit copies also provide useful material.
periodicals are obtained mainly through direct ordering.

faced with cuts in book budgets, librarians have to choose to which groups of
users they should give priority' those who use the library most, i.e. those
with higher education, or the minority for whom the need for meaningful
activities beyond tv and weekly magazines in a time of unemployment is great.
fears that cuts are made, not in the pulp entertainment literature but in
books by quality authors. instead of defending what is culturally valuable,
librarians give in to popular demand in order to achieve high loan figures.
the relationship between the library service's reviews and library purchases
demonstrates this' well reviewed quality books are bought in small numbers,
whereas multiple copies are bought of entertainment literature, despite
lukewarm reviews.

discusses the situation in latin america's underdeveloped countries, with
particular reference to university libraries. examines the state of education
in general, where higher education has been developed usually at the expense
of the elementary stages; library development has benefited accordingly, but
although some university libraries are adequately resourced, rationalisation
and planning of future policies is essential to maximise use of resources.
hence librarians should develop definite selection and acquisition policies
using the advice of specialists, and disregarding restrictions of resources by
authorities unappreciative of the importance of libraries in promoting culture
and scientific knowledge.

legal problems connected with the use of electronic data processing, keeping
catalogues up to date and developing a courier service. since 1978 statistics

where postal services are slow, unreliable or expensive, dedicated transport
schemes for interlending purposes should be considered; their usefulness will
vary from 1 country to another, according to local circumstances. in the uk,
feasibility studies were followed by the setting up of transport schemes in a
number of the uk library regions, and a national scheme linking the regions
was envisaged. transport schemes were not considered worthwhile in the larger
regions with less interlending activity. a methodology for setting up schemes
has been devised. the present transport schemes are financially competitive
and likely to remain so. uk experience might provide a framework for assessing
potential schemes in other countries.

comments on a report by the delegation for scientific and technical
information provision' 2information at any price' on charging for information
services1, in which it is suggested that interlending from scientific
libraries should be charged at a standard rate per loan, despite the fact that
charging for traditional library services was excluded from the commission's
remit. 1 reason for considering charges nonetheless is the increasing scope
and cost of interlending. another is the change in the budgeting of
institutions for tertiary education which has transferred library allocations
from the state to the institutions; these are tempted to achieve savings
through charges on interlending. the report regards interlending of little
importance to public libraries. it does not attempt to calculate the cost of
interlending, nor the cost of administering a system of charges.

interlending in the netherlands is based on a national system for the supply
of scholarly literature and a regional system for supplying a wider range of
material mainly between public libraries. 725,000 requests were made in 1979.
most requests are satisfied through union catalogues or printed union lists.
in addition to the 12 provincial centres, the 13 regional support libraries
have a central role in the regional supply system; they received 131,708
requests in 1980 and satisfied 27%. a single centre in each region is
recommended. a survey of the national system showed that 40% of all requests
at this level came from academic libraries, 40% from special libraries and 20%
from public libraries. most requests are for science and technology (60%), for
english language material (55% of all requests; 70% of requests for journals),
and for more recent material (65% published in the last 10 years). the
satisfaction rate was 76% (higher for req uests sent to union catalogues): 1/2
were supplied in 2 weeks, 2/3 in 3 weeks important gaps in journal coverage
were identified. an on-line national union catalogue will be available in 1984
and will be used to distribute requests more evenly between libraries, but
specific grants to support the interlending function in major supplying
libraries will still be necessary, and charges should be made. improved union
catalogues are envisaged at the regional level also.

library policy, and the realistic possibilities connected with the literature
supply and corresponding need for an interlibrary loan programme in these
countries are pointed out. attention is also given to the relationship of the
local libraries to the national library. considerations which should be made
in finding realistic solutions to these problems on a long-term basis conclude
the report.

centralised national provision for interlending provides a better service than
decentralised provision but can be difficult and expensive to implement, so
partial centralisation should be considered. journals are specially suited to
central collections. concentration of demand on a relatively small number of
journals means that collections of 7,000-8,000 titles could supply 80% of
demand and 2,000 titles 50% in many countries. there are however problems in
identifying journals for core collections. bibliometric methods can be shown
to be of little help. analysis of demand at the british library lending
division indicates that rank lists are not very stable over time; and various
factors such as language or stage of economic development will cause
variations that make it difficult to apply core lists between countries
(though it may be possible to allow for differences, especially if core lists
based on current demand could be obtained from a number of different
countries). once a core collection had been set up, it would have to attract
sufficient requests to monitor demand and adjust its contents accordingly. if
a comprehensive collection is not possible, limitation to certain subjects has
advantages. as collections grow, additional journals will be cheaper to
acquire, though the unit cost per request will still be lower for the journals
in heaviest demand. concludes that the concept of core collections is sound,
but further data are needed before the practical problems of setting up such
collections can be properly assessed.

found that approximately 40% of all the reserve collection items never
circulated during the entire semester, and that 33% of the collection
circulated only 1-5 times during that period. it is suggested that librarians

contribution to an issue devoted to the german librarians conference at
regensburg, 9-13 june 81. for alphabetical cataloguing, regensburg university
library uses the rak rules for academic libraries; further streamlining will
be carried out here because the bavarian state library will shortly join the
bavarian new university libraries' interloan system. keyword use is
standardised; a keyword index published every 6 months assists in unifying
practice. english keywords are used for biology and pre-clinical medicine,
german for other subjects. regensburg university's own classification scheme
is used here and in other libraries in the interloan scheme. since 1974
printed catalogue volumes have been replaced by com-process microfiche, which
may in turn be replaced by on-line methods when these have become cheaper.
access to other regional library networks may soon be available through
electronic data processing.

testing. puts the proposals in the broader context in which they are set. they
system has 4 main components' on-line union catalogue; on-line bibliographic
source file; catalogue processing; and catalogue production. concludes that
the system will not succeed for economic reasons-it bundles with its offerings

the national library of australia has received permission to develop an
australian bibliographic network (abn), but no extra resources have been
granted for it; the service may therefore not be able to serve all its
potential participants as quickly as some would like. suggests that through
the creation of 'service centre' networks, and without the need for a major
supportive infrastructure from the national library, the benefits of the abn's
existence can be brought to a great many libraries. suggests ways in which abn
may be integrated into a national network which will coordinate the national
library's initiatives and the 'bottom-up' developments which have already
taken place and will continue to take place.

for more than 6 years, the ohio state university libraries have had public
terminals available for searching their library control system (lcs), a former
circulation system that is evolving into an on-line catalogue. patron
instruction in use of the system has expanded in parallel with the evolution
of lcs, moving from informal printed instructions to a standardised 1 hour
workshop. a year of experience has shown the workshop to be a valuable part of
the libraries' user-education programme and a particularly suitable approach
for on-line catalogue instruction.

the library of congress is replacing its card catalogue with a computerised
catalogue. describes the reactions of a reference librarian when a terminal
was installed in the reading room. searching was speeded up, with the
possibility of limiting searches to certain dates, languages or places of
origin. discusses the component word system which responds to a command to
find words anywhere in the title, subject headings, author's name, series, or
notes on a bibliographic entry, thus enabling librarians to solve the problem
of incomplete citations. in may 77 a computer catalogue centre was established
for the public near the main catalogue, which has proved extremely popular. a
user survey showed that computer-assisted instruction is needed. future plans
are outlined.

the need for a national periodical catalogue for public libraries has long

the public libraries in greater copenhagen published a catalogue of their
periodical holdings. in the provinces coverage is very uneven and with growth
in interlending the need for a union catalogue is now acute. the bibliographic
joint committee is now considering a project on such a catalogue and has asked
the library centre to prepare an editorial plan for input of bibliographic
data into its data base. it now appears that input cannot begin for financial
reasons until 1 jan 84. appeals to the library inspectorate to initiate a

librarians still cope badly with the principle of the narrow catchword because
their terminological control is still ineffective. the narrow catchword uses
precise terminology and separates related material; the broad catchword covers
wide subject areas and tends to result in the formation of hierarchies of
subordinated groups. die deutsche bibliothek (german national library) uses
mainly narrow catchwords, equating this with precise subject classification
but occasionally deviations from this principle occur. catchwords in some
subject areas are narrower than in others. terminology is carefully controlled
and this is essential when precise terms are used. if precise subject
definition and strict terminology control are closely linked then it follows
that precise subject definition can only be carried out in the user's interest
when sufficient numbers of well-trained staff are available.

discusses the choice of classification systems for general book collections
drawing particularly on experiences at the folksam library, fack, sweden,
which specialises in insurance. any new library must carefully consider the

headings for a wide variety of subjects. main headings of the system are
given.

between 1900 and 1905, rudolph focke published a series of papers on
classification theory and a draft of code for the construction of classified
catalogues. his work was the direct result of the reform of librarianship
during the last decades of the 19th century. the large number of
classification systems used by german university and research libraries was
seen as an obstacle to the development of national systems of bibliographic
control and access. the hope of standardisation came to nothing; focke's code
may even have had the opposite effect of perpetuating local systems well into
the 20th century. his work was introduced to librarians in the usa at a time
when subject cataloguing and classification were in transition. his code is
consistent with the general principles underlying the library of congress
classification, which may have been more influenced by 19th century german
classification than has hertofore been recognised. re port not available from

cooperation between similar firms or organisations or between complementary
branches of industry. the on-line market is internationally oriented and the
market leaders are mainly from english-speaking countries. the on-line
information market has developed more slowly in west germany than in
neighbouring countries. measures to counteract this should include' developing
information policy with regard for economic aspects; encouraging cooperation
between manufacturers and users; and concentrating the restricted supply of
government money so as to favour the growth of private enterprise.

presented at the deutscher dokumentartag, west berlin, 1980.) considers the
quantifiable characteristics of bibliographic data bases from the on-line
user's viewpoint. gives a brief overview of data base properties which have
been studied quantitatively' coverage, currency, costs, accuracy, indexing and
retrieval efficiency. indicates the value of such studies to the on-line user

biblio-data has developed since 1975 into the biggest literature data bank for
on-line searching in west germany. by dec 81 it was linked to 66 institutions
in germany and other european countries and had access via the stairs
retrieval system to euronet diane. over 900,000 documentary units are
available and 100,000 are added annually. the data bank aims to include
references to all new german monographs and periodicals, although not to
periodical articles, and retrieval is possible via all important data
elements. in service quality and quantity biblio-data is ahead of most printed
bibliographies; a special feature is a large store of dissertations from both
east and west germany. corrections, however, cannot yet be made and some
aspects of cataloguing require improvement.

describes a computer program for the purpose of satisfying incompletely
defined user needs through a man-machine dialogue which does not require a
query formulation by the user. the program attempts to satisfy the user's
needs from a model which it builds of his interests; a model which is a subset
of its own world model (the data base). explores the possibilities of the
program creating virtual world models to prevent the need for unnecessarily
accessing the whole data base and incorporating a form of weighting based on
association strengths between items in the data base.

thesaurus-based automatic indexing and automatic authority control share
common ground as word-matching processes. to demonstrate the resemblance, an
experimental system utilising automatic indexing as its core process was

of exploiting the resemblance between the 2 systems are examined.

for economic reasons the viability of automated subject cataloguing using main
entries is often considered. basic data available for this are the title,
sub-title and cip data but although the title may important it does not always
express the subject content accurately. in popular literature the title may be
eye-catching rather than accurate. problems can also be caused by foreign
languages, abbreviations, shortened or lengthened names for the same object,
homonyms and synonyms, especially in geographical material. many titles are
vague and incomplete or even incomprehensible if the subject of the book is
not already known. use of the title in automated subject cataloguing would
save work time but result in many false entries.

today technological innovations in many fields cause social changes almost
before society has become aware of their existence. very often negative
influences of certain innovations have not been thoroughly investigated
beforehand. this has led to the growth of many counter movements in society.
it is necessary to find common ground between representatives of 'established'
and 'alternative' styles of living, in order to ensure the continuation of
innovation in society. initiative, creativity and cooperation, the vital
factors for technological and economic innovation, are evident in both groups,
only opinions as to the best means of employing them differ. today a new
electronic information network is gradually linking mankind. the world is
becoming a 'global village' at least on the level of technological
communications structures. this network may enable us to progress to a
rational world model in which everyone will have a chance in  life.

few parents regularly read stories aloud to their children. the affectionate
atmosphere given by reading a story is reassuring and security-building at any
age. it is a mistake to discontinue the practice. the child learns language,
and about the written word through this. reading to him can help him to
understand concepts he cannot grasp by reading to himself. literature with
humour, insight and maturity needs to be sought. children from literary rather
than gifted backgrounds are the best readers.

that neither teachers nor librarians are as active as they might be in

contemporary affairs and african nationalism but scientific, religious and art
bibliographies are also discussed. it appears that initiative in local

in 1954, a bibliographic joint committee was set up, whose task was to
coordinate danish bibliographic publishing and initiate bibliographies where
needed. it was to advise the library centre through participation in long term
planning. in reality, control was left to the publishers and initiatives for
new publications to individuals, international bodies and pressure groups.
this situation is unlikely to change until the library commission's proposal
for establishment of a national bibliographic council with responsibility for
control of the national bibliography and state financing has been implemented.
as long as the library centre has monopoly on production, it can dictate that
libraries must pay high prices or else make do with fewer and inferior
bibliographies. the librarians' union has therefore called for nationalisation
of the national bibliography with free distribu tion to libraries.

bibliographic bulletin, and a number of productions from commercial publishers
and institutions. concludes that until legal deposit is enforced and the
national library bulletin issued on a regular basis, the national bibliography
will remain inadequate.

since july 81, colorado has had 2 censorship statutes. the 1st, senate bill

read, seen or heard. the 2nd, the result of house bill 1310, states that no
material 'harmful to children' may be located where children might read, and
thus effectively prohibits adults from the same material unless bookstores bar
admittance to under-18s. despite the us constitution and bill of rights,

the primary journal has been the most important formal medium for the
dissemination of scientific information for over 3 centuries. a number of
criticisms can be levelled against it viz. the publication process is time
consuming and expensive while journal proliferation ensures the scattering of
related information. recent innovations such as computer-aided production,
microform publication and letter and synopsis journals have attempted to
overcome these drawbacks. alternatives to the traditional journal such as the
computer-based editorial processing centre and the electronic journal have
been mooted and are considered viable in the near future although it is likely
that they will be resisted by the scientific community.

part of the text of a preliminary discussion paper prepared by unesco for the

book and its traditional role as the chief means of transmitting knowledge.
the possibilities raised by microforms and computers are surveyed, in relation
to the contrasting situations in the industrialised and developing countries.
the serious problems created by paper shortage, despite increased production
in some areas, are examined, with statistical data showing production and
consumption in 1st and 3rd world countries. the tendency appears now to be
