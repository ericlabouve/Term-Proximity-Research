adjList.json gives all the adjacency nodes of each node.

edgeList.json gives edges between two nodes and the weight of the edge.

idToLabel.json and labelToId.json give the mapping from ID to node label.

wfVertexDB contains a list of all the nodes that are word forms (i.e., word expressions). The rest of the nodes are senses.
